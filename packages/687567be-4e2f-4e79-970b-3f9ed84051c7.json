	"notes": "This dataset depicts the terrestrial boundaries of the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCC) within Alaska. Those LCCs are: Aleutian and Bering Sea Islands, Arctic, North Pacific, Northwest Boreal, and Western Alaska. These boundaries are derived from the master LCC Boundary dataset maintained by USFWS, but portions of these polygons have been modified. The specific modification are listed below: ARCTIC LCC: Portions of the polygon were edited to more closely match the coastline and the boundary was also edited to include the Colville River. WESTERN ALASKA LCC: Nulato Hills expansion: There are a number of reasons why the boundary of the Western Alaska LCC (WALCC) was modified to include the Nulato Hills Ecoregion. First, this Ecoregion is a transitional zone that fits equally well within either the WALCC or the Northwest Boreal LCC. Also, the Nulato Hills are the primary land route linking the northern and southern portions of the WALCC and as such, will likely serve as a conduit allowing species to migrate north from more southern portions of the LCC. Finally, including the Nulato Hills as part of WALCC was advantageous because it encouraged close coordination among stakeholders involved in establishing the LCC and completion of the Bureau of Land Management\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Seward Peninsula-Nulato Hills-Kotzebue Lowlands Rapid Ecoregional Assessment. Lake Clark expansion: The south central portion of the WALCC was modified so that it included all the watersheds that flow into Bristol Bay. Yukon River drainage contraction: The villages of Koyukuk, Nulato, Kaltag, Grayling, Anvik, and Holy Cross are including within the NWBLCC. These Athabascan communities have more cultural similarities to other villages within the NWBLCC, and are represented by the Alaska Native non-governmental organization, Tanana Chiefs Conference, which participates in the NWBLCC LCC partnership community. The final boundary in the Nulato Hills area was placed at the hydrological divide between the Norton Sound and the tributaries of the Yukon and Koyukuk Rivers. This is a logical division from a geographic and ecological perspective, particularly with respect to the fisheries resources and the terrestrial vegetation types of the area. NORTHWEST BOREAL LCC: Nulato Hills contraction: Portions of the Nulato Hills art of the Lime Hills ecorgeion were removed. Yukon River drainage expansion: The villages of Koyukuk, Nulato, Kaltag, Grayling, Anvik, and Holy Cross are including within the NWBLCC. These Athabascan communities have more cultural similarities to other villages within the NWBLCC, and are represented by the Alaska Native non-governmental organization, Tanana Chiefs Conference, which participates in the NWBLCC partnership community. The final boundary in the Nulato Hills area was placed at the hydrological divide between the Norton Sound and the tributaries of the Yukon and Koyukuk Rivers. This is a logical division from a geographic and ecological perspective, particularly with respect to the fisheries resources and the terrestrial vegetation types of the area. Lake Clark contraction: The southwest portion of the LCC was modified so that all the watersheds that flow into Bristol Bay now belong to WALCC.",
