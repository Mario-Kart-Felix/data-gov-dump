    (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japan   satellite mission to monitor tropical and subtropical
    precipitation and to estimate its associated latent heating.n                                    nThe
    TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR), the first of its kind in space, is an electronically
    scanning radar, operating at 13.8 GHz that measures the 3-D rainfall distribution
    over both land and ocean, and defines  the layer depth of the precipitation.n                                    nThe
    1B21 calculates the received power at the PR receiver input point from the Level-0
    count value which is linearly proportional to the logarithm of the PR receiver output
    power. To convert the count value to the input power, extensive internal calibrations
    are applied, which are mainly based upon the system model, temperature dependence
    of model parameters and many temperature sensors attached at various locations of
    the PR. Periodically the input-output characteristics are measured using an internal
    calibration loop for the IF unit and later receiver stages. To make an absolute
    calibration, an Active Radar Calibrator (ARC) is placed at Kansai Branch of CRL
    and overall system gain of the PR is being measured every 2 months.  Using the transfer
    function based on the above internal and external calibrations, the PR received
    power is obtained. Note that the value assumes that the signal follows the Rayleigh
    fading, so if the fading characteristics of a scatter is different, a small bias
    error may occur (within 1 or 2 dB).n                                    nThe data
    are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), which includes both core and product
    specific metadata applicable to the PR measurements.  A file contains a single orbit
    of data with a file size of about 139 MB (uncompressed). The HDF-EOS "swath" structure
    is used to accommodate the actual geophysical data arrays. There are 16 files each
    of PR 1B21 and 1C21 data produced per day.n                                    nSpatial
    coverage is between 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South, owing to the 35 degree
    inclination of the TRMM satellite. This orbit provides extensive coverage in the
    tropics and allows each location to be covered at a different local time each day,
    enabling the analysis of the diurnal cycle of precipitation. There are, in general,
    9150 scans along the orbit, with each scan consisting of 49 rays.  The scan width
    is about 220 km.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
