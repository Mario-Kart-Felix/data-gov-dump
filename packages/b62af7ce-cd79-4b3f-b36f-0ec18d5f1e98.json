It provides an electronic,\r\n               spatially referenced representation of the international boundary that may be used for the purposes of displaying the boundary and to integrate\r\n               binational datasets tied into the boundary line.  The international boundary contained in this dataset corresponds to the line displayed in the\r\n\t       2008 IBWC Boundary Maps, which were approved by Minute 315 in November 2009.  Please note that this boundary is only for reference purposes.  If there is\r\n\t       a need for a legal or authoritative boundary location, do NOT use this dataset.  Instead, contact the IBWC Boundary and Realty Office. ",
