  of the CRCP-funded project aimed at establishing baseline Rapid Ecological Assessment
  (REA) surveys for coral reef benthic cover and composition at Faga'alu Bay, Tutuila,
  American Samoa. Quantitative belt transect surveys for coral generic abundance and
  diseases condition were conducted, from 20120326 to 20120331 at 21 sites by the
  Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science
  Center (PIFSC). As a part of REA surveys, the coral belt surveys were focused on
  quantifying the diversity, abundance, and density, of the anthozoan and hydrozoan
  corals as well as the condition and health state of the coral reef populations.
  The surveys were conducted along two consecutively-placed, 25 m transect lines.
  The belt width was 1 m wide, 0.5 m on each side of the transect line. Within each
  25 m transect, five 2.5 m segments were surveyed (beginning at points: 0, 5, 10,
  15, and 20 meters), whereby in each segment, all coral colonies whose center fell
  within 0.5 m of either side of the transect line were identified to the lowest taxonomic
  level possible (genus or species) and two planar size metrics were collected: maximum
  diameter and diameter perpendicular to the maximum diameter. In addition, the extent
  of mortality, both recent and old, was estimated for each colony. Observers paid
  special attention to identifying as best as possible the extent of the former live
  colony. When a coral colony exhibited signs of disease or compromised health, additional
  information was recorded including type of affliction (bleaching, skeletal growth
  anomaly, white syndrome, tissue loss other than white syndrome, trematodiasis, necrosis,
  other, pigmentation responses, algal overgrowth, and predation), severity of the
  affliction (mild, moderate, marked, severe, acute), as well as photographic documentation
  and occasional tissue samples. Tissue samples were cataloged and fixed in buffered
  zinc-formalin solution for further histopathological analyses. Raw survey data included
  species presence and relative abundance, colony counts per taxon, size (width and
  length), mortality, predation, and health status. A surveyed area was ranging from
  10 m^2 to 25 m^2 per site.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819\",\n\t\"extras\":
