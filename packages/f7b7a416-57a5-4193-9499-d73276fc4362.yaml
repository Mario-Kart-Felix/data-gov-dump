    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;The actuation of the hybrids relies
    on spinning three internal flywheels, which allows all subsystems to be packaged
    in one sealed enclosure and enables the platforms to be minimalistic, thereby reducing
    the cost of the mission architecture. The hybrids would be deployed from a mother
    spacecraft, which would then act as a communication relay to Earth and would aid
    the in-situ assets with tasks such as localization and navigation.&amp;nbsp;In Phase
    I, we demonstrated that the bounding assumptions behind our proposed mission architecture
    are reasonable, and have a sound scientific and engineering basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase
    II has two objectives. First, to advance from TRL 2 to TRL 3.5 the mobility subsystem
    of the hybrids (comprising planning/control and localization/navigation), with the
    aid of a unique test bed for low-gravity surface mobility and parabolic flight tests
    on a zero-g airplane. Second, to study at a conceptual level (TRL 2) system engineering
    aspects for the hybrids, with a focus on power, in the context of a mission to Mars&amp;#39;
    moon Phobos. Collectively, our study aims to demonstrate that exploration via controlled
    mobility in low-gravity environments is technically possible, economically feasible,
    and would enable a focused, yet compelling set of science objectives aligned with
    NASA&amp;#39;s interests in science and human exploration. Indeed, while controlled
    mobility in low-gravity environments was identified by the National Research Council
    in 2012 as one of NASA&amp;#39;s high priorities for technology development, it
    has never been demonstrated in a high-fidelity low-gravity test bed. Hence, this
    proposal, if successful, would provide a sought-after and currently unavailable
    capability for small bodies exploration.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title": "U.S.

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
