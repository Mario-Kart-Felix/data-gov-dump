  of population from 2015 to 2025 by age and sex for Illinois, Chicago and Illinois
  counties produced for the Certificate of Need (CON) Program. rnAs actual future
  population trends are unknown, the projected numbers should not be considered a
  precise prediction of the future population; rather, these projections, calculated
  under a specific set of assumptions, indicate the levels of population that would
  result if our assumptions about each population component (births, deaths and net
  migration) hold true. The assumptions used in this report, and the details presented
  below, generally assume a continuation of current trends. rnrnMethodologyrnThese
  projections were produced using a demographic cohort-component projection model.
  In this model, each component of population change u2013 birth, death and net migration
  u2013 is projected separately for each five-year birth cohort and sex.  The cohort
  u2013 component method employs the following basic demographic balancing equation:rn
  \               P1 = P0 + B u2013 D + NMrnWhere:rn                P1 = Population
  at the end of the period;rn                P0 = Population at the beginning of the
  period;rn                B = Resident births during the period;rn                D
  = Resident deaths during the period; andrn           NM = Net migration (Inmigration
  u2013 Outmigration) during the period.rnThe model roughly works as  follows: for
  every five-year projection period, the base population, disaggregated by five-year
  age groups and sex, is u201csurvivedu201d to the next five-year period by applying
  the appropriate survival rates for each age and sex group; next, net migrants by
  age and sex are added to the survived population. The population under 5 years of
  age is generated by applying age specific birth rates to the survived females in
  childbearing age (15 to 49 years). rnrnBase PopulationrnThese projections began
  with the July 1, 2010 population estimates by age and sex produced by the U.S. Census
  Bureau. The most recent census population of April 1, 2010 was the base for July
  1, 2010 population estimates. rnrnSpecial PopulationsrnIn 19 counties, the college
  dormitory population or adult inmates in correctional facilities accounted for 5
  percent or more of the total population of the county; these counties were considered
  as special counties. There were six college dorm counties (Champaign, Coles, DeKalb,
  Jackson, McDonough and McLean) and 13 correctional facilities counties (Bond, Brown,
  Crawford, Fayette, Fulton, Jefferson, Johnson, Lawrence, Lee, Logan, Montgomery,
  Perry and Randolph) that qualified as special counties. When projecting the population,
  these special populations were first subtracted from the base populations for each
  special county; then they were added back to the projected population to produce
  the total population projections by age and sex. The base special population by
  age and sex from the 2010 population census was used for this purpose with the assumption
  that this population will remain the same throughout each projection period.rnrnMortality
  rnFuture deaths were projected by applying age and sex specific survival rates to
  each age and sex specific base population. The assumptions on survival rates were
  developed on the basis of trends of mortality rates in the individual life tables
  constructed for each level of geography for 1989-1991, 1999-2001 and 2009-2011.
  The application of five-year survival rates provides a projection of the number
  of persons from the initial population expected to be alive in five years. Resident
  deaths data by age and sex from 1989 to 2011 were provided by the Illinois Center
  for Health Statistics (ICHS), Illinois Department of Public Health.rnrnFertilityrnTotal
  fertility rates (TFRs) were first computed for each county. For most counties, the
  projected 2015 TFRs were computed as the average of the 2000 and 2010 TFRs. 2010
  or 2015 rates were retained for 2020 projections, depending on the birth trend of
  each county. The age-specific birth rates (ASBR) were next computed for each county
  by multiplying the 2010 ASBR by each projected TFR. Total births were then projected
  for each county by applying age-specific birth rates to the projected female population
  of reproductive ages (15 to 49 years). The total births were broken down by sex,
  using an assumed sex-ratio at birth. These births were survived five years applying
  assumed survival ratios to get the projected population for the age group 0-4. For
  the special counties, special populations by age and sex were taken out before computing
  age-specific birth rates. The resident birth data used to compute age-specific birth
  rates for 1989-1991, 1999-2001 and 2009-2011 came from ICHS. Births to females younger
  than 15 years of age were added to those of the 15-19 age group and births to women
  older than 49 years of age were added to the 45-49 age group.rnrnNet MigrationrnMigration
  is the major component of population change in Illinois, Chicago and Illinois counties.
  \ The state is experiencing a significant loss of population through internal (domestic
  migration within the U.S.) net migration. Unlike data on births and deaths, migration
  data based on administrative records are not available on a regular basis. Most
  data on migration are collected through surveys or indirectly from administrative
  records (IRS individual tax returns). For this report, net migration trends have
  been reviewed using data from different sources and methods (such as residual method)
  from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Illinois Department of Public Health,
  individual exemptions data from the Internal Revenue Service, and survey data from
  the U.S. Census Bureau. On the basis of knowledge gained through this review and
  of levels of net migration from different sources, assumptions have been made that
  Illinois will have annual net migrants of -40, 000, -35,000 and -30,000 during 2010-2015,
  2015-2020 and 2020-2025, respectively. These figures have been distributed among
  the counties, using age and sex distribution of net migrants during 1995-2000. The
  2000 population census was the last decennial census, which included the question
  u201cWhere did you live five years ago?u201d The age and sex distribution of the
  net migrants was derived, using answers to this question.  The net migration for
  Chicago has been derived independently, using census survival method for 1990-2000
  and 2000-2010 under the assumption that the annual net migration for Chicago will
  be -40,000, -30,000 and -25,000 for 2010-2015, 2015-2020 and 2020-2025, respectively.
  The age and sex distribution from the 2000-2010 net migration was used to distribute
  the net migrants for the projection periods.rnrnConclusionrnThese projections were
  prepared for use by the Certificate of Need (CON) Program; they are produced using
  evidence-based techniques, reasonable assumptions and the best available input data.
  However, as assumptions of future demographic trends may contain errors, the resulting
  projections are unlikely to be free of errors. In general, projections of small
  areas are less reliable than those for larger areas, and the farther in the future
  projections are made, the less reliable they may become. When possible, these projections
  should be regularly reviewed and updated, using more recent birth, death and migration
  data.\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"License Not Specified\",\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\":
