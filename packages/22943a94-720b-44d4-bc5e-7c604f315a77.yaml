  (AQM) on-board ISS provides specific information for a number of target compounds
  in the air. However, there is a significant subset of common target compounds between
  air and water.&amp;nbsp; Naturally, the following question arises, &amp;ldquo;Can
  the AQM be used for both air and water quality monitoring?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;
  Previous directorate-level IR&amp;amp;D funding led to the development of a water
  sample introduction method for mass spectrometry using electro-thermal vaporization
  (ETV).&amp;nbsp; This vaporization source allows analytes in water samples to enter
  the gas phase, where they can be analyzed using a variety of techniques.&amp;nbsp;
  This project will focus on the integration of the ETV with a ground-based AQM.&amp;nbsp;
  The capabilities of this integrated platform will be evaluated using a subset of
  toxicologically important compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ETV unit was constructed
  using two glass tubes and a nichrome ribbon powered by a programmable DC power supply
  (G W Instec, PSM-3004).&amp;nbsp; The nichrome ribbon was threaded through two 3-mm
  wide, 1-cm-long slot cuts on the inner tube placed 1.5 cm past the inlet.&amp;nbsp;
  The ribbon was held securely by compressing it between the inner tube and two halves
  of an outer glass tube.&amp;nbsp; These halves were held together using a flexible
  metal clamp.&amp;nbsp; Inside the inner tube the ribbon was slightly curved, and
  an indent (1 mm diameter) was made on its surface for depositing a measured liquid
  sample drop.&amp;nbsp; The ribbon was positioned in the upper half of the inner
  tube in such a way that the edge of the ribbon faced the front (inlet) side of the
  ETV unit.&amp;nbsp; Holes (1 mm diameter) were made on the outer and inner glass
  tubes for sample introduction and were aligned with the ribbon indent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
  viability of the ETV approach for the analysis of water analytes was demonstrated
  using a ground-based, laboratory scale analyzer (reference:&amp;nbsp; Dwivedi, P.
  et al.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;Electro-Thermal Vaporization Direct Analysis in Real
  Time-Mass Spectrometry for Water Contaminant Analysis During Space Missions,&amp;rdquo;
  Analytical Chemistry, 85, 9898-9906 (2013)).&amp;nbsp; The work in this proposal
  will extend that effort and interface the ETV to a ground version of the current
  in-flight AQM.&amp;nbsp; Liquid sample will be introduce via a pipet through the
  sample injection port and placed onto the nichrome ribbon heated to a set temperature
  by an external, programmable power supply.&amp;nbsp; Upon vaporization of the water
  sample, the target analytes will be swept into the AQM Sample-In port using nitrogen
  carrier gas.&amp;nbsp; A vapor-phase analysis can then be performed by the AQM to
  identify and quantify the target analytes in the water samples.&amp;nbsp; Parameters
  to be optimized include water sample size, carrier gas sweep rate, and ribbon temperature.&amp;nbsp;
  The operating parameters of the vapor-phase analysis performed by the AQM will also
  need to be modified for this type of sampling methodology.&amp;nbsp; A simple two-position
  valve attached to the ETV and a diverter tube will allow for manual selection of
  either a water sample through the ETV or an air sample through the diverter tube.&amp;nbsp;
  The primary objective of this effort is to evaluate the viability of the ETV with
  ground-based, flight hardware.&amp;nbsp; A proof-of-concept unit capable of water
  and air analysis utilizing the ETV will be developed.&amp;nbsp; The target water
  analytes to be used in this work will come from a list provided by the water SMEs
  in the Toxicology and Environmental Chemistry Laboratories at JSC.&amp;nbsp; These
  analytes are commonly observed in the ground analysis of water samples from ISS.&amp;nbsp;
  A preliminary engineering evaluation of this set-up could potentially be performed
  with the goal of formulating a viable plan of integrating the ETV to the control
  software and power supply of the AQM.&amp;nbsp; This plan could serve as a starting
  point for further development.&amp;nbsp; This work will advance this project from
  a TRL of 3 to a TRL of 5. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
