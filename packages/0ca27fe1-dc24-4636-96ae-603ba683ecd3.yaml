    technology for cost-effective high-performance advanced space telescopes for astrophysics
    and Earth science applications. These applications require instruments with large
    aperture light-weight highly reflecting mirrors and precision optical surfaces to
    gain a better understanding of how the universe works. The hard and soft X-ray mirrors
    have stringent surface requirements.  If awarded a Phase I our plan would be to
    combine previous knowledge of OptiPro's UltraSurf metrology system with newly developed
    software. Our goal would be to create a robust solution for combining the measurement
    data of the mirrors with corrective machine grinding and polishing process toolpaths.
     This proposal includes the investigation utilizing non-contact probes on OptiPro's
    machining platforms to quantify the potential opportunities for in-situ mirror measurements.
     Understanding these surface irregularities and what in the manufacturing processes
    causes them is critical for improving the current TRL's. OptiPro Systems will develop
    a metrology system and software, that would provide feedback for manufacturing these
    precision mirrors and include final metrology measurement of global form error and
    mid-spatial content. Comparison of in-situ and off-line metrology will be key for
    improving the manufacturing processes. We envision that the work performed in Phase
    I would lead to a software and metrology solution to be built and delivered to NASA
    if awarded a Phase II.  OptiPro's technologically advanced optical manufacturing
    capabilities along with our support partnership with the University of Rochester
    Mechanical Engineering Department, gives us a very strong team and a clear path
    towards solving the difficult challenges for measuring these large complex mirrors
    and cylindrical shells. Our goal is to provide an innovative and complete manufacturing
    solution for the companies that are fabricating these optical components for NASA.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
