  coverage with similar historic datasets, we flew 32 east-west-oriented uniform transects
  (spaced at 15' latitude [27.8-km] intervals) when possible to the 2000-m isobath
  (includes shelf, slope, and rise waters). At the request of BOEM, we included six
  focal-area surveys nested within the overall broad transect survey area. Each focal-area
  survey consisted of ten 25-km, parallel transect lines targeting shelf waters and
  spaced at 6-km intervals. This pattern (broad survey lines and Focal Area survey
  lines) was surveyed during each oceanographic season: summer (June-July), fall (September-October),
  and winter (January-February) during 2011 and 2012. Aerial survey methods follow
  Mason et al. (2007) with slight modifications. Specifically, we recorded all sightings
  of marine animals, vessels, and floating objects from twin-engine, high wing aircraft
  (Partenavia P-68, Aspen Helicopters, Oxnard, CA, or Commander AC-500, GoldAero,
  Arlington, WA) along pre-determined 150-m (75 m per side) strip transects at 60-m
  above sea level. Surveys were flown at 160 km h-1, and we used a Global Positioning
  System (GPS) unit linked to a laptop computer that allowed us to simultaneously
  collect coordinates (WGS-84 map datum), sea surface temperature (SST, degrees Celcius
  [u00c2u00b0C]) determined via a belly-mounted pyrometer, and ocean color data via
  an onboard radiometer (see Remote sensing methods).We maintained the same two trained
  observers throughout the study. During individual surveys, observers frequently
  verified strip widths using hand-held clinometers. Observations generally were discontinued
  when glare exceeded &gt;25% of the field-of-view or if sea state exceeded Beaufort
  5 (29-38 km h-1wind speed). Observations were recorded into hand-held digital audio
  recorders. The third (non-dedicated) observer assisted the pilot with navigation,
  monitored sensor data, and maintained the onboard computer. Observations of species
  or individuals identified to nearest taxon included number of individuals, time,
  pre-coded behaviors, flight direction, and interspecies or vessel associations.
  Digital recordings of observations were archived and used by observers after surveys
  to enter data into a customized Graphical User Interface in ACCESS (Microsoft).
  Observation data were proofed after transcription to ensure accuracy or to resolve
  inconsistencies. Species observations were linked with GPS-based tracklines generated
  at 1 to 3 second intervals. Based on variations in the lag-time between sightings
  and recordings, we estimate that observations have a nominal along-trackline spatial
  accuracy of 222 m, based on a five-second lag at 160 km hr-1survey speed.This file
  geodatabase table contains the flight track data from the aerial surveys. This data
  includes the date and time (DATETIME), the latitude (LAT) and longitude (LON), the
  number of observers (NOOBS), the left and right observers initials (LObs, RObs),
  the sea state condition (Baeufort), the sea surface temperature (SST), the focal
  transect number (FocTran), the broad transect number (BroTran), the lines flown
  between transects (DeadTran), and a unique ID number (NewIDNum).References:Bonnel,
