	"notes": "The CalFish Abundance Database contains a comprehensive collection of anadromous fisheries abundance information. Beginning in 1998, the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, began a cooperative project aimed at collecting, archiving, and entering into standardized electronic formats, the wealth of information generated by fisheries resource management agencies and tribes throughout California. Extensive data are currently available for chinook, coho, and steelhead. Major data categories include adult abundance population estimates, actual fish and\/or carcass counts, counts of fish collected at dams, weirs, or traps, and redd counts. Harvest data has also been compiled for many streams. This CalFish Abundance Database shapefile was generated from fully routed 1:100,000 hydrography. In a few cases streams had to be added to the hydrography dataset in order to provide a means to create shapefiles to represent abundance data associated with them. Streams added were digitized at no more than 1:24,000 scale based on stream line images portrayed in 1:24,000 Digital Raster Graphics (DRG). These features represent abundance information resulting from counts at weirs, fish ladders, or other point-type monitoring protocols such as beach seining. The point features in this layer typically represent the location for which abundance data records apply. In many cases there are multiple datasets associated with the same point location, and so, point features overlap. Please view the associated datasets for detail regarding specific features. In CalFish these are accessed through the \"link\" field that is visible when performing an identify or query operation. A URL string is provided with each feature in the downloadable data which can also be used to access the underlying datasets. The steelhead data that is available via the CalFish website is actually linked direct",
