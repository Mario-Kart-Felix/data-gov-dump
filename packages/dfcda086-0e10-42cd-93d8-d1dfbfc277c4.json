	"notes": "This data set includes biophysical measurements collected in 2009 from five New England experimental forest stations: Bartlett Experimental Forest, Harvard Forest, Howland Research Forest, Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, and the Penobscot Experimental Forest. Howland measurements were repeated in 2010 and one site in the Sierra National Forest, California, was surveyed in 2008. Biomass in respective measurement plots was calculated with allometric equations using measured diameter at breast height (DBH) for trees greater than 10 cm and species identification. Within selected subplots, the number of stems with diameters less than 10 cm were counted and classified to allow for an estimate of biomass for these stems.  There are 16 data files provided that present the biophysical measurement results and the biomass estimates in ASCII comma-separated format.  For a subset of sites and plots (Bartlett Experimental Forest, Harvard Forest and Howland Research Forest), more intensive inventories were done in coordination with Echidna lidar imaging (Strahler et al., 2008). In these intensive collections, the stem location, species, DBH and live\/dead status were recorded for all stems with total stem height and canopy dimensions recorded for every tenth stem. In addition, for stems below 10 cm DBH, species and count were recorded in a subplot of each intensive inventory plot. See the related data set Strahler et al., 2011.Investigators from Federal and university laboratories conducted these field campaign to make estimates of forest biophysical attributes that will prove useful in comparisons with airborne lidar (LVIS) and UAVSAR remote sensing acquisitions. The North American Carbon Program (NACP) is a multi-disciplinary research program designed to obtain scientific understanding of North America's carbon sources and sinks and of the changes in carbon stocks needed to meet societal concerns, and to provide tools for decision makers. NACP began in 2002 and continues to date. The NACP data collection contains continental carbon budgets, dynamics, processes, and management of the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide, methane, and carbon monoxide in North America and in adjacent ocean regions.

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
