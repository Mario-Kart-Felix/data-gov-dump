    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The NASA Airspace Systems Program (ASP)
    uses a large suite of models, simulations, and laboratories to develop and assess
    new ATM concepts and technologies. Most of these capabilities focus on aircraft
    movements, evaluating the impact of airport and airspace constraints on traffic
    flows. Emphasis is placed on the actions and interactions of the flight deck and
    air traffic controllers, including tactical ATC and traffic flow management at the
    FAA System Command Center and traffic management units (TMUs). The role of the airline
    operations center (AOC) in these analyses tends to be limited and recognized primarily
    as a communications mechanism and not an independent actor with designated legal
    responsibilities and decision making authority.   In a NextGen environment, the
    AOC will be a major participant, as it offers greater situation awareness across
    the entire airline network, with superior access to data, analytical capability,
    and communications.rnOur proposed AOC simulation offers several innovations to support
    ASP research and the aviation community:rn1. Provide a stand-alone simulation for
    analyzing AOCs and their complex interactions with ATM.rn2. Increase the realism
    with which NASA can evaluate new ATM concepts, technologies, and algorithms that
    affect airline operations, from flight planning to flight following and re-routing,
    and gate-to-gate aircraft movement control.rn3. Provide airlines with the ability
    to evaluate the effects of NASA ATM research products on their operations, investment
    criteria, and internal decision processes.rn4. Offer a simulation that can integrate
    with other NASA models and simulations, expanding NASA's system-wide evaluation,
    gate-to-gate modeling and simulation  capability.rn5. Uses industry-standard inputs
    for flight schedules, messages, and timekeeping to maximize usability by airlines
    and NASA.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
