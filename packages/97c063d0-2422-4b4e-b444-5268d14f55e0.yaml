  program is designed as a resource that can be adapted to specific contexts including
  those outside the United States and in languages other than English. Based on evidence-based
  practices, this program is a smoking cessation intervention for smokers who are
  ready to quit smoking. Although evidence supports the use of text messaging as a
  platform to deliver cessation interventions, it is expected that the maximum effect
  of the program will be demonstrated when it is integrated into other elements of
  a national tobacco control strategy.  The QuitNowTXT program is designed to deliver
  tips, motivation, encouragement and fact-based information via unidirectional and
  interactive bidirectional message formats. The core of the program consists of messages
  sent to the user based on a scheduled quit day identified by the user. Messages
  are sent for up to four weeks pre-quit date and up to six weeks post quit date.
  Messages assessing mood, craving, and smoking status are also sent at various intervals,
  and the user receives messages back based on the response they have submitted. In
  addition, users can request assistance in dealing with craving, stress/mood, and
  responding to slips/relapses by texting specific key words to the QuitNow. Rotating
  automated messages are then returned to the user based on the keyword. Details of
  the program are provided below. Texting STOP to the service discontinues further
  texts being sent.  This option is provided every few messages as required by the
  United States cell phone providers.  It is not an option to remove this feature
  if the program is used within the US.  If a web-based registration is used, it is
  suggested that users provide demographic information such as age, gender, and smoking
  frequency (daily or almost every day, most days, only a few days a week, only on
  weekends, a few times a month or less) in addition to their mobile phone number
  and quit date. This information will be useful for assessing the reach of the program,
  as well as identifying possible need to develop libraries to specific groups. The
  use of only a mobile phone-based registration system reduces barriers for participant
  entry into the program but limits the collection of additional data. At bare minimum,
  quit date must be collected.  At sign up, participants will have the option to choose
  a quit date up to one month out. Text messages will start up to 14 days before their
  specified quit date. Users also have the option of changing their quit date at any
  time if desired. The program can also be modified to provide texts to users who
  have already quit within the last month.  One possible adaptation of the program
  is to include a QuitNowTXT \"light\" version. This adaptation would allow individuals
  who do not have unlimited text messaging capabilities but would still like to receive
  support to participate by controlling the number of messages they receive. In the
  light program, users can text any of the programmed keywords without fully opting
  in to the program. Program Design: The program is designed as a 14-day countdown
  to quit date, with subsequent six weeks of daily messages. Each day within the program
  is identified as either a pre-quit date (Q- # days) or a post-quit date (Q+#). If
  a user opts into the program fewer than 14 days before their quit date, the system
  will begin sending messages on that day. For example, if they opt in four days prior
  to their quit date, the system will send a welcome message and recognize that they
  are at Q-4 (or four days before their quit date), and they will receive the message
  that everyone else receives four days before their quit date. As the user progresses
  throughout the program, they will receive messages outlined in the text message
  library. Throughout the program, users will receive texts that cover a variety of
  content areas including tips, informational content, motivational messaging, and
  keyword responses. The frequency of messages increases as the days leading up to
  and following the user's quit date, with a heavy emphasis on support, efficacy building,
  and actionable tips. Further away from a user's quit date, the messages will reduce
  in frequency. If the user says they have started to smoke again, the system will
  give them the option of continuing the program as planned or starting over and setting
  a new quit date.  The system is also designed to assess the user's mood, craving
  level, and smoking status several times during the program. These assessment messages
  are characterized as MOOD, CRAVE, and STATUS messages. Whenever the system asks
  for a response from the user, it will send a programmed response based on the user's
  answer (i.e., if the user responds with MOOD = BAD then they will receive a message
  customized to that response). These programmed response messages rotate throughout
  the course of the program. Users can also send the system one of three programmed
  keywords (CRAVE, MOOD, and SLIP), and the system will send unique, automated responses
  based on the texted keyword. There are 10 messages for each of the programmed keywords,
  which rotate on a random basis, decreasing the likelihood the user will get the
  same response in a row.  After the full six-week program comes to an end, the system
  will follow up at one, three, and six months to check on the user's smokefree status
  and offer additional assistance if needed.  Message Types: -'''u00a2 Tips: Tips
  provide users with actionable strategies on how to manage cravings and deal with
  quitting smoking in general. -'''u00a2 Motivation/encouragement: Motivational messages
  encourage users to keep going on their smokefree journey despite the difficulty
  and struggle they may be facing. -'''u00a2 Information: Informational messages provide
  users with facts and other salient points about the impact of smoking relevant to
  their socio-cultural environment. -'''u00a2 Assessment: The assessment messages
  are built into the text messaging program and are designed to collect information
  about the user's experience as they are quitting and provide immediate feedback
  based on the user's response. Assessment messages fall along three dimensions: mood,
  craving, and smoking status. -'''u00a2 Reactive Messaging (Key Words): At any point,
  the user can initiate an interaction with the program that will return a text message
  relevant to the user's request for help. In response to the user texting one of
  the key words, the system will send them unique, automated responses. The key words
  cover topics relevant to various aspects of cessation.</p>n\",\n\t\"license_title\":
