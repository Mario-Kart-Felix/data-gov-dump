    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    format). One file contains site characteristics, stand descriptors, and above-ground
    biomass and ANPP data for seven old-growth temperate forest stands and one young
    cove forest stand in the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. The old-growth stands
    (> 200 years old) span several watersheds on the north slope of the mountains at
    elevations ranging from 720 to 1,140 m. The younger stand (48-63 years old, elevation
    910 m) developed after agricultural abandonment. The second file contains monthly
    mean climate data averaged over four years (1947-1950) from four climate stations
    located along an elevational gradient (445-1,920 m) in Great Smoky Mountains National
    Park. DBH measurements were made at the beginning of the study and biomass increment
    was measured from a subset of trees. ANPP was estimated using regional species-specific
    allometric relationships for tree mass. Biomass, volume, and annual input of coarse
    woody detritus are also reported. Live biomass in the old-growth stands (32,600-47,100
    g/m2) is among the highest reported for temperate forests of eastern North America
    while ANPP is moderate (630-1,010 g/m2/yr). ANPP in the younger stand was higher
    (1,180-1,310 g/m2/yr). In comparison with forests worldwide, inputs of coarse woody
    debris is moderate. Revision Notes: Previously reported field collection dates have
    been corrected in the NPP file. Biomass and ANPP values were converted from Mg/ha
    and Mg/ha/yr to g/m2 and g/m2/yr, respectively, consistent with units in other files
    in the NPP collection. Please see the Data Set Revisions section of this document
    for detailed information. ",nt"owner_org": "d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed",nt"extras":
