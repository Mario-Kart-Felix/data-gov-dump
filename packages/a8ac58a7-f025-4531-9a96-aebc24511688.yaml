    NASA's mission to research and develop new aeronautical concepts because it allows
    for verification of simulated and wind-tunnel experiments and exposes previously
    unforeseen design problems. Video is an invaluable tool for flight-testing, allowing
    the collection of a wealth of information such as craft position, speed, health,
    as well as tracking different phases of flight, capturing events, extracting performance
    figures, and documenting historical flights.  For several cases of interest (high-speed/high-altitude
    aircraft, lakebed remote landings, vehicle re-entry, smoke airflow traces, etc.)
    it is not feasible or physically possible to install external cameras close to the
    aircraft whose behavior is being filmed.  Long-range imaging equipment is typically
    used in these cases, but the captured footage is severely limited in quality by
    atmospheric effects, which are often the dominating source of image degradation,
    long before diffraction-related limitations occur.  In consequence, long-range imagery
    typically suffers from scintillation, blurring, poor spatial resolution, and low
    contrast.  Since these problems result from atmospheric conditions, they cannot
    be overcome by simply improving imaging hardware.  What is needed is a solution
    to combat atmospheric distortion.  In Phase I, EM Photonics demonstrated a signal
    processing technique based on initial research from Lawrence Livermore National
    Laboratory.  We modified and implemented this core algorithm and showed its ability
    to enhance imagery collected from the long-range imaging systems at NASA DFRC.  In
    Phase II, we will evolve and integrate the prototype components developed in Phase
    I and deliver an image enhancement device capable of running in real time to mitigate
    the image distortion present in data collected from NASA DFRC's long-range cameras.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
