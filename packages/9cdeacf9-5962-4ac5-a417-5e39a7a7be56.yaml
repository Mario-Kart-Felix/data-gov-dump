    storage capabilities have led to information overload in many applications, including
    on-line monitoring of spacecraft operations with time series data. Such datasets
    present new challenges in data analysis, especially for implementation in memory-constrained
    DECUs.  Also, the traditional statistical methods break down partly because of the
    increase in the number of observations (measurements), but mostly due to an increase
    in the number of variables associated with each observation ("dimension of the
    data"). One of the problems with high-dimensional datasets is that not all the
    measured variables are "important" for understanding the underlying phenomena
    of interest. In addition to the computational cost, irrelevant features may also
    cause a reduction in the accuracy of some algorithms.  The first key issue we propose
    to address is that of data reduction techniques for onboard implementation of data-driven
    classification techniques in memory-constrained onboard processing units. Some of
    the classification techniques we intend to use with the above data-reduction techniques
    include, support vector machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), k-nearest
    neighbor (KNN), principal component Bayesian analysis (PCA). To improve the diagnostic
    accuracy and efficiency of the above classifiers, we will apply classifier fusion
    techniques such as AdaBoost, Error correcting output codes, Voting to find which
    architecture will enhance the accuracy and under what conditions. Finally we will
    investigate Dynamic Multiple Fault Diagnosis that can work with imperfect fault/anomaly
    detection tests. As part of this task, we will develop novel factorial hidden Markov
    model-based inferencing techniques such as Lagrangian relaxation and Viterbi decoding
    algorithms to solve this difficult combinatorial optimization problem, for on-board
    vehicle health monitoring and fault diagnosis.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
