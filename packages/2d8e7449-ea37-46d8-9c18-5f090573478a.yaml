  association map developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. It consists of
  a broad based inventory of soils and non soil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern
  on the landscape and that can be cartographic ally shown at the scale mapped. The
  soil maps for STATSGO are compiled by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps.
  Where more detailed soil survey maps are not available, data on geology, topography,
  vegetation, and climate are assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite
  (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas are studied, and the probable classification
  and extent of the soils are determined. Map unit composition for a STATSGO map is
  determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding
  the data statistically to characterize the whole map unit. This data set consists
  of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data
  are collected in 1- by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged and distributed
  as statewide coverages. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the Map Unit
  Interpretations Record relational data base which gives the proportionate extent
  of the component soils and their properties. These data are certified as a part
  of the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) data base. The original mapping scale was
  1: 250,000.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\": \"responsible-party\",\n\t\t\"value\":

  The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service should be acknowledged
  as the data source in products derived from these data. STATSGO was designed primarily
  for regional, multi county, river basin, State, and multi state resource planning,
  management, and monitoring. STATSGO data are not detailed enough to make interpretations
  at a county level. This soil survey product is not designed for use as a primary
  regulatory tool in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference
  source. The use of these data is not restricted and may be interpreted by organizations,
  agencies, units of government, or others; however, they are responsible for its
  appropriate application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign
  to the Soil Conservation Service any authority for the decisions that they make.
  The Soil Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps for
  purposes related solely to state or local regulatory programs. When STATSGO data
  are overlayed with other data layers, such as land use data, caution must be used
  in generating statistics on the co-occurence of the land use data with the soil
  data. The composition of the STATSGO map unit can be characterized independently
  for the land use and for the soil component, but there are no data on their joint
  occurrence at a more detailed level. Analysis of the overlayed data should be on
  a map polygon basis. Additional political, watershed, or other boundaries may be
  intersected with the soil data. Although the composition of each political and watershed
  unit may be described in terms of the STATSGO map units, information is not available
  to assign the components to the boundary units with full accuracy. As with the land
  use categories, the analysis should be restricted to the classified components.
  The approximate minimum area delineated is 625 hectares (1,544 acres), which is
  represented on a 1:250,000-scale map by an area approximately 1 cm by 1 cm (0.4
  inch by 0.4 inch). Linear delineations are not less than 0.5 cm (0.2 inch) in width.
  The number of delineations per 1:250,000 quadrangle typically is 100 to 200, but
  may range up to 400. Delineations depict the dominant soils making up the landscape.
  Other dissimilar soils, too small to be delineated, are present within a delineation.
  Digital enlargements of these maps to scales greater than at which they were originally
  mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the
  small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The
  depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from them do not
  eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific
  sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended
  for planning purposes only. Attribute data for some data elements may be incomplete
  or missing. Where data are unavailable, a mask should be used to exclude the area
  from analysis. Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and
  users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.\", \"Access
