    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;rntThe understanding of the line
    emission from heavy ions is still incomplete and often inaccurate, resulting in
    missing or incorrect line assignments and missing or incorrect flux. This limits
    the utility both of spectral predictions and of space-based equipment used for observing
    the solar spectrum. An example of this is the 195 &amp;Aring; channel of TRACE,
    which is centered on the FeXII line. Recent changes in the atomic data used to model
    the spectral emission near 195 &amp;Aring; have dramatically (up to an order of
    magnitude) changed the temperature response of this channel. A similar situation
    is likely to recur for the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument, which
    is to be launched as part of the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Here the responses
    of the six iron line channels, centered on lines from FeIX, FeXII, FeXIV, FeXVI,
    FeXVIII, FeXX, FeXXIII, and FeXXIV, sensitively depend on the correct position and
    strength of neighboring lines that fall within the instrumental response. Current
    predictions from various theoretical models describing the emission covered by these
    channels are in disagreement, and definitive experimental observations at the level
    of detail needed for establishing an authoritative model are nonexistent. Given
    the impending launch of the Solar Dynamics Observatory, which is a key mission in
    the Heliophysics Research Program, a resolution of the spectral modeling issues
    by definitive laboratory measurements is not only timely but urgently needed. Here
    we propose to conduct the definitive laboratory measurements required for calibrating
    the temperature response of the six AIA iron channels. Our work will provide highly
    accurate wavelength and intensity information of all relevant lines falling into
    the wavelength bands of the six Fe channels. This will provide the data for producing
    the high-confidence spectral modeling codes needed for use in calibrating the response
    of each iron line channel as well as for the successful evaluation and utilization
    of the observational data from the six AIA iron line channels.&lt;/p&gt;rn",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
