  at four stations on Black Creek and one station on Harland Creek (reference site),
  Holmes County, Mississippi were evaluated using the Rapid Bioassessment Protocols
  (RBP) and the Sediment Quality Triad (SQT) in June 2000 in order to assess potential
  biological impacts of pesticides from agricultural runoff on downstream resources,
  with particular concern for Hillside National Wildlife Refuge (Hillside NWR). Black
  Creek passes through the Hillside NWR before discharging into the Yazoo River. Hillside
  NWR is managed as bottomland hardwood forest and wetland for the protection of fish
  and wildlife resources. The RBI scores from the habitat evaluations of the respective
  stations indicated that habitat quality was similar throughout the stream system,
  with all sites, even the reference station, showing evidence of erosion and sedimentation.
  Benthic macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages were also similar among stations
  and did not differ significantly from the reference. Most of the benthic and fish
  species present were categorized as tolerant or intermediately tolerant to pollution
  and generally adapted to live in sediment laden systems. Differences among sites
  were small for the benthic macroinvertebrates, but fish populations were ranked
  lower at Station 3 than at the other sites and the reference station. The SQT showed
  that sediment quality was good when based upon toxicity testing of solid-phase sediments,
  but reduced when toxicity of pore waters was evaluated. Toxicities elicited in the
  pore water were attributed to elevated concentrations of copper and manganese. No
  organic pesticides were detected in the sediments. Although there was concordance
  between the RBI and SQT, the SQT for both the solid-phase and porewater evaluation,
  demonstrated that sediment quality was reduced at several stations in comparison
  with the reference site. The SQT for the solid-phase sediments indicated that Station
  2 was impacted, and the SQT with porewater indicated that Stations 1, 2 and 3 had
  reduce quality. Although Cu and Mn in the pore water were elevated and contributed
  to the toxicity shown in the laboratory tests with pore water, potential impacts
  to downstream resources, particularly at Hillside NWR, are unlikely. Copper and
  Mn concentrations in the whole sediments appear to be within background levels and
  the elevated Mn in the pore water may be an artifact associated with sediment collection
  and manipulation. Sedimentation appears to be the most serious environmental problem
  in Black Creek, and sediment loads to the stream have the potential to impact benthic
  and fish populations, particularly in downstream areas with less gradient (such
  as at Hillside NWR) where sediments have the potential to accumulate.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
