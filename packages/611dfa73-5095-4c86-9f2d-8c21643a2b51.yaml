    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "This data set contains traverse measurements
    used to infer the mass balance of central parts of the ice sheet upslope from the
    traverse, and results from this work have been published in Thomas et al., [1998]
    and 2000, with comparisons of these results with those from repeat altimetry in
    Thomas et al. (2001). Ongoing projects using these data include: Collaboration with
    J. Bamber to increase the spatial resolution of our mass-balance estimates in order
    to identify causes for major imbalance in parts of southern Greenland, and use of
    the ice velocities to infer basal conditions along the traverse.nnDuring 1993-1997
    a line of stakes about 30 km apart was established completely around the ice sheet
    approximately along the 2000 m elevation contour except in the south west, where
    it was higher because of high mountains, nunataks, and crevasses [Thomas et al.,
    1998 and 2000]. Each station was precisely surveyed by GPS, with resurvey one or
    two years later, to yield estimates of ice velocity. Station locations were marked
    by aluminum poles approximately 2 meters long, inserted close to vertically into
    the snow surface to a depth of about 1 meter. A second and, in areas of very high
    accumulation, a third pole was added to the lower pole using connecting sections
    and hose clamps. At each station, a GPS receiver was set atop the lower pole, by
    attaching a short length of aluminum rod to the base of the receiver and inserting
    this into the marker pole. Most stations were installed and surveyed via Twin Otter
    aircraft, during brief (about 10 minute) stops for station installation, and GPS
    mounting etc. The GPS receivers were left to operate for a minimum of 40 minutes,
    and more commonly a few hours. Up to 10 stations were visited during a one-day flight
    from a nearby coastal station. The GPS data from each day were processed by a point-positioning
    analysis for the longest-occupied station, with differential solutions for the others
    relative to this. Errors on resulting horizontal locations were about +/- 2 cm for
    the longest-occupied station, increasing to about +/- 10 cm for the shortest occupancy,
    with vertical errors approximately double these values. Additional errors were introduced
    by tilting of the marker poles during the 1-2 year interim between surveys, increasing
    the uncertainty by perhaps 5 cm. Consequently, derived velocities are accurate to
    better than +/- 0.2 m/yr.nnThe data were acquired with support from NASA's Polar
    Research Program, and users requesting the data are asked to provide a brief description
    of their application of the data. This will help provide NASA with an assessment
    of the scientific benefits resulting from their support of such efforts.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
