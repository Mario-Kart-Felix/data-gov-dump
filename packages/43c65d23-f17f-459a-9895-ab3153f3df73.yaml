    Geological Survey, Eagle County, the Eagle River Water and Sanitation District,
    the Town of Eagle, the Town of Gypsum, and the Upper Eagle Regional Water Authority.
    This project was designed to evaluate potential land-development effects on groundwater
    and surface-water resources so that informed land-use and water management decisions
    can be made. This groundwater probability map and its associated probability maps
    was developed as follows: (1) A point data set of wells with groundwater quality
    and groundwater age data was overlaid with thematic layers of anthropogenic (related
    to human activities) and hydrogeologic data by using a geographic information system
    to assign each well values for depth to groundwater, distance to major streams and
    canals, distance to gypsum beds, precipitation, soils, and well depth. These data
    then were downloaded to a statistical software package for analysis by logistic
    regression. (2) Statistical models predicting the probability of elevated nitrate
    concentrations, the probability of unmixed young water (using chlorofluorocarbon-11
    concentrations and tritium activities), and the probability of elevated volatile
    organic compound concentrations were developed using logistic regression techniques.
    (3) The statistical models were entered into a GIS and the probability map was constructed.",nt"license_title":

    This probability map is designed to portray the likelihood of groundwater in the
    Eagle River watershed valley-fill aquifer to be affected by anthropogenic (related
    to human activities) contamination. This map does not show areas that are actually
    (currently) contaminated; rather, it shows the areas that have a high likelihood
    for being contaminated if volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were released to the
    environment in the terms of percent probability. Probability is a statistical measure
    of how likely an event will occur. Probability is not the same as certainty. A well
    in a high-probability area is not necessarily contaminated because contamination
    also can depend on the type of contaminant released, how much of that contaminant
    was released, and other factors not taken into account by the logistic regression
    models. Although the probability maps show predictions of detections as a percent
    probability, there is inherent uncertainty within these predictions that is not
    shown in the probability map. This probability map is intended to be a first approximation
    at developing a consistent rating method for the entire study area and may have
    several limitations for use at the site or field scale. The model and map does not
    account for local point sources of contaminants or features and processes that may
    promote focused recharge, preferential groundwater flow, or bypass mechanisms. Additional
    site-specific data are needed before site-specific decisions are made, such as the
    site-specific design of a wastewater-disposal system. The Eagle River watershed
    is rapidly being developed. As development activities continue, some variables such
    as surficial soils and irrigation networks may be altered through construction activities,
    which may have unpredictable effects on the groundwater probability ratings. This
    probability map should not be used at a scale any larger than 1:24,000, which is
    the scale of the SSURGO soils data. Probably the most appropriate scale to use this
    data set is 1:100,000, which would help take into account the combined inaccuracies
    of the input data sets used to develop this final data set.", "Access Constraints:
