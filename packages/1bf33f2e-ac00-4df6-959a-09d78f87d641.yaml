  acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of Salt Point map area, California. Backscatter
  data are provided as separate grids depending on mapping system or processing method.
  The raster data files are included in \"Backscatter8101_SaltPoint.zip\", which are
  accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreSaltPoint/data_catalog_OffshoreSaltPoint.html.
  The acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of Salt Point map area, California,
  was generated from backscatter data collected by California State University, Monterey
  Bay (CSUMB), and by Fugro Pelagos. Mapping was completed between 2007 and 2010,
  using a combination of 200-kHz and 400-kHz Reson 7125, and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam
  echosounders, as well as 468-kHz SEA SWATHPlus interferometric system. These mapping
  missions combined to collect backscatter data from about the 10-m isobath to beyond
  the 3-nautical-mile limit of California State Waters. Within the acoustic-backscatter
  imagery, brighter tones indicate higher backscatter intensity, and darker tones
  indicate lower backscatter intensity. The intensity represents a complex interaction
  between the acoustic pulse and the seafloor, as well as characteristics within the
  shallow subsurface, providing a general indication of seafloor texture and composition.
  Backscatter intensity depends on the acoustic source level; the frequency used to
  image the seafloor; the grazing angle; the composition and character of the seafloor,
  including grain size, water content, bulk density, and seafloor roughness; and some
  biological cover. Harder and rougher bottom types such as rocky outcrops or coarse
  sediment typically return stronger intensities (high backscatter, lighter tones),
  whereas softer bottom types such as fine sediment return weaker intensities (low
  backscatter, darker tones). These data are not intended for navigational purposes.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
