	"notes": "ABSTRACT: The original objectives of the long-term vegetation survey of Walker Branch Watershed in eastern Tennessee (WBW; Curlin and Nelson 1968) was to quantify the standing crop of vegetation through time including measures of tree\/plant size distribution, species composition, above-ground biomass, and chemical balance. Field studies of permanent vegetation plots using one sample design were conducted over a 30-year period (1967 to 1997), and observations continue with funding from the U.S. Department of Energy's Program for Ecosystem Research. This data set consists of long-term measurements of diameter at breast height (DBH) determined on randomly located permanent inventory plots within the 4 different vegetation types located on WBW in 1967.  In addition, the lignin to nitrogen content in leaves (g lignin \/ g N of leaf tissue) for species present in WBW was obtained from the literature. More information can be found at: http:\/\/walkerbranch.ornl.gov\/.  Funding for long-term data collection efforts on Walker Branch was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research (BER), as a part of the Program for Ecosystem Research (PER).",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
