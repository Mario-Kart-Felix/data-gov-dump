  Stutsman, Kidder, Bowman, Slope, Stark, Hettinger, Adams, Grant, Sioux and Morton.
  These datasets were updated using a combination of the available NAIP aerials, the
  DES aerials, and by car within the insets.nn10/22/12 - city streets were updated
  in Bismarck, Dickinson, Minot and Williston. GIS data from the city of Bismarck
  was used to update Bismarck, GIS data and 2012 aerial photography was used to update
  the city of Williston, Minotu2019s city map and the 2010 aerial photography from
  Ward County was used to update Minot, and 2011 aerial photography and Dickinsonu2019s
  \"working\" city map was used to update Dickinson. The counties updated were Williams,
  Burke, Bottineau, Mountrail, Ward, Wells, Eddy, Foster, Griggs, Steele, and Cass.
  At the time of this updated, approximately 50% of Stutsman and 50% of Traill Counties
  are updated. Williams, Bottineau, Ward, and Mountrail roads were inspected from
  the air and the 2009 NAIP photos were also used to assist the updates. The roads
  in Williams County were also recoded to match Williams County naming conventions.
  Williams County CADD map which is on the Williams county web site was used in updating
  the road names. In Ward County, the 2010 image from Ward County was used to assist
  in updating Ward County. The 2010 NAIP photos were used to update Wells, Eddy, Foster,
  Griggs and Steele Counties. Cass was updated with the assistance of the Cass County
  GIS layer and the 2011 Cass county imagery. nn10/3/2011 - County roads were edited
  in the cities of Fargo, West Fargo, Horace, Minot, Bismarck, Devils Lake, Grafton,
  Williston, Valley City, and Dickinson. Also, a part of Ward and Mchenry Counties
  was edited and the county of Renville has been updated. The business routes through
  Bismarck and Jamestown were also edited. nn5/9/2011 - Updated streets in Bismarck,
  Mandan, Jamestown, Dickinson, West Fargo ( not quite finished yet), and Valley City.
  Also, corrected the north - south roads in Township 144N Ranges 49 - 53 E, (in Traill
  County) nn10/5/10 - The original Roads_County data was maintained in two separate
  ArcInfo coverages and then combined each year and exported to the NDHUB infrastructure.
  \ These two coverages have now been combined into one SDE feature class and is being
  edited within the SDE environment.  The following changes have been made to feature
  class.nnDeleted all the A1 and A2 Fields so a person would have to hunt back and
  forth to find a road name.  Road names consist of the following fields: RTE_ID,
  STR_TYP, SUF_DIR, & LAN_DIR.  The CMC route numbers were moved from the A1_ prefixed
  fields to the CMC field to better track the CMC route. Created a County Highway
  field so we can enter the county road number. It consists of the counties name and
  number. This is still a work in progress. Created FS_RD_Number and FS_RD_Name fields
  to better track Forest Service roads. Created Bia-RD_Number and BIA_RD_Name fields
  to better track Bureau of Indian Affairs roads.nnThe following field changes are
  used for NDDOT specific processes: Created a service level field which is something
  that may be used in the future. Currently it contains how Walsh County prioritizes
  their roads.  Created a Through and Connecting Route field so we can so select routes
  through the towns and cities. This was created exclusively for the county base maps.
  \ Created an Inset Associated  field. This was created so the information in the
  rd_misc would come into the county routes. In the future, it is planned to be deleted.nn6/18/09
  - Updated county routes from aerial observation and photo interpretation using 2003,
  2005, 2006 NAIP photos and 2008 photography from Designs camera. Counties updated
  were Golden Valley, Billings, McKenzie, Dunn, Mercer, Oliver, McLean, Sheridan and
  Burleigh.  City streets were rectified in these counties using the 2003 NAIP photos.
  Observations were performed by Steven Nelson.nnn4/17/08 - Updated road surface types
  in NE. Rolette, Pierce, Benson, Towner, Ramsey, Cavalier, Pembina, Walsh, Grand
  Forks and Nelson from the 2006 aerial observations by Dewaine Olson nn2/13/07 -
  Updated via 2004 NAIP photos: Barnes, Cass, Eddy, Foster, Griggs, Kidder, Steele,
  Stutsman, Traill, Wells. Combined Misc Roads and County Roads. Blank fields mean
  unknown attribute. Use P_STREET_NAME for dynamic labeling. We are also in the process
  of removing all proposed roads. nn12/28/05 - Counties updated: Emmons, Logan, Mcintosh,
  Lamoure, Dickey, Ransom, Sargent, Richland, Divide, Williams, Burke, Mountrail,
  Ward, Renville, Bottineau, and Mchenry nnThis data came from the NDDOT's Mapping
  Section. The original data was digitized from hand scribed maps and registered to
  the 1:24000 USGS PLSS data. The digitized data is maintained in individual county
  tiles. These tiles were appended together to make a singe state wide coverage. It
  was then converted from a projection (NAD 1983 UTM Zone 14N) to a Geographic coordinate
  system.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\": \"bbox-east-long\",\n\t\t\"value\":
