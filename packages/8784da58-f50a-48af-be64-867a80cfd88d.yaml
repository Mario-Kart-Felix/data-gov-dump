    files (.dbf) are an extract of selectedn          geographic and cartographic information
    from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
    Encoding and Referencingn          (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents
    a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line
    shapefile isn          designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they
    can be combined to cover the entire nation.n          n          A tribal block
    group is a cluster of census tabulation blocks within a single tribal census tract
    delineated by American Indian tribal participants or then          Census Bureau
    for the purpose of presenting demographic data on their reservation and/or off-reservation
    trust land.  The tribal block groups are definedn          independently of the
    standard county-based block group delineation.  For federally recognized American
    Indian Tribes with reservations and/or off-reservationn          trust lands with
    a population less than 1,200, a single tribal block group is defined.  Qualifying
    reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands with an          population greater
    than 1,200 could define additional tribal block groups within their area without
    regard to the standard block group configuration.  Tribaln          block groups
    do not necessarily contain tabulation blocks always beginning with the same number
    and could contain seemingly duplicate block numbers.n          Tabulation block
    numbers are still assigned by using standard block groups, not the tribal block
    groups.  To better identify tribal block groups, the lettern          code range
    A through K (except I, which could be confused with a number 1) is used uniquely
    within each tribal census tract.n          n          The boundaries of tribal block
    groups and tribal census tracts are those delineated through the Tribal Statistical
    Areas Program (TSAP) for the 2010 Census.n        ",nt"license_title": "Creative
