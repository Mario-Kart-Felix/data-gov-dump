    & Ranging) 3x3 meter resolution bathymetric surface for an area of shallow seabed
    surrounding St. Thomas and St. John (STT/STJ)in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI).
    The image's horizontal coordinate system is NAD83 UTM 20 North, and depth values
    are in meters referenced to Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) heights. Fugro LADS, in
    collaboration with NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, the University of
    New Hampshire and the National Park Service, acquired bathymetry, relative seafloor
    reflectivity and hyperspectral imagery in STT/STJ on thirteen different sorties
    from 1/29/2011 to 2/28/2011. Hyperspectral data were acquired using a Hyspex VNIR-1600
    sensor. Bathymetry and reflectivity data were acquired using a LADS (Laser Airborne
    Depth Sounder) Mark II Airborne System from altitudes between 1,200 and 2,200ft
    at ground speeds between 140 and 210 knots. The 900 Hertz Nd: YAG (neodymium-doped
    yttrium aluminum garnet) laser (1064 nm) acquired 3x3 meter spot spacing and 200%
    seabed coverage. In total, 168.1 square kilometers of LiDAR were collected between
    0 m and 40 m in depth. Environmental factors such as wind strength and direction,
    cloud cover, water clarity and depth influenced the area of data acquisition on
    a daily basis. The data was processed using the LADS Mark II Ground System and data
    visualization, quality control and final products were created using CARIS HIPS
    and SIPS and CARIS BASE Editor. All users should individually evaluate the suitability
    of this data according to their own needs and standards.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
