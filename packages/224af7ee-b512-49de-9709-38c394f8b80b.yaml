    a long-term database containing water level measurements and derived tidal data
    for coastal waters of the United States and U.S. territories. These data allow for
    the determination and maintenance of vertical reference datums used for surveying
    and mapping, coastal construction, waterborne commerce, water level regulation,
    marine boundary determination, and tide prediction, and for the determination of
    long-term water level variations (e.g. trends). The data also supports other U.S.
    government programs, including the National Weather Service (NWS) Tsunami Warning
    System, the NWS storm surge monitoring programs, and the NOAA Climate and Global
    Change Program. The database contains an extended series of water level measurements
    recorded at different tide observation stations. These data are processed to generate
    a number of products, including monthly and yearly averages for mean tide level,
    mean sea level, diurnal tide level, mean high and low water, mean range, diurnal
    mean range, monthly extremes for high and low waters, and frequency and duration
    of inundations (the number of times and length of time at which the water level
    has equaled or exceeded a specific elevation for a period of analysis). Data are
    compiled for coastal waters of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
    and U.S. territories in the Pacific region. Water levels are monitored from a network
    of over 200 permanent, continuously operating tide observation stations and from
    numerous stations operated for short-term and long-term projects. Water level measurements
    are compiled for a variety of observation periods, depending upon the location.
    For some tide observation stations, records date back to the late 1800s. Observed
    water level values are compiled primarily at six minute increments. In addition,
    some stations provide real-time data for planning and emergency situations. The
    observed values are processed to generate mean and extreme values for different
    temporal intervals, as noted above. The data consist simply of elevations of water,
    in feet, observed at specific geographic locations and temporal periods. All water
    level measurements are referenced to staff '0' and can be referenced to other datums,
    such as the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88). Recent data are recorded
    to the hundredth of a foot; data collected prior to the mid-1960s are recorded to
    the tenth of a foot. The foundation of the water level database is the National
    Water Level Observation Network (NWLON), a system of long-term operating tide stations
    maintained by NOS. Data also are obtained through short-term and long-term cooperative
    projects with other federal, state, and local agencies and governments to accomplish
    mutual goals in water level measurement. For example, tide stations are operated
    temporarily for marine boundary determination and hydrographic survey projects.
    NOS also maintains several cooperative stations with foreign governments for the
    Climate and Global Change Program. Indices of tide stations maintained by NOS are
    available which include for each station the latitude, longitude, dates of observations,
    bench mark sheet publication date, and tidal epoch. NOS also issues tidal bench
    mark sheets upon completion of a data collection series or as needed for long-term
    NWLON stations. Tidal bench mark sheets provide location descriptions and vertical
    elevations referenced to tidal datums of the station bench marks. A table of tidal
    datums and the 1929 NGVD, when available, are referenced to the station reference
    datum. A number of products are issued monthly and annually, for free or on a cost
    recovery basis. The products are distributed on either hard copy, floppy disk, CD,
    or over the web and include the following: o Tide Observation Station Lists o Tides,
    6-Minute Heights o Tides, Hourly Heights of Tides, Times and Heights of High and
    Low Waters o Tides, Monthly Mean Summaries o Tidal Bench Mark Sheets with Tidal
    Datums o Frequency and Duration Analysis of Tidal Water Levels o Daily Mean Sea
    Level CO-OPS also provides a number of information services for which it charges
    a fee, based on a professional service rate of $30.00 per hour. The services include
    the following: o Computation of bench mark elevations and tidal datums. o Computation
    of the NAVD88 referenced to other tidal datums. o Computation of historical tidal
    datums. o Providing tidal zoning for hydrographic projects. o Preparing and reviewing
    certified documents for court use. o Retrieval of requested historical data sets
    not provided over the web. Water level data are also used to calculate inundation
    statistics. CO-OPSu0092 Inundation Analysis Tool can be used to determine the frequency
    (or the occurrence of high waters for different elevations above a specified threshold)
    and duration (or the amount of time that the specified location is inundated by
    water) of observed high waters (tides). Statistical output from these analyses can
    be useful in planning marsh restoration activities. Additionally, the analyses have
    broader applications for the coastal engineering and mapping community, such as,
    ecosystem management and regional climate change. Since these statistical outputs
    are station specific, use for evaluating surrounding areas may be limited. The inundation
    analysis tool provides summary statistics, which includes the number of occurrences
    of inundation above the threshold (events) and length of duration of inundation
    of each events above the threshold elevation for a specified time period. In addition
    to summary statistics, graphical outputs are provided using various plots.",nt"license_title":

    along the outer coast are more accurate than those for stations farther inland;
    along a river, or in a bay or other estuary. Inland stations tend to have a stronger
    non-tidal influence; that is, they are more susceptible to the effects of wind and
    other meteorological effects than stations along the outer coast. An example of
    an inland station which is difficult to predict is Baltimore, Maryland. This station
    is located at the northern end of Chesapeake Bay. Winds which blow along the length
    of the bay have been known to cause water levels to be 1-2 feet above or below the
    predicted tides.Stations in relatively shallow water, or with a small tidal range,
    are also highly susceptible to meteorological effects and thus difficult to accurately
    predict. At these stations, short-term weather events can completely mask the astronomical
    tides. Many of the stations along the western Gulf of Mexico fall into this category.
    An example is Galveston, Texas. This station is in a bay which is relatively shallow
    and has a small opening to the sea. At this station it is possible for meteorological
    events to delay or accelerate the arrival of the predicted tides by an hour or more."]"nt},nt{ntt"key":
