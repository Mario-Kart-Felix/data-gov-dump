    on fish and benthic communities within the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary
    (FGBNMS). Surveys will employ diving, technical diving, ROV, and hydroacoustics
    technologies for a comprehensive assessment of the fish and benthic habitat communities
    of the East and West Bank. The FGBNMS represents the northernmost tropical western
    Atlantic coral reef on the continental shelf and support the most highly developed
    offshore hard bank community in the region. The complexity of habitats supports
    a diverse assemblage of organisms including approximately 250 species of fish, 23
    species of coral, and 80 species of algae in addition to large sponge communities.
    Understanding and monitoring these resources is critical to both sanctuary inventory
    and management activities. During the course of the sanctuary's management plan
    review process, the impact of fishing was identified as a priority issue, and the
    concept of a research only area was suggested. The purpose of this project will
    be to provide baseline data for all benthic habitats and communities.",nt"license_title":
