  location where sworn officers of a law enforcement agency are regularly based or
  stationed. Law enforcement agencies \"are publicly funded and employ at least one
  full-time or part-time sworn officer with general arrest powers\". This is the definition
  used by the US Department of Justice - Bureau of Justice Statistics (DOJ-BJS) for
  their Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey. Although
  LEMAS only includes non Federal Agencies, this dataset includes locations for federal,
  state, local, and special jurisdiction law enforcement agencies. Law enforcement
  agencies include, but are not limited to, municipal police, county sheriffs, state
  police, school police, park police, railroad police, federal law enforcement agencies,
  departments within non law enforcement federal agencies charged with law enforcement
  (e.g., US Postal Inspectors), and cross jurisdictional authorities (e.g., Port Authority
  Police). In general, the requirements and training for becoming a sworn law enforcement
  officer are set by each state. Law Enforcement agencies themselves are not chartered
  or licensed by their state. County, city, and other government authorities within
  each state are usually empowered by their state law to setup or disband Law Enforcement
  agencies. Generally, sworn Law Enforcement officers must report which agency they
  are employed by to the state. Although TGS's intention is to only include locations
  associated with agencies that meet the above definition, TGS has discovered a few
  locations that are associated with agencies that are not publicly funded. TGS is
  deleting these locations as we become aware of them, but some probably still exist
  in this dataset. Personal homes, administrative offices and temporary locations
  are intended to be excluded from this dataset, but a few may be included. Personal
  homes of constables may exist due to fact that many constables work out of their
  home. FBI entites are intended to be excluded from this dataset, but a few may be
  included. Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate
  consistent database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut
  or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character
  to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness
  of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. Based upon this attribute,
