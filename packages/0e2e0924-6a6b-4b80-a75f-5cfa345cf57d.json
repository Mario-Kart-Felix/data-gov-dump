	"notes": "The number of bald eagle nesting territories along Hood Canal in Washington State have increased from 3 known occupied territories in 1980 to 35 in 2000. Historically, the average productivity and success rate of eagles nesting in the Hood Canal territories was below the overall Washington State productivity and success rate, and they fluctuated dramatically. The Hood Canal eagle territories have, however, achieved an average of 0.96 young per occupied territory and success rate of 64.2 % over the past 5 years. These levels are close to the recovery objectives in the Pacific Bald Eagle Recovery Plan. A study was initiated in 1992 to evaluate if contaminants were a possible cause of the lower productivity. In 1992 and 1993, fresh eggs were collected from eight Hood Canal bald eagle territories. Nests with a history of the highest failure rates were selected for sampling. Between 1994 and 1997, only addled eggs were collected from the Hood Canal area nests. Addled eggs were also collected from 5 bald eagle nesting territories outside the Hood Canal area for comparison. Total PCB concentrations measured in the eggs collected from the Hood Canal territories exceeded threshold levels identified for normal bald eagle reproduction. Concentrations of PCBs in bald eagle eggs from Hood Canal declined from 1992 to 1997. The total dioxin-like activity measured in the eggs of bald eagles was above the threshold for adverse effects on reproduction. Overall, the eggs collected from Hood Canal territories during 1992 and 1993 had higher total PCB concentrations and total dioxin-like potency than the other eggs collected for this study. Non-ortho and mono-ortho planar PCBs measured in the bald eagle eggs accounted for the majority of the dioxin-like toxicity. Only two eggs collected during the study (one from Hood Canal and one outside Hood Canal) exceeded the reproductive threshold limit for p,p\u2019-DDE. Concentrations of mercury, selenium and arsenic were below levels of concern in the five eggs where they were analyzed. Detectable levels of PCBs and p,p\u2019-DDE were present in blood samples. Concentrations of PCBs and dioxin-like compounds measured in the fish and sediment samples from Hood Canal were not great enough to account for the elevated amounts found in bald eagles from this area. Our sample sizes for the evaluation of the source of PCBs and other dioxin-like contaminants found in bald eagles and their eggs were extremely small and definite conclusions cannot be made. However, our findings indicate that the contaminant pathway to the bald eagles in Hood Canal was likely from food items other than fish (i.e. birds or marine mammals). At this time additional contaminant studies on the Hood Canal bald eagles are not planned; however, productivity monitoring needs to be continued. If the productivity levels begin to fluctuate dramatically, or if they are consistently lower than statewide values, we recommend re-initiating a contaminants study. Since PCBs accounted for the greatest proportion of the total dioxin-like potency in the eggs of bald eagles from Hood Canal, we recommend that measurement of total PCBs would be sufficient to track the greatest chemical threat identified to the Hood Canal eagles if a contaminants monitoring effort were to resume.",
