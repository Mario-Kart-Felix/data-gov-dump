    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    (PITEX) has been an on-going research effort conducted over severalrnyears. PITEX
    has developed and applied a model-based diagnostic system for the main propulsion
    system of the X-34rnreusable launch vehicle, a space-launch technology demonstrator.
    The application was simulation-based using detailed models of the propulsion subsystem
    to generate nominal and failure scenarios during captive carry, which is the most
    safety-critical portion of the X-34 flight. Since no system-level testing of the
    X-34 Main Propulsion System (MPS) was performed, these simulated data were used
    to verify and validate the software system. Advanced diagnostic and signal processing
    algorithms were developed and tested in real-time on flight-like hardware. In an
    attempt to expose potential performance problems, these PITEX algorithms were subject
    to numerous real-world effects in the simulated data including noise, sensor resolution,
    command/valve talkback information, and nominal build variations. The current research
    has demonstrated the potential benefits of model-based diagnostics, defined the
    performance metrics required to evaluate the diagnostic system, and studied the
    impact of real-world challenges encountered when monitoringrnpropulsion subsystems.",nt"owner_org":
