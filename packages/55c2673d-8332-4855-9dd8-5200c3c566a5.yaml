    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The nesting population of greater sandhill
    cranes on Malheur  National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon had declined from 236 pairs
    in  1971 to 181 pairs in 1986 when predator control began. The population has continued
    to decline to 168 pairs in 1989. Some of the decline is attributed to lost habitat
    on Mud, Malheur and  Barney Lakes due to record high lake levels (14 pairs). Losses
    on Mud, Malheur, and Harney lakes had already taken place by 1986 but could not
    be verified until a comprehensive pair count was done in 1988. The remainder of
    the decline is attributed to the low recruitment of young into the population during
    the years 1971 through 1985. In 1990, a total of 177 crane pairs were counted on
    the refuge. This represents the first increase documented for the refuge crane population
    since 1972. We believe the increase is a direct result of the predator control program.
    Cranes produced during the first couple of years of the control effort became old
    enough to breed. In comparison to 1989, twenty-two additional active territories
    were identified this year. Eight of these sites were inactive in 1989 but had been
    active in previous years. Fourteen territories which had been active in 1989 were
    inactive this year. These losses and gains in territory activity can be attributed
    to shifting or territory sites, pair mortality, and pair recruitment. At least nine
    new pairs began nesting in 1990. In 1990, 156 coyotes were removed by the following
    methods: aerial gunning (8 percent), calling and shooting (28 percent), trapping
    and snares (44 percent), and denning (18 percent). An estimated 35 ravens were removed
    using 35 dozen eggs injected with DRC-1339 and an additional 8 ravens were shot.
    Nine raccoons were taken by trapping plus ten by shooting, for a total of 19. Sandhill
    cranes experienced a fair production year in 1990. Overall sandhill crane hatching
    success was 83% in 1990. This exceeds our control program goal of 75%, and is the
    highest nesting success ever recorded for the Malheur crane flock. Predators took
    only 8% of the nests this year (raven - 3%, raccoon -3%, coyote - 0%, and unidentified
    predators - 2%). Crane colts were counted on 7 September in the Double-O and Blitzen
    Valley using ADC's supercub aircraft. This aerial data was supplemented with ground
    counts in the Blitzen Valley. A total of 22 colts were counted on the refuge in
    September 1990. During a visit to the Double-O in mid March 1991, biologist Ivey
    observed six colts accompanied by parents. Only two colts were counted from this
    area during the September survey. Therefore, at least 26 colts were produced in
    1990. This should be considered a minimum number, since dry conditions and poor
    grain crops forced many cranes to migrate south before the September counts were
    completed.",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
