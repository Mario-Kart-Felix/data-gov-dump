  Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
  reef ecosystems, from 15 April - 7 May 2009, reef fish assessment surveys were conducted,
  as a part of Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA), during the Pacific Reef Assessment
  and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruise HI0903 in the Marianas Archipelago at biennial
  intervals by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands
  Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). During the cruise, 21 REA sites were surveyed
  at Pagan Island in the Marianas Archipelago. At the specific REA sites, fish biologists
  along with coral biologists, algal biologists and marine invertebrate zoologist
  entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~300 m2) and high degree of taxonomic
  resolution REA survey to assess and monitor species composition, abundance, percent
  cover, size distribution, diversity, and general health of fish, corals, macro-invertebrates,
  and algae in shallow-water (< 35 m) habitats. Reef fish assessment surveys were
  focused on cataloging the diversity (species richness), abundance (numeric density
  [# fish 100 m-2] and biomass density [kg 100 m-2]) of diurnally active reef fish
  assemblages. Three complementary noninvasive underwater survey methods were used,
  including belt-transect, stationary point count, and roving-diver surveys. For all
  methods, fish were identified at the species level, when possible, and assigned
  to a size bin ranging from 1 to 200 cm based on a visual estimate of total fish
  length. Belt-transect (BLT) surveys were used to quantify the entire diurnal fish
  community (all size classes). In belt-transect surveys, two fish biologists swam
  side-by-side along three consecutively-placed, 25m transect lines. The BLT team
  swam each transect two times. During the initial swim-out, each fish diver recorded
  all fish larger than 20 cm observed within a 4-m wide belt perpendicular to their
  respective side of the transect (200 m2 area per line, 100 m2 per diver). On the
  return swim, each fish diver recorded all fish less than 20 cm observed within a
  2-m wide belt (100 m2 area per line, 50 m2 per diver). The survey of large fish
  took approximately 5 min to complete while the survey of smaller fish took about
  10 min to complete. All reef-associated fish, including those in the water column
  (including planktivores), were counted. Any coastal pelagic species (e.g., clupeids
  [sardines], belonids [beakfish], antherinids [silversides]) seen near the surface
  were not recorded. The stationary point count (SPC) method were used to quantify
  larger, more mobile reef fish species that can be missed on belt-transect surveys.
  In stationary point count survey, a fish biologist swam approximately 15 m away
  from a transect line concurrently being surveyed by the other two BLT fish biologists.
  The SPC biologist then recorded all fish greater than 25 cm in length that passed
  within a visually estimated 20-m diameter cylinder centered on the diver's fixed
  position (10-m radius, total area = 314 m2). The survey time for each stationary
  point count survey was 5 min and a total of four stationary point count surveys
  were conducted at each REA site. Roving-diver surveys were followed belt-transect
  and stationary point count surveys. As diver bottom time permitted, the fish assessment
  team conducted random swim surveys throughout the REA site area, recording, to the
  species level or the lowest recognizable taxon, the presence of reef fish not encountered
  during previous methods.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\":
