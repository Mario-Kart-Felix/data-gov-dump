    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Being relatively new to the field, electromechanical
    actuators in aerospace applications lack the knowledge base compared to ones accumulated
    for the other actuator types, especially when it comes to fault detection and characterization.
    Lack of health monitoring data from fielded systems and prohibitive costs of carrying
    out real flight tests push for the need of building system models and designing
    affordable but realistic experimental setups. This paper presents our approach to
    accomplish a comprehensive test environment equipped with fault injection and data
    collection capabilities. Efforts also include development of multiple models for
    EMA operations, both in nominal and fault conditions that can be used along with
    measurement data to generate effective diagnostic and prognostic estimates. A detailed
    description has been provided about how various failure modes are inserted in the
    test environment and corresponding data is collected to verify the physics based
    models under these failure modes that have been developed in parallel. A design
    of experiment study has been included to outline the details of experimental data
    collection. Furthermore, some ideas about how experimental results can be extended
    to real flight environments through actual flight tests and using real flight data
    have been presented. Finally, the roadmap leading from this effort towards developing
    successful prognostic algorithms for electromechanical actuators is discussed.*",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
