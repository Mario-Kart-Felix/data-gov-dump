    the Landsat commercialization contract was signed between the Department of Commerce
    and the Earth Observation Satellite Company (EOSAT) on September 27, 1985, all Landsat
    activities were handled by the Federal government. After that date all Landsat commercial
    rights became the property of EOSAT. EOSAT will still retain exclusive sales rights
    to all Thematic Mapper (TM) data until July 1994, at which time all Landsat data
    over ten years old will become available from the National Archive at the EROS Data
    Center (EDC). The first satellite in the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS)
    program was launched July 23, 1972 and designated ERTS 1. In 1975 the program was
    re-designated as the Landsat program to emphasize its primary area of interest,
    land resources. The mission of Landsat is to provide for repetitive acquisition
    of high resolution multispectral data of the earth's surface on a global basis.
    The complete Landsat system consists of an observation platform in a near-polar
    Earth orbit and ground installations to receive, process and distribute the data
    provided by the sensors carried on the satellite. The platform carries two remote
    sensor systems and a data relay system along with attitude-control and orbit-adjust
    subsystems, power supply, transmitters to send the data to ground receiving stations
    and receivers for ground station commands. The Landsat satellites are in a sun-synchronous,
    near polar orbit with a ground swath extending 185 km (115 miles) in both directions.
    Landsat 4 and 5 are inclined 98 degrees, have an orbital cycle of 16 days and an
    equatorial crossing of 9:45AM local time. The altitude of the satellites is 705
    km (437 miles) for both Landsats 4 and 5. The Landsat platforms operate from a sun-synchronous,
    near polar orbit imaging the same 185 km (115 miles) ground swath every 16 days.
    Thematic Mapper (TM) data are received directly from Landsats 4 and 5 by a network
    of 15 worldwide ground stations. Also, data are transmitted via a Tracking and Data
    Relay Satellite (TDRS) to its ground terminal at White Sands, New Mexico and then
    relayed via a domestic communications satellite (DOMSAT) to the EOSAT data processing
    facility in Lanham, Maryland. TM data are processed for radiometric and geometric
    corrections at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).",nt"license_title":
