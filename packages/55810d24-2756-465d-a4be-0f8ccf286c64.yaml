    is the result of a multifaceted effort described below. The National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Biogeography Branch, in consultation with NOAA's
    Office of Response and Restoration (OR&R) and other local and regional experts,
    is conducting an ecological characterization of the marine ecosystem around Vieques
    Island, Puerto Rico. The assessment will support effective management and conservation
    of marine resources in Vieques as a whole. To date a spatially comprehensive assessment
    of coral reef and hardbottom habitat around Vieques has been lacking. To fill this
    gap, the Biogeography Branch is expanding long term monitoring efforts to Vieques
    to collect detailed information about the benthic habitats, fish, and invertebrate
    communities. Spatially comprehensive information on reefs and hardbottom is vital
    to future management of the marine resources around Vieques. The collected data
    will be used to quantify the abundance and spatial distribution of fish, corals,
    and benthic invertebrates on hardbottom habitats around Vieques. Further, with regular
    monitoring, changes in the composition and condition of Vieques reefs over time
    can be detected. Data is collected using established protocols and monitoring efforts
    consistent with NOAA's National Coral Reef Monitoring Program and the Biogeography
    Branch's long-term monitoring efforts in southwest Puerto Rico and the US Virgin
    Islands since 2000 and 2001, respectively. The intent of this work is: 1) To spatially
    characterize and monitor the distribution, abundance, and size of both reef fishes
    and macro-invertebrates (conch, lobster, Diadema); 2) To relate this information
    to in-situ data collected on associated benthic composition parameters; and 3) To
    use this information to establish the knowledge base necessary for enacting management
    decisions in a spatial setting. It is critical, with recent changes in land and
    maritime use in Vieques (i.e., transfer of former Navy lands to the Fish and Wildlife
    Service, the Municipality in Vieques, and the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust) that
    action is taken now to accurately describe and characterize the fish/macro-invertebrate
    populations in these areas. To quantify patterns of spatial distribution and make
    meaningful interpretations, we must first have knowledge of the underlying variables
    determining species distribution. The basis for this work, is the nearshore benthic
    habitats maps (less than 100 ft depth) created by NOAA's Biogeography Program in
    2001 and NOS' bathymetry models. Using ArcView GIS software, the digitized habitat
    maps are used to select reef/hardbottom habitat that is further stratified by proximity
    to former land use and geographic side of the island (i.e., north vs. south) to
    select sampling stations. Sites are randomly selected within these strata to ensure
    coverage of the entire study region and not just a particular reef. At each site,
    fish, macro-invertebrates, and benthic composition information is then quantified
    following standardized protocols. By relating the data collected in the field back
    to the habitat maps and bathymetric models, the Biogeography Branch is able to model
    and map species level and community level information. These protocols are standardized
    throughout the US Caribbean to enable quantification and comparison of reef fish
    abundance and distribution trends between Vieques and the other locations. Knowledge
    of the current status of fish/macro-invertebrate communities coupled with longer
    term monitoring will enable evaluation of management efficacy, thus it is essential
    to future management actions.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
