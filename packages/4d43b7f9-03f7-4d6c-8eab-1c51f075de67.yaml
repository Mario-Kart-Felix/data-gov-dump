    of lead has been documented in waterfowl in Alaska. In spectacled eiders (Somateria
    fischeri) and long-tailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis), lead exposure has been demonstrated
    on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (Y-K Delta) at levels that have negative population
    effects (Franson et al. 1995, Flint et al. 1997, Flint and Grand 1997, Flint and
    Herzog 1999). Additionally, Stellers eiders (Polysticta stelleri) breeding near
    Barrow on the North Slope showed high levels and rates of exposure (Trust et al.
    1997; A. Matz, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, unpubl. data), and 11 percent of
    long-tailed ducks captured northeast of Teshukpuk Lake on the North Slope in 1980
    had lead shot in their gizzards (Taylor 1986). Breeding populations of Steller's
    and spectacled eiders in Alaska have declined dramatically and both are listed as
    threatened species. King eiders (S. spectabilis), common eiders (S. mollissima)
    and long-tailed ducks are listed as species of concern by the Alaska Natural Heritage
    Program. Common eider population trend information is sparse, but a migration study
    at Barrow suggests a large (50 percent) decline from 1976 to 1994. The presumed
    source for avian exposure above background is ingestion of lead shot, which waterfowl
    consume either intentionally or accidentally while feeding in wetlands where hunting
    has occurred. Lead shot settles slowly, with some shot potentially available more
    than three years after deposition (Flint 1998; P. Flint, unpubl. data). Alternatively,
    birds could be exposed to "background" lead associated with naturally occurring
    sediment concentrations or dispersed sources such as emissions from combustion of
    automotive gasoline or industrial processing. While use of leaded gasoline has declined
    overall in the Northern Hemisphere since the 1970s, combustion of leaded gasoline
    from Europe and Asia is still the major source of atmospheric lead in the Arctic
    (Dietz et al. 1998, Barrie et al. 1997). Baseline lead levels in the Arctic are
    typically low, however, except near point sources such as smelters, mining sites,
    and military installations such as Distant Early Warning (DEW) sites (e.g., Braune
    et al. 1999). Avian exposure to lead from shot can be determined using radiographs
    or dissection, if shot are present within the bird. However, lead isotope analysis
    can identify sources even when no lead shot are found. Ratios of lead isotopes (e.g.,
    206 Pb /207Pb) can distinguish between different environmental sources, such as
    gasoline, natural deposits, or lead shot (Scheuhammer and Templeton 1998, Gelinas
    and Schmit 1997, Blais 1996). This technique has been used to identify lead shot
    as the major source of exposure for loons, waterfowl, and eagles in Canada (Scheuhammer
    and Templeton 1998). Our study goals were to identify the isotopic signatures of
    potential sources of lead exposure for nesting eiders and long-tailed ducks on the
    Y-K Delta and along the North Slope, and to examine variation in lead isotopic signatures
    over a range of blood lead concentrations in the same species. We were also interested
    in determining if the standard clinical blood lead threshold of 0.2 ppm (Friend
    1985) was applicable to eiders and other waterfowl in Alaska, because nesting Y-K
    Delta spectacled eider blood lead concentrations did not have an expected specific
    breakpoint at 0.2 ppm between background concentrations and elevated concentrations.
    Lack of a definitive breakpoint suggested that the level above which eiders should
    be considered "poisoned" by or even "exposed" to lead above background was unclear,
    based on standard blood lead residue analyses. We therefore compared blood isotopic
    signatures to those from reference matrices (sediments and shot) to define blood
    concentrations indicative of exposure to lead shot.",nt"license_title": "License
