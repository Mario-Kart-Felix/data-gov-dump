  a long-term database containing water level measurements and derived tidal data
  for coastal waters of the United States and U.S. territories. These data allow for
  the determination and maintenance of vertical reference datums used for surveying
  and mapping, coastal construction, waterborne commerce, water level regulation,
  marine boundary determination, and tide prediction, and for the determination of
  long-term water level variations (e.g. trends). The data also supports other U.S.
  government programs, including the National Weather Service (NWS) Tsunami Warning
  System, the NWS storm surge monitoring programs, and the NOAA Climate and Global
  Change Program. The database contains an extended series of water level measurements
  recorded at different tide observation stations. These data are processed to generate
  a number of products, including monthly and yearly averages for mean tide level,
  mean sea level, diurnal tide level, mean high and low water, mean range, diurnal
  mean range, monthly extremes for high and low waters, and frequency and duration
  of inundations (the number of times and length of time at which the water level
  has equaled or exceeded a specific elevation for a period of analysis). Data are
  compiled for coastal waters of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
  and U.S. territories in the Pacific region. Water levels are monitored from a network
  of over 200 permanent, continuously operating tide observation stations and from
  numerous stations operated for short-term and long-term projects. Water level measurements
  are compiled for a variety of observation periods, depending upon the location.
  For some tide observation stations, records date back to the late 1800s. Observed
  water level values are compiled primarily at six minute increments. In addition,
  some stations provide real-time data for planning and emergency situations. The
  observed values are processed to generate mean and extreme values for different
  temporal intervals, as noted above. The data consist simply of elevations of water,
  in feet, observed at specific geographic locations and temporal periods. All water
  level measurements are referenced to staff '0' and can be referenced to other datums,
  such as the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88). Recent data are recorded
  to the hundredth of a foot; data collected prior to the mid-1960s are recorded to
  the tenth of a foot. The foundation of the water level database is the National
  Water Level Observation Network (NWLON), a system of long-term operating tide stations
  maintained by NOS. Data also are obtained through short-term and long-term cooperative
  projects with other federal, state, and local agencies and governments to accomplish
  mutual goals in water level measurement. For example, tide stations are operated
  temporarily for marine boundary determination and hydrographic survey projects.
  NOS also maintains several cooperative stations with foreign governments for the
  Climate and Global Change Program. Indices of tide stations maintained by NOS are
  available which include for each station the latitude, longitude, dates of observations,
  bench mark sheet publication date, and tidal epoch. NOS also issues tidal bench
  mark sheets upon completion of a data collection series or as needed for long-term
  NWLON stations. Tidal bench mark sheets provide location descriptions and vertical
  elevations referenced to tidal datums of the station bench marks. A table of tidal
  datums and the 1929 NGVD, when available, are referenced to the station reference
  datum. A number of products are issued monthly and annually, for free or on a cost
  recovery basis. The products are distributed on either hard copy, floppy disk, CD,
  or over the web and include the following: o Tide Observation Station Lists o Tides,
  6-Minute Heights o Tides, Hourly Heights of Tides, Times and Heights of High and
  Low Waters o Tides, Monthly Mean Summaries o Tidal Bench Mark Sheets with Tidal
  Datums o Frequency and Duration Analysis of Tidal Water Levels o Daily Mean Sea

  events will have on the tides.In general, predictions for stations along the outer
  coast are more accurate than those for stations farther inland; along a river, or
  in a bay or other estuary. Inland stations tend to have a stronger non-tidal influence;
  that is, they are more susceptible to the effects of wind and other meteorological
  effects than stations along the outer coast. An example of an inland station which
  is difficult to predict is Baltimore, Maryland. This station is located at the northern
  end of Chesapeake Bay. Winds which blow along the length of the bay have been known
  to cause water levels to be 1-2 feet above or below the predicted tides.Stations
  in relatively shallow water, or with a small tidal range, are also highly susceptible
  to meteorological effects and thus difficult to accurately predict. At these stations,
  short-term weather events can completely mask the astronomical tides. Many of the
  stations along the western Gulf of Mexico fall into this category. An example is
  Galveston, Texas. This station is in a bay which is relatively shallow and has a
  small opening to the sea. At this station it is possible for meteorological events
  to delay or accelerate the arrival of the predicted tides by an hour or more.\"]\"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"key\":
