    service area boundaries in Arkansas According to the National Emergency Number Association
    (NENA), a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) is a facility equipped and staffed
    to receive 9-1-1 calls. The service area is the geographic area within which a 911
    call placed using a landline is answered at the associated PSAP. This dataset only
    includes primary PSAPs. Secondary PSAPs, backup PSAPs, and wireless PSAPs have been
    excluded from this dataset. Primary PSAPs receive calls directly, whereas secondary
    PSAPs receive calls that have been transferred by a primary PSAP. Backup PSAPs provide
    service in cases where another PSAP is inoperable. Most military bases have their
    own emergency telephone systems. To connect to such system from within a military
    base it may be necessary to dial a number other than 9 1 1. Due to the sensitive
    nature of military installations, TGS did not actively research these systems. If
    civilian authorities in surrounding areas volunteered information about these systems
    or if adding a military PSAP was necessary to fill a hole in civilian provided data,
    TGS included it in this dataset. Otherwise military installations are depicted as
    being covered by one or more adjoining civilian emergency telephone systems. In
    some cases areas are covered by more than one PSAP boundary. In these cases, any
    of the applicable PSAPs may take a 911 call. Where a specific call is routed may
    depend on how busy the applicable PSAPS are (i.e. load balancing), operational status
    (i.e. redundancy), or time of date / day of week. If an area does not have 911 service,
    TGS included that area in the dataset along with the address and phone number of
    their dispatch center. These are areas where someone must dial a 7 or 10 digit number
    to get emergency services. These records can be identified by a "Y" in the [NON911EMNO]
    field. This indicates that dialing 911 inside one of these areas does not connect
    one with emergency services. This dataset was constructed by gathering information
    about PSAPs from state level officials. In some cases this was geospatial information,
    in others it was tabular. This information was supplemented with a list of PSAPs
    from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Each PSAP was researched to verify
    its tabular information. In cases where the source data was not geospatial, each
    PSAP was researched to determine its service area in terms of existing boundaries
    (e.g. city and county boundaries). In some cases existing boundaries had to be modified
    to reflect coverage areas (e.g. u00e2u0080u009centire county north of Country Road
    30u00e2u0080u009d). However, there may be cases where minor deviations from existing
    boundaries are not reflected in this dataset, such as the case where a particular
    PSAPs coverage area includes an entire county, and the homes and businesses along
    a road which is partly in another county. Text fields in this dataset have been
    set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. All
    diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with
    their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems
    that may not support diacritics.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
