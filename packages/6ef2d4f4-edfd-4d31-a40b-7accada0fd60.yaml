    data set contains all CalWater 2.2.1 Planning Watersheds (PWS) where CDFW has documented
    summer run steelhead to be present during or after 1990. It was developed for the
    express purpose of assisting with anadromous fish recovery planning efforts. NOTE:
    Acreages are calculated for area inside California only. It is important to note
    that this data set does not attempt to model the entire possible distribution of
    the species. Rather, it only represents planning watersheds intersecting the known
    distribution, which is based on where the species has been observed and reported.
    While the distribution data may indeed represent the extent of the species, generally
    the upstream extent of the distribution only represents the location of positive
    sampling or other observations.. Therefore, this data set likely represents an underestimation
    of the absolute geographic distribution of the species. Data Source: This watershed
    level data set was derived by intersecting Calwater planning watersheds with point
    and line features depicting summer run steelhead distribution. These features are
    derived from a subset of data contained in the Aquatic Species Observation Database
    (ASOD), a Microsoft Access multi-species observation data capture application. ASOD
    is an ongoing project developed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife
    (CDFW), Northern Region, Environmental Resource Information Services with assistance
    from CDFW Biogeographic Data Branch and Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission.
    These data are based upon confirmed observations of Coho salmon. Effort has been
    made to identify and correct watersheds that were erroneously selected due to inaccuracies
    from using data of different scales. The observation data that are the basis for
    the distribution were compiled from a variety of disparate sources including but
    not limited to CDFW, U.S. Forest Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, timber
    companies, and the public. Forms of documentation include CDFW administrative reports,
    personal communications with biologists, observation reports, and literature reviews.
    This derived dataset is meant to be continually updated as additional information
    is acquired. As such, any copy of this dataset is considered to be a snapshot of
    the known Summer Run Steelhead Distribution at the time of release. It is incumbent
    upon the user to ensure that they have the most recent version prior to making management
    or planning decisions. Data Usage: Examples of appropriate uses include: Anadromous
    fish recovery planning Evaluation of future survey sites for Steelhead Validating
    steelhead distribution models Examples of inappropriate uses include: Using this
    data to make parcel or ground level land use management decisions. Using this data
    set to prove or support non-existence of steelhead at any spatial scale. Assuming
    that steelhead are prevalent throughout the entire watershed. All users of this
    data should seek the assistance of qualified professionals such as surveyors, hydrologists,
    or fishery biologists as needed to ensure that such users possess complete, precise,
    and up to date information on steelhead distribution and water body location. Please
