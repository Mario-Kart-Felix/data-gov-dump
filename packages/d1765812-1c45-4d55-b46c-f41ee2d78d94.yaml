  Prediction's Tidal Creeks: Sentinel Habitat Database was developed to support the
  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations' (NOAA) Hollings Marine Laboratory
  (HML) Oceans and Human Health Initiative (OHHI). The goal of the program is to provide
  the scientific information and framework for forecasting environmental and human
  health risks across estuarine habitats, watersheds, and regions which includes the
  testing of new technologies developed by other HML OHH groups. This includes a wide
  range of data from tidal creek systems which are being used as the sentinel habitat
  for assessing and predicting the impact of coastal development on estuarine systems.
  Sampling has occurred in South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi.
  Historical data from 1994, 1995, 2000 as well as recent data from 2005, 2006, and
  2008 are included in the database. A wide range of parameters have been sampled
  in the estuarine tidal creek systems and their watersheds to obtain data on water
  quality (e.g., nutrients, pathogens, dissolved oxygen, salinity), sediment quality
  (e.g., characteristics, chemical contaminants), biological condition (e.g., macrobenthos,
  fish, organism health) , human exposure (e.g., pathogens), and watershed attributes
  (e.g., land cover, impervious cover, demographics). Each creek was sampled from
  its headwaters to its junction with a large open estuary. The creeks represented
  the range of land use types and human uses that occur in the Southeastern and Gulf
  regions, including forested, suburban, and urban watersheds. Results of these studies
  indicate that the amount and type of watershed development are linked to changes
  in creek environmental quality including increased fecal coliform levels, decreased
  sediment quality, changes in the kinds and abundances of biota, changes in the abundance
  of juvenile fish, and decreases in the abundance of shrimp that use these habitats
  as nurseries. These findings suggest that the shallow estuarine habitats that form
  the primary link with the land provide early warning of impairment and may be sentinels
  of ensuing harm from land-based activities. The levels of microbial and chemical
  contamination in these headwater environments are frequently an order of magnitude
  greater than that reported for deeper open water environments. Shallow or headwater
  tidal creeks are, in effect, the \"first responders\" to impacts of non-point source
  pollution runoff.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\":
