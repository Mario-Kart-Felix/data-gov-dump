    (MISR) Validation team was deployed to the Sua Pan salt playa in the Magkadigkadi
    region of Botswana during the SAFARI 2000 Dry Season Aircraft Campaign to collect
    various data sets for validating the MISR LAI/FPAR algorithm. Ground measurements
    of leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation
    (FPAR) were made using the LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer and Sunfleck PAR ceptometer,
    respectively, during focused periods from August 20 to August 28, 2000 at a dry
    grassland site adjacent to the Sua Pan. The 1 km by 1 km sampling grid was a homogeneous,
    relatively dense grassland, with a height of 20-100 cm and two prevalent grass types,
    Odyssea paucinervis and Sporobolus spicatus. Associated reflectance measurements
    were made with the PARABOLA and ASD instruments (Helmlinger et al., 2004a; 2004b).The
    data files contain measurements of LAI and PAR reflectance and transmission and
    a description of sky conditions during the sampling periods. With one exception,
    all measurements were made under clear sky conditions.  PAR data were measured only
    on the transect scale while LAI are provided at both pixel and transect scales.
    PAR readings were performed at 93 transect sample points, and LAI readings were
    performed at 135 (93 transect and 42 subgrid) sample points. Each file also contains
    mean LAI and PAR values. The data files are ASCII tables, in comma-separated-value
    format.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
