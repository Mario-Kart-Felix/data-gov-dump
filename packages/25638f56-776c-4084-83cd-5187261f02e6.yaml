    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The innovation is a compact, reliable, light
    weight, electrically driven pump capable of pumping cryogenic liquids, based on
    scroll pump technology.  This pump will fulfill several needs stated in SBIR Research
    Topic, H2.01: Cryogenic Fluid Management Technologies. Zero gravity cryogenic control
    devices (spray bars and mixers), require cryogenic liquids to be pumped efficiently.
    Propellant conditioning and densification technologies require compact, efficient
    pumps. Broad area cooling of cryopropellant shields can be facilitated by the pumping
    of a cold gas such as helium in a loop from a cryocooler to a shield. Various methods
    of liquefaction of oxygen such as passive radiative cooling can be enabled by cryogenic
    pumping. Other aerospace applications such as a fuel pump for liquid hydrogen fueled
    aircraft.  A compact, reliable, and light weight pump for cryogenic liquids currently
    does not exist.  Our subcontractor, Ball Aerospace and Technologies, has identified
    the need for such a pump several years ago, but has not found a suitable available
    product.rnrnScroll pumps have several advantages over other pump technology, including
    being compact, light weight, reliable and efficient.  The pump can be hermetically
    isolated from the drive motor by the use of a magnetic coupler, allowing the pump
    to be hermetically sealed. Because of the orbital motion, the scrolls can be placed
    in a metal bellows that are sealed to the housing which isolates the liquid via
    a vacuum enclosure for thermal isolation. The bearings can be placed on thermally
    isolating arms, so they do not need to operate at cryogenic temperatures.rnrnScroll
    pumps have considerable technical heritage relevant to this application. Air Squared
    has developed and successfully tested scroll pumps for liquids and for cryogenic
    gasses. Air Squared has developed several compact pumps for pumping air which has
    similar viscosity and compressibility to liquid hydrogen.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
