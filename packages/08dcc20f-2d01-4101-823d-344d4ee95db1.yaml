  studies being done to assess and monitor coral reef ecosystems. The intent of this
  work is three fold: (1) to spatially characterize and monitor the distribution,
  abundance, and size of both reef fishes and mega-invertebrates (conch, lobster,
  Diadema); (2) to relate this information to in-situ data collected on water quality
  and associated habitat parameters; (3) to use this information to establish the
  knowledge base necessary for enacting management decisions in a spatial setting
  and to establish the efficacy of those management decisions. Toward this end, the
  Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment's Biogeography Team (BT) has completed
  its fourth year and is beginning its fifth year of work in the US Virgin Islands
  and Puerto Rico. It is critical, with recent changes in management at both locations
  (e.g. implementation of MPAs) as well as proposed changes (e.g. zoning to manage
  multiple human uses) that action is taken now to accurately describe and characterize
  the fish/macro-invertebrate populations in these areas. It is also important that
  BT work closely with the individuals responsible for recommending and implementing
  these management strategies. Recognizing this, BT has been collaborating with partners
  at the University of Puerto Rico, National Park Service, US Geological Survey and
  the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources. To quantify patterns
  of spatial distribution and make meaningful interpretations, we must first have
  knowledge of the underlying variables determining species distribution. The basis
  for this work therefore, is the nearshore benthic habitats maps ( less than 100
  ft depth) created by NOAA's Biogeography Program in 2001 and NOS' bathymetry models.
  Using ArcView GIS software, the digitized habitat maps are stratified to select
  sampling stations. Sites are randomly selected within these strata to ensure coverage
  of the entire study region and not just a particular reef or seagrass area. At each
  site, fish, macro-invertebrates, and associated water quality and habitat information
  is then quantified following standardized protocols. By relating the data collected
  in the field back to the habitat maps and bathymetric models, BT is able to model
  and map species level and community level information. These protocols are standardized
  throughout the US Caribbean to enable quantification and comparison of reef fish
  abundance and distribution trends between locations. Armed with the knowledge of
  where \"hot spots\" of species richness and diversity are likely to occur in the
  seascape, the BT is in a unique position to answer questions about the efficacy
  of marine zoning strategies (e.g. placement of no fishing, anchoring, or snorkeling
  locations), and what locations are most suitable for establishing MPAs. Knowledge
  of the current status of fish/macro-invertebrate communities coupled with longer
  term monitoring will enable evaluation of management efficacy, thus it is essential
  to future management actions.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\":
