    reported in Iowa in 1959 (Bowles, 1975). This first record was of three hibernating
    individuals, in a Dubuque County cave. Since 1959, the species has been found at
    22 sites in 14 counties. Walnut Creek National Wildlife Refuge, located two miles
    southwest of Prairie City, is at the northern extent of the known summer range for
    this species in Iowa. The first Indiana bat captured on the refuge was an adult
    female with enlarged mammae (Appendix I). She was caught in a mist net on June 7,
    1992 during the initial fauna survey of the refuge. A juvenile male was captured
    on June 30 of the same year and a pregnant female on May 25, 1993. These captures
    indicated that a maternity colony was almost certainly located on the refuge. Telemetry
    studies in Illinois (Garner and Gardner, 1991 and 1992) and Missouri (Callahan,
    1993) described the various types of trees used by maternal colonies. Although Indiana
    bats used similar roosts in both states there were differences, such as the distance
    of roosts from roads. Gardner et. al. (1991) suggested that Indiana bats avoided
    heavily traveled  roads when selecting roost sites. Callahan (1993) found that 22%
    of the roost trees identified during his study were within 100 m of a road. Because
    of these and other differences it is valuable to collect and compare information
    about summer habitat use across the range for this species. Range-wide data is needed
    to determine the summer habitat requirements for this species.",nt"owner_org":
