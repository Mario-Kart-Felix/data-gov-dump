  in the Proposed Plan of the Great Basin Region, Idaho-SW Montana Sub-region, Greater

  Management Areas were delineated by BLM, U.S. Forest Service, State of Idaho and
  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service based on considerations of sage-grouse occupancy,
  landscape, habitat and land use/adaptive management opportunities.This data was
  developed as the Administrative Draft Proposed Plan (ADPP). for the Great Basin
  Region, Idaho-SW Montana Sub-region, Greater Sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus)
  Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). This layer was edited 5/7/2015 at the WO direction
  to add three areas of non-habitat in the Sagebrush Focal Areas as PHMA. See procesing
  steps.Priority Habitat Management Areas (PHMA) have the highest conservation value
  based on various sage-grouse population and habitat considerations and reflect the
  most restrictive management designed to promote sage-grouse conservation. Important
  Habitat Management Areas (IHMA) are closely aligned with PHMA, but management is
  somewhat less restrictive, providing additional management flexibility. The General
  Habitat Management Areas (GHMA) designation is the least restrictive due to generally
  lower occupancy of sage-grouse and more marginal habitat conditions.A decision was
  made in September 2014 by the Washington Office that all sub-regions would use a
  consistent naming convention for identifying Habitat Management Areas (HMA). These
  are Priority Habitat Management Area (PHMA) and General Habitat Management Area
  (GHMA). The Idaho and Southwestern Montana sub-region has an additional HMA identified
  as Important Habitat Management Area (IHMA). Attributes in this layer were updated
  9/26/2014. Core updated to PHMA, Important updated to IHMA, and General updated
  to GHMA.The layer was renamed from ManagementZones_Alt_G_05272014_Final to ManagementAreas_Alt_G_05272014_final.
  The field identifying the Management Areas was renamed from Management_Zone to Habitat_Management_Area.ManagementAreas_Alt_G_05272014_final
