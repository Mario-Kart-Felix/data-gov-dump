    files (.dbf) are an extract of selectedn          geographic and cartographic information
    from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
    Encoding and Referencingn          (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents
    a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line
    shapefile isn          designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they
    can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Census tracts are small, relatively
    permanentn          statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and
    were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical
    Areasn          Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations
    where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined
    ton          participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a
    stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison
    back ton          previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population
    size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  When
    firstn          delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect
    to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  The spatialn
             size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.
     Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, newn          development,
    and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally
    are split due to population growth, or combined as an          result of substantial
    population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable
    features.  They may follow legal boundaries suchn          as minor civil division
    (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for
    census tract-to-governmental unit relationshipsn          where the governmental
    boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries
    always are census tract boundaries in the standardn          census geographic hierarchy.
     In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These
    noncontiguous areas may occur where then          census tracts are coextensive
    with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the
    2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400n          through 9499 was enforced
    for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to
    Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarilyn          covered by federally
    recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the
    code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for thosen          census tracts that
    contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land
    use area such as a National Park, military installation,n          or a business/industrial
    park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts
    that contained only water area, no land area.n        ",nt"license_title":
