    waterbody features from the 2001 version of the PNW River Reach files Arc/INFO coverage.
    Separate, companion feature classes are also available from StreamNet, including
    the base hydrographic ARCS and a whole stream LLID based ROUTE system. Background:
    The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Portland, in cooperation with Bonneville Power
    Administration, the Northwest Power Planning Council, and other Federal and state
    agencies and NW Indian Tribes produced a 1:100,000-scale River Reach data layer
    for the Pacific Northwest in the early 1990s. The Pacific Northwest (PNW) 1:100k
    River Reach Files (RF3) are a geo-referenced river reach data layer that encompasses
    the Columbia River Basin within the conterminous United States, the coasts of Oregon
    and Washington, Puget Sound in Washington, the Klamath and Goose Lake Basins in
    southern Oregon and the Bear Lake Basin in southeastern Idaho. The system is basically
    a 1:100,000 scale enhancement of the pre-existing 1:250,000 scale EPA River Reach
    File 2 (RF2). The RF3 creation process was a primary task of the PNW River Reach
    Project because these reach identifiers are an integral hydrologic component in
    a regional rivers and fisheries information system now known as StreamNet (formerly
    the Coordinated Information System (CIS) and the Northwest Environmental Database
    (NED)). StreamNet is an ongoing effort by federal, state, and tribal organizations
    within the region to compile reach and stream specific information pertinent to
    the Region's fish and wildlife resources in Oregon, Idaho, Washington, and western
    Montana. The PNW Reach Files carry the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (US
    EPA) river reach numbers. The system was transferred over to the StreamNet project
    at Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) in early 1997 for maintenance,
    enhancement, and distribution. This dataset was last updated in August of 2001 and
    includes changes and corrections to the 100k Reach Files originally posted on the
    streamnet site (www.streamnet.org) in the fall of 1997. Numerous routing errors
    have been corrected, flow direction of routes and arcs has been made consistent,
    and attribute miscodes have been addressed. In addition, the files maintained by
    WDFW, IDFG, ODFW, and MFWP have been made consistent, especially in the hucs along
    the state borders. All of the LLIDs in these coverages have been approved by the
    state fish and wildlife agencies, and will be kept unchanged unless compelling reasons
    necessitate updates. Some routes may have LLIDs different than those posted in earlier
    versions, but every effort has been made to minimize this as much as is practical.
    This particular feature class includes the ARC features from the 2001 version of
    the PNW River Reach files Arc/INFO coverage. A separate, companion feature class
    contains the ROUTES built upon this layer's LLID attribute and is also available
    from the StreamNet Project. Please see the supplemental information section for
    additional details and contact StreamNetGIS@psmfc.org if you have any questions.",nt"license_title":
