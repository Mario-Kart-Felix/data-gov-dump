    2010 housing unit count and population. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded
    on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad
    tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county
    limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Blocks are the
    smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial
    census. A block may consist of one or more faces.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
