    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;A key challenge in building a large
    pixel heterodyne array is efficiently and simultaneously delivering the astronomical
    signal and local oscillator power to each pixel and conveying the output signal
    from each pixel. When an array is conceived simply by tightly stacking individual
    receivers, which is the favored approach for high performance arrays, we soon encounter
    practical topological difficulties in getting the signals in and out: For CHAI there
    are 128 rf/local oscillator ports, IF signal outputs, mixer bias supply lines in
    a unit that is no bigger than 4 inches on a side. The key to our approach is to
    develop a highly integrated LO distribution network and build it into the array.&amp;nbsp;
    Many mixer elements are thus pumped by a single source, although the resistive losses
    in the waveguide hampers the approach for large number of pixels. Second, we will
    investigate the use of the microwave ribbon cables to draw the signal from the mixer
    block. Although coaxial cables are used in coherent receiver systems, even small
    diameter semirigid cables become unwieldy when a small number is involved. The ribbon
    will convey the signal to the low-noise amplifier array. Several variations of the
    overall architecture will be evaluated: the differences between single-ended and
    balanced mixer approaches for a practical instrument will be investigated. While
    the SUPERCAM instrument has a high degree of integration with the LNA array, the
    LO and rf beams are still diplexed using a beam splitter approach. Most of the volume
    of the instrument (~1 cu meter) is simply space occupied by the quasioptical coupling
    scheme. A more integrated LO subsubsystem could drastically reduce the required
    volume. In addition, SUPERCAM uses 64 stainless steel coaxial lines to convey the
    signal from the front-end to the outside. This adds substantial requirements on
    the cryogenic system and mechanically stresses the focal plane. A ribbon cable to
    convey the signal from the mixer array to the LNA array and from the LNA array to
    the outside world is thus a much more elegant approach for implementing a high-pixel
    count heterodyne array.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the overall concept design
    is complete, various subsystems will be evaluated in an affordable manner. (1) For
    the LO distribution network, the plan is to design, fabricate and evaluate small
    cells of the LO distribution network operating at various frequencies to establish
    their feasibility. For a THz distribution network, for example, the final diode
    would have to be placed next to the mixer, as the high waveguide losses will not
    allow any significant path lengths. (2) Depending on the application the LNA array
    may be incorporated into the mixer array (aircraft/ground-based instrument) or be
    kept at a different thermal environment from the mixer (balloon or space-based instrument).
    These two different configurations will obviously entail different designs for the
    integrated heterodyne array. CHAI can potentially use either approach, and for reasons
    of ease of testing the latter is currently preferred. Approaches to implementing
    both types will be developed and described. (3) The IF is conveyed from the IF amplifiers
    (and possibly to them as well) by microwave flexible cables, and although this technology
    is not novel, their use in an astronomical heterodyne receiver has not been demonstrated.
    Samples would be designed, procured, and measured in the relevant environment and
    evaluated for loss, cross talk and survivability through multiple deep cryogenic
    cycles.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
