    files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information
    from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
    Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents a seamless
    national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile
    is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to
    cover the entire nation.  The Area Hydrography Shapefile contains the geometry and
    attributes of both perennial and intermittent area hydrography features, including
    ponds, lakes, oceans, swamps (up to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit), glaciers,
    and the area covered by large rivers, streams, and/or canals that are represented
    as double-line drainage.  Single-line drainage water features can be found in the
    Linear Hydrography Shapefile (LINEARWATER.shp).  Linear water features includes
    single-line drainage water features and artificial path features, where they exist,
    that run through double-line drainage features such as rivers, streams, and/or canals,
    and serve as a linear representation of these features.",nt"license_title":
