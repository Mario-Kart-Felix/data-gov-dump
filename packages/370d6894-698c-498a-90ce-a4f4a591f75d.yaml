    and testing of a new alumina-silicate based multi-purpose, cost-effective, &amp;lsquo;green&amp;rsquo;
    cementitious binder (geopolymer) capable of acting as a high performance refractory
    material with both a low ablation rate and a high early mechanical strength. This
    work was built upon previous research undertaken by the research team in the areas
    of geopolymer binders. Full scale and laboratory controlled tests were performed
    to compare geopolymer performance to currently available commercial products (e.g.
    Sentinel, Greencast). Geopolymer&amp;rsquo;s thermal shock resistance properties
    were tested on eleven different fly ash stockpiles specimens from around the world.
    The geopolymer specimens were subjected to ASTM C-1100 (Standard Test Method for
    Ribbon Thermal Shock Testing of Refractory Materials). Samples were subjected to
    incremental 5-5-5-15-30 second flame exposure durations and to a 15 or 30 accumulated
    exposure, depending on the sample performance (e.g., if the plume became detached).
    Field test durations were limited to prevent excessive erosion of the test panels
    and subsequent plume detachment. Laboratory testing also demonstrated that geopolymer
    could withstand thermal shock and exposure to flame. Additionally, a computational
    model was created to determine the optimal chemical ratios for geopolymer to be
    exposed to elevated temperatures. Additionally, due to their excellent adhesion
    to pre-existing surfaces geopolymer binders were proven to be good candidates for
    use in repair of existing structures upon which they were applied and retrofitted;
    this was demonstrated and observed via tests conducted on repaired tested panels.
    Overall, the demonstration testing program revealed that the geopolymer products
    had equal or superior performance compared to commercial refractories currently
    used by NASA.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
