	"notes": "The objective of this work is to quantify the reduction of biofilm formation in a water distribution system resulting from an organoselenium surface coating on stainless steel pipes and fittings.  Differentiated from currently marketed antimicrobials, selenium, is permanent, catalytic and does not leach into the environment. This will reduce the problems associated with biofilm growth and fouling in the water recycling system.. Thus, we could draw quantifiable conclusions about the system performance for long term missions in complex water treatment systems containing organoselenium coatings and provide the data to NASA engineers who may then make an assessment as to whether or not this is a viable technology to reduce the need for biocides, reduce ESM, and potentially impact NASA by decreasing the chemical burden for treatment which would decrease payload mass and downtime affecting astronauts' efficiency.\r\nThe project will quantify the impact of an organoselenium surface coating within stainless steel pipes and fittings on product water quality and service life of the pipes and fittings over time.   \r\nObjective 1.  Optimize the attachment of organoselenium to the surface of stainless steel to achieve the greatest and most reliable reduction in biofilm growth and formation.\r\nObjective 2.  Assess performance of the organoselenium surface treatment of stainless steel pipes and fittings in a bench-scale system over varied periods of time (i.e. 1 week, 1 month, 3 months) against biofilm accumulation and service capacity.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
