    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    text reports on safety, maintenance, and associated issues. The Aviation Safety
    Reporting System (ASRS) spans several decades and contains over 700 000 reports.
    The Aviation Safety Action Plan (ASAP) contains over 12 000 reports from various
    airlines. Problem categorizations have been developed for both ASRS and ASAP to
    enable identification of system problems. However, repository volume and complexity
    make human analysis difficult. Multiple experts are needed, and they often disagree
    on classifications. Even the same person has classified the same document differently
    at different times due to evolving experiences. Consistent classification is necessary
    to support tracking trends in problem categories over time. A decision support system
    that performs consistent document classification quickly and over large repositories
    would be useful. We discuss the results of two algorithms we have developed to classify
    ASRS and ASAP documents. The first is Mariana---a support vector machine (SVM) with
    simulated annealing, which is used to optimize hyperparameters for the model. The
    second method is classification built on top of nonnegative matrix factorization
    (NMF), which attempts to find a model that represents document features that add
    up in various combinations to form documents. We tested both methods on ASRS and
    ASAP documents with the latter categorized two different ways. We illustrate the
    potential of NMF to provide document features that are interpretable and indicative
    of topics. We also briefly discuss the tool that we have incorporated Mariana into
    in order to allow human experts to provide feedback on the document categorizations.",nt"owner_org":
