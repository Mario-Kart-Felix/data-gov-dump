  Interior compiled available information from seabird observation datasets from the
  Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf into a single database, with the goal of conducting
  research and informing coastal and offshore planning activities. The cooperators
  were the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's (BOEM) Environmental Studies Program
  (http://www.boem.gov/Environmental-Stewardship/Environmental-Studies/Environmental-Studies.aspx),
  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) Division of Migratory Bird Management
  (http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/) and the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Patuxent
  Wildlife Research Center (http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov). The resulting product is the
  Atlantic Offshore Seabird Dataset Catalog, which characterizes the survey effort
  and bird observations that have been collected across space and time. Currently,
  the database contains ~60 datasets from 1906-2009 with over 260,000 records of seabird
  observations. Data will initially be provided as summary web mapping services, with
  web feature services (for downloading and looking at single-species data) at the
  linkage given elsewhere in this document. USAGE: Seabirds provide unique challenges
  even when using estimation techniques to sample populations (e.g., Tasker et al.
  1984, Spear et al. 1992). To date, there has been little consistency among survey
  designs. Surveys have varied by the type of vessel from which they are conducted
  (ship, plane), the methodology that counts are made, the width of the area being
  counted, and equipment used, among many other differences. Under such circumstances,
  comparing results and making inferences can be difficult. Because these estimates
  of effort-adjusted counts do not account for detection probability, they are likely
  biased by factors that affect this parameter such as weather, survey method, observer,
  or other environmental variables (MacKenzie et al. 2006). Such results may be considered
  nau00c3u00afve in that they do not account for factors that can affect the ability
  to detect an animal. Furthermore, these results contain data collected over a 30
  year period without regard for any long term temporal changes that may have occurred
  with species or the environment. Further analysis is necessary to determine if such
  changes have occurred with any species. While it is possible to separate data collected
  recently from historical (>20 years old) datasets, the amount of recent data is
  limited and therefore maps showing only these data may be limited spatially. Finally,
  effort calculations do not account for survey width, while normally static during
  a survey, can be reduced during certain conditions and does vary by survey method,
  especially boat vs. plan surveys. The vast majority of survey data collected offshore
  U.S. Atlantic waters were collected using similar techniques and so effort data
  will not be greatly affected by such discrepancies. Still, such differences do exist
  and were not accounted for; therefore, this estimate of survey effort is a rough
  surrogate for effort. Consequently, the effort-adjusted counts will also be affected
  by differences in survey methodology and should be considered only roughly offset
  by effort.\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"Creative Commons Attribution\",\n\t\"extras\":
