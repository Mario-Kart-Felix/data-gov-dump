    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The Earthquake - At 5:46 A.M. local time
    on January 17, 1995, a major earthquake occurred near the City of Kobe, Japan. The
    6.9 magnitude earthquake had 40 km of bilateral rupture from a hypocenter 10 km
    under the northern tip of the island of Awaji in the Sea of Japan. The greatest
    intensity of shaking was in a narrow corridor of two to four kilometers stretching
    40 km along the coast of Osaka Bay. The ground moved as much as five meters in some
    places. The worst destruction ran along the previously undetected fault on the coast,
    east of Kobe. Kobe's major business, industrial and port facilities, and residences
    are located in this strip. Note: This earthquake is also called the Hyogo-Ken Nambu,
    Japan, Earthquake and Southern Hyogo Prefecture Earthquake.The Damage - The earthquake
    caused extensive damage to the coastal cities that border Osaka Bay and to the northern
    portion of Awaji Island. Inland cities located near the northern end of the fault
    rupture sustained significant damage. Osaka (Japan's second largest city), Kyoto,
    and Shiga, farther to the northeast, reported extensive damage from the quake. The
    earthquake caused 5,480 deaths, the highest death toll in Japan since the Great
    Kanto Earthquake of 1923 (142,000 deaths). About 94,900 people were injured; nearly
    317,000 people moved to evacuation centers.Buildings - More than 192,700 houses
    and buildings were totally destroyed by the earthquake. Most of the damaged buildings
    were unsafe to occupy and had to be torn down later. The repair costs to buildings
    were estimated at more than $100 billion (U.S. Dollars). The design code in effect
    at the time of the construction was a major factor in determining the extent of
    damage to the commercial and residential buildings. Modern high-rise buildings typically
    fared better than older residential construction.Transportation - Kobe is located
    within the main transportation corridor between central and southern Honshu. The
    Hanshin Expressway, supported by large hammerhead reinforced concrete piers, failed
    over a twenty kilometer length. The supporting steel girders of the Wangan Expressway
    (along the harbor shore) were dislodged from their seats, although few collapsed.
    Rail facilities were particularly hard hit. All three main lines through the corridor
    sustained embankment failures, overpass collapses, distorted rails, and other severe
    damage. The elevated viaduct that carries the Bullet Train was severely damaged
    when supporting columns underwent shear failure. There was damage to the subway
    systems, including a rare instance of severe earthquake damage to a modern tunnel
    for reasons other than fault displacement near the portal. Rail and road transportation
    disruption affected a number of companies relying on rapid production systems. Due
    to effects on transportation, automobile and motorcycle manufacturers temporarily
    shut down factories located far from the earthquake site.Port Damage - The port
    of Kobe, one of the largest container facilities in the world, sustained major damage.
    Shipping had to be diverted to other ports. Cessation of port functions impeded
    the shipment of raw materials and parts between businesses in Japan and their subsidiaries
    or partners overseas. This impacted the electronics, apparel, and auto manufacturing
    industries. There was severe and widespread liquefaction as a result of the earthquake.
    Lateral ground deformation caused the piers of the highway bridge and electric rail
    bridge between Port Island and Kobe to lean between two and three degrees toward
    the waterfront. Of 186 heavy shipping berths, 179 were inoperable after the earthquake.Utilities
    - Electric power and telecommunications services were not disrupted, but most of
    Kobe lost essential services such as water, water treatment, and gas utilities.
    Electrical power performed well with very little reduction in service during the
    earthquake, and was completely restored within one week. Underground water pipelines
    sustained severe damage in the earthquake. Numerous breaks resulted in a general
    lack of service in Kobe, Ashiya, and Nishinomiya. Water was restored within two
    weeks and gas was restored within a month.Fires - Almost 150 fires started, most
    within minutes of the earthquake, and primarily in densely built-up low rise areas
    of the city. The fires destroyed one million square meters of residential area in
    Kobe.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key": "bbox-east-long",ntt"value":
