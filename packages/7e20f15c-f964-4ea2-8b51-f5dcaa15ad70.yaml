    probability of elevated nitrate concentrations in groundwater in the Eagle River
    watershed valley-fill aquifer, Eagle County, North-Central Colorado, 2006-2007.
    This data set was developed by a cooperative project between the U.S. Geological
    Survey, Eagle County, the Eagle River Water and Sanitation District, the Town of
    Eagle, the Town of Gypsum, and the Upper Eagle Regional Water Authority. This project
    was designed to evaluate potential land-development effects on groundwater and surface-water
    resources so that informed land-use and water management decisions can be made.
    This groundwater probability map and its associated probability maps was developed
    as follows: (1) A point data set of wells with groundwater quality and groundwater
    age data was overlaid with thematic layers of anthropogenic (related to human activities)
    and hydrogeologic data by using a geographic information system to assign each well
    values for depth to groundwater, distance to major streams and canals, distance
    to gypsum beds, precipitation, soils, and well depth. These data then were downloaded
    to a statistical software package for analysis by logistic regression. (2) Statistical
    models predicting the probability of elevated nitrate concentrations, the probability
    of unmixed young water (using chlorofluorocarbon-11 concentrations and tritium activities),
    and the probability of elevated volatile organic compound concentrations were developed
    using logistic regression techniques. (3) The statistical models were entered into
    a GIS and the probability map was constructed.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":

    This probability map is designed to portray the likelihood of groundwater in the
    Eagle River watershed valley-fill aquifer to be affected by anthropogenic (related
    to human activities) contamination. This map does not show areas that are actually
    (currently) contaminated; rather, it shows the areas that have a high likelihood
    for being contaminated if nitrate was released to the environment in the terms of
    percent probability. Probability is a statistical measure of how likely an event
    will occur. Probability is not the same as certainty. A well in a high-probability
    area is not necessarily contaminated because contamination also can depend on the
    type of contaminant released, how much of that contaminant was released, and other
    factors not taken into account by the logistic regression models. Although the probability
    maps show predictions of detections as a percent probability, there is inherent
    uncertainty within these predictions that is not shown in the probability map. This
    probability map is intended to be a first approximation at developing a consistent
    rating method for the entire study area and may have several limitations for use
    at the site or field scale. The model and map does not account for local point sources
    of contaminants or features and processes that may promote focused recharge, preferential
    ground-water flow, or bypass mechanisms. Additional site-specific data are needed
    before site-specific decisions are made, such as the site-specific design of a wastewater-disposal
    system. The Eagle River watershed is rapidly being developed. As development activities
    continue, some variables such as surficial soils and irrigation networks may be
    altered through construction activities, which may have unpredictable effects on
    the ground-water probability ratings. This probability map should not be used at
    a scale any larger than 1:24,000, which is the scale of the SSURGO soils data. Probably
    the most appropriate scale to use this data set is 1:100,000, which would help take
    into account the combined inaccuracies of the input data sets used to develop this
    final data set.", "Access Constraints: None"]"nt},nt{ntt"key": "spatial_harvester",ntt"value":
