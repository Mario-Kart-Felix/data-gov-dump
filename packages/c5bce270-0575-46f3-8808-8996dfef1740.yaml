    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LED light sources
    are ideal for plant growth systems. However, commercially available multi-color
    LED illumination panels are designed and manufactured to produce a single particular
    illumination. These panels have very specific LED colors arranged in a very specific
    fashion. This limits the amount of color mixing, intensity variation, and spatial
    arrangement that is possible, precluding passive precision illumination. There is
    no feedback mechanism to detect spectral shifts caused by LED aging and additionally,
    there is no mechanism to modulate LEDs. It is also not possible to integrate an
    imaging system into these panels. Furthermore, these panels are commonly operated
    using high voltage AC power sources, which is not ideal in a potentially wet environment.
    Therefore, to address these issues, custom LED illumination panels were designed
    and developed for this project&amp;rsquo;s plant growth chamber.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A
    systematic approach was taken to determine the general size, specifications, and
    shape of a portable plant growth unit. Once the general size and shape were finalized,
    the detailed design of the support structure, aeroponics, and lighting subsystems
    were developed. Particular attention was given to heat transfer and the expected
    LED thermal environment.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, a&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;computational
    analysis was performed to determine optimal LED nodes placement so that two different
    uniform illumination fields could be yielded:&amp;nbsp; (1) for germinating plants,
    lower intensity light, and (2) for larger maturing plants, a brighter one.&amp;nbsp;
    Also, aeroponic studies were reviewed to identify an efficient and user-friendly
    system that would require minimal user involvement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
