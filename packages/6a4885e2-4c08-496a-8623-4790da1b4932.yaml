  can be used to examine water fluxes in soils beneath tree crops in an Amazonian
  agroforest. The data consists of repeated measurements of soil matrix pressure and
  soil moisture content at several depths. The study was carried out at the Empresa
  Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (Embrapa)-Amazonia Ocidental, 29 km North of
  Manaus, Brazil (3d 8m S, 59d 52m W, 40 - 50 m above sea level), in 1998 and 1999.Microaggregated
  tropical soils have shown high water conductivity even under unsaturated conditions
  in laboratory experiments. It is not clear, however, what depth the infiltrating
  soil water reaches during storm events under humid tropical conditions. Dynamics
  and fluxes of water were determined with high temporal resolution to a depth of
  5 m in a Xanthic Hapludox of central Amazonia, Brazil. The soil water percolated
  to a depth of 0.9 m within 2 h of a rainfall event of 48 mm. Water fluxes were significantly
  slower below 0.9 m (17% of infiltration at 0 - 0.9 m) due to higher bulk densities.
  Percolation not only started rapidly after a rainfall event when soil water suction
  reached a certain threshold (ca. 20 - 30 hPa) but was also reduced to background
  levels less than 1 h after the rain had ended. The demonstrated extremely short-term
  dynamics of water fluxes have implications for measurement design of water availability
  and solute leaching in microaggregated tropical soil that require correct time integrals
  of solution concentrations and soil water dynamics. Measurement intervals of 30
  min or less were necessary in our study. Rapid water flows may explain the observed
  high nutrient losses from the topsoil of microaggregated tropical soil and the large
  accumulation of nutrients in the deep soil (> 5 m).\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S.

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
