    precipitation estimates from the Ku and Ka radars of the Dual-Frequency Precipitation
    Radar (DPR) on the core GPM spacecraft. The output consists of three main classes
    of precipitation products: those derived from the Ku-band frequency over a wide
    swath (245 km), those derived from the Ka-band frequency over a narrow swath (125
    km), and those derived from the dual-frequency data over the narrow swath. The Ka-band
    results are further divided into the standard and high-sensitivity estimates. In
    the standard sensitivity mode, the fields of view within the inner swath are matched
    to those of the Ku-band. Data from these matched-beam Ku- and Ka-band fields of
    view are used to derive the dual-frequency precipitation products. The retrievals
    are performed at each radar range bin along the slant path of the radar instrument
    field of view (IFOV).ntntThe dual-frequency retrieval benefits from having co-aligned
    measurements at Ku- and Ka-bands. Data from these measurements are used to infer
    properties of the particle size distribution, which are expected to lead to improved
    estimates of rainfall rate and equivalent liquid water content. Dual-frequency data
    are expected to improve the capability to discriminate among water, ice, and mixed-phase
    hydrometeors as a function of height. This capability is particularly important
    in convective storms where a bright-band signature, associated with mixed-phase
    hydrometeors, is usually not detectable. In addition, the different attenuation
    rates of the Ku- and Ka-bands allow differential attenuation techniques to be used
    to estimate the path integrated attenuation. The high-sensitivity Ka-band channel
    is expected to have 6 dB greater sensitivity than the Ku- and standard Ka-band channels
    and to provide enhanced detection capabilities at the light rainfall rates.ntntABSTRACT",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
