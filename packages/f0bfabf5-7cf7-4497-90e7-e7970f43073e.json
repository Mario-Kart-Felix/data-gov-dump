	"notes": "This image represents a 1 meter resolution backscatter mosaic of the Abrir La Sierra Bank off the coast of western Puerto Rico, collected using a SeaBat Reson 8124 (200 kHz) multibeam echosounder.NOAA's NOS\/NCCOS\/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the U.S. Caribbean from 4\/14\/07 to 4\/24\/07. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) and with a moon pool-mounted Reson 8124 multibeam echosounder (200 kHz). It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 19 north, datum NAD83. The backscatter component of the bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using Geocoder 3.0 software. Acoustic backscatter mosaics are ostensibly an important piece of information when characterizing surficial seafloor features and delineating benthic habitats.The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependent on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.",
