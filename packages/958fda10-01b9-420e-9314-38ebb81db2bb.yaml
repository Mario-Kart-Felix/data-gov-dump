    contamination remains a critical technique in the mitigation of risk to crew health
    and vehicle systems during human spaceflight missions. Current methods of bacterial
    and fungal monitoring on the International Space Station (ISS) depend on culturing
    of microorganisms during spaceflight and subsequent ground-based identification.
    This approach requires substantial crew time, uses consumables with short shelf
    lives, and prevents a rapid response to microbial contamination. To address these
    limitations for future missions beyond low-Earth orbit, a biosensor using gold nanoparticles
    is being developed for the rapid detection of medically significant microorganisms.
    For proof-of-concept, we have targeted the detection of Staphylococcus aureus, a
    common infectious agent that has been repeatedly isolated aboard the ISS. Gold nanoparticles
    were modified by the covalent attachment of an antibody that has a high binding
    affinity for a protein on the cell wall of S. aureus. Upon interaction with a sample
    containing S. aureus, binding between the nanoparticles and the bacteria occurred
    rapidly. A significant reduction in the red coloration of the colloidal nanoparticle
    suspension, and the formation of a large purple pellet was observed following a
    brief centrifugation step. Comparison of the absorbance spectra verified the visual
    observation, demonstrating that there was a significant reduction in the absorbance
    of the supernatants of reaction samples in which S. aureus was present. This biosensing
    system provides a rapid means to specifically detect only the targeted organism.
    Further development will potentially lead to a small, lightweight biosensor that
    can be easily adapted to detect other selected microorganisms in real-time, providing
    crews of future spaceflight missions a simple method to autonomously define potential
    infectious disease risks.&lt;/p&gt;rn",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
