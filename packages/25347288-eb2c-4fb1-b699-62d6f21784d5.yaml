  is a subset of the CDFW Lands dataset. It contains only lands owned (fee title)
  and some operated (wildlife areas, ecological reserves, and public/fishing access
  properties that are leases/agreements with other agencies and that may be publicly
  accessible) by CDFW. CDFW Owned and Operated Lands replaces the prior dataset, DFG
  Owned Lands, which only included fee title lands. Please note that some lands may
  not be accessible due to the protection of resources and habitat. It is recommended
  that users contact the appropriate regional office for access information. This
  is a generalized version of the CDFW Owned and Operated Lands dataset that has a
  shorter attribute table than the original version and also has been dissolved based
  on the fields included. The CDFW Lands dataset is a digitized geographical inventory
  of selected lands owned and/or administered by the California Department of Fish
  and Wildlife. Properties such as ecological reserves, wildlife areas, undesignated
  lands containing biological resource values, public and fishing access lands, and
  CDFW fish hatcheries are among those lands included in this inventory. Types of
  properties owned or administered by CDFW which may not be included in this dataset
  are parcels less than 1 acre in size, such as fishing piers, fish spawning grounds,
  fish barriers, and other minor parcels. All CDFW properties (mapped herein or not)
  are assigned a unique Real Property Number (PROP_NBR). A given property may consist
  of one or more parcels, each identified by a unique Parcel History Number (HIST_NBR).
  These two identifiers are assigned by the State of California Department of General
  Services (DGS). Physical boundaries of individual parcels are determined by the
  descriptions contained in legal documents and assessor parcel maps relating to that
  parcel. The approximate parcel boundaries are drawn onto U.S. Geological Survey
  7.5'-series topographic maps, then digitized and attributed before being added to
  the dataset. In some cases, assessor parcel or best available datasets are used
  to digitize the boundary. Using parcel data to adjust the boundaries is a work in
  progress and will be incorporated in the future. Township, range, and section lines
  were based on the U.S. Geological Survey 7.5' series topographic maps (1:24,000
  - scale). In some areas, the boundaries will not align with the Bureau of Land Management's
  Public Lands Survey System (PLSS).\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\":
