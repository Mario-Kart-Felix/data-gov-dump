    2 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of Grammanik Bank south of St. Thomas,
    US Virgin Islands. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with
    NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired
    multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05. Data
    was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and
    processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors
    applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water
    (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone
    20 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE
    surface based on swath angle. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface
    and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool
    'Feature to Raster' was used to generate the final ESRI Grid. The project was conducted
    to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and
    depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according
    to their own needs and standards.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
