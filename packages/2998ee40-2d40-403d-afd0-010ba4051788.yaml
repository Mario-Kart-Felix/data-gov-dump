  (MAPR) presented in this paper is anrninnovative solution for non-intrusively monitoring
  the state of health (SoH) and predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of electronic
  and electromechanical assets by accessing and processing data obtained from a standard
  avionics data bus. To support Integrated Vehicle Health Monitoring (IVHM) initiatives,
  the solution being described here has been designed to be as non-intrusive as possible.
  An innovative, model-driven anomaly diagnostic and fault characterization system
  for electromechanical actuator (EMA) systems was developed to mitigate potentially
  catastrophic faults. EMA systems are used in a wide variety of aircraft applications
  to control critical components such as control surfaces, landing gear and thrust
  vector control. Failure in any one of these systems can compromise passenger safety,
  as well as mission success. A MIL-STD-1553 bus interface and monitor were designed
  to extract environmental (e.g., altitude, air speed, air density) and operational
  (i.e., response of system to a commanded change) data of a representative EMA system
  and to determine whether an anomaly is detected, and the corresponding severity.
  The MIL-STD-1553 bus was chosen as the test bed to develop this approach, due to
  its large installed base and availability of compatible development tools. Advanced
  and unique reasoning methodologies are applied to the extracted data sets to provide
  anomaly detection and fault classification on various fault modes and eventually
  yield SoH and RUL. In this paper we describe a data monitoring unit that will, in
  real time, identify, isolate, and characterize faults and establish their severity
  so that major performance problems can be alleviated. When built, this system will
  consist of a laptop with a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) card slot that
  can accept multiple interfaces to the MAPR software package. The MAPR package will
  be designed to be adaptable for a large number of different platforms, for portability
  and for maximum input data type flexibility. This paper describes a ground-based
  prototype of the technology to show the efficacy of the method.\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
