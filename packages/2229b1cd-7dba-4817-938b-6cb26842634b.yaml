    cost of air traffic delays and cancellations, of which about 60&#37; are estimated
    to be avoidable. Traffic Management Initiatives (TMIs), including reroutes and ground
    delays, are used by Air Traffic Management (ATM) operators to mitigate impact of
    en-route convective weather. The efficiency of today's TMIs leaves a great deal
    to be desired, due in part to insufficient accuracy of today's weather forecast
    products. As new, higher-accuracy probabilistic forecast products are beginning
    to emerge, there is a major functionality gap between their visual aspect (enhancing
    comprehension and decision making by operators) and their application in automated
    NextGen ATM decision support tools. rnOur proposal seeks to address this gap. We
    will develop a prototype tool for automatic generation of "Least-Impact TMIs"
    using probabilistic convective forecast information. This tool will generate a combination
    of least-deviation-from-shortest-path reroute and/or minimum ground delay for each
    flight predicted to be impacted by convective weather.rnInnovation in this proposal:rn?tNew,
    original "step-out-and-scan" rerouting algorithm.rn?tProbabilistic forecast information
    converted to ATM constraints ("permeability") and used to find viable reroute
    paths.rn?tCombination of economical reroutes plus minimum delays resulting in least-impact
    traffic management solutions.rnWe already have a suitable platform for this research:
    the WITI (Weather Impacted Traffic Index) toolset developed by Principal Investigator,
    Dr. Klein, funded by the FAA and the National Weather Service. It can ingest actual
    and forecast weather, traffic demand, airport and airspace capacities; as well as
    compute weather permeability by a flight (using the so-called scanning algorithm)
    and airspace capacity degradation due to weather. NASA sponsored research ("Translating
    Weather Information into TFM Constraints" NRA) is also using WITI technology.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
