    BAEHR*, ARUN VEDACHALAM*, KIRK BORNE*, AND DANIEL SPONSELLER*rnrnAbstract. Collisions
    between pairs of galaxies usually end in the coalescence (merger) of the tworngalaxies.
    Collisions and mergers are rare phenomena, yet they may signal the ultimate fate
    ofrnmost galaxies, including our own Milky Way. With the onset of massive collection
    of astronomicalrndata, a computerized and automated method will be necessary for
    identifying those collidingrngalaxies worthy of more detailed study. This project
    researches methods to accomplish that goal.rnAstronomical data from the Sloan Digital
    Sky Survey (SDSS) and human-provided classificationsrnon merger status from the
    Galaxy Zoo project are combined and processed with machine learningrnalgorithms.
    The goal is to determine indicators of merger status based solely on discovering
    thosernautomated pipeline-generated attributes in the astronomical database that
    correlate most stronglyrnwith the patterns identified through visual inspection
    by the Galaxy Zoo volunteers. In the end,rnwe aim to provide a new and improved
    automated procedure for classification of collisions andrnmergers in future petascale
    astronomical sky surveys. Both information gain analysis (via thernC4.5 decision
    tree algorithm) and cluster analysis (via the Davies-Bouldin Index) are explored
    asrntechniques for finding the strongest correlations between human-identified patterns
    and existingrndatabase attributes. Galaxy attributes measured in the SDSS green
    waveband images are found tornrepresent the most influential of the attributes for
    correct classification of collisions and mergers.rnOnly a nominal information gain
    is noted in this research, however, there is a clear indication ofrnwhich attributes
    contribute so that a direction for further study is apparent.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
