    up-mass and down-mass to ISS are at a premium. The space station itself has a limited
    lifecycle as well, thus long-term and/or high-risk development programs pose issues
    for science 'return on investment', if the technology cannot be adequately matured
    before the station is decommissioned. Thus innovative systems and technologies that
    minimize impact on limiting resources such as up-mass, down-mass and crew time,
    and can do so in the near- to mid-term, are highly desirable. One such area includes
    the various rechargeable battery systems on ISS used extensively for cameras, camcorders,
    laptops, communication systems and other portable science and diagnostic equipment.rn
    rnA common (universal) battery charging system for ISS, with the flexibility to
    accommodate current and future rechargeable battery requirements for payloads and
    equipment, could reduce the cost of use of the ISS for payload developers. Such
    a system would not only simplify the safety and integration process for battery-operated
    ISS applications, but also reduce up-mass by making use of existing ISS resources.
    In its SBIR Phase I program, Aurora Flight Sciences laid the groundwork for such
    a system, based on the needs of current and planned ISS battery system requirements.
    The results of the study indicate that a universal rechargeable battery system is
    feasible and could significantly reduce up-mass and crew-time to support current
    and future ISS programs. Expanding on the feasibility study performed in Phase I,
    Aurora will deliver a protoflight charger system and supporting documentation at
    the conclusion of Phase II. The proposed system will be fully developed in compliance
    with NASA safety and integration criteria within the 2-year SBIR Phase II timeframe,
    facilitating procurement of flight and ground support hardware by NASA in a potential
    Phase III program.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
