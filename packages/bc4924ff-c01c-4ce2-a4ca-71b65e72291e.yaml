    meter cell size representing the bathymetry of a broad portion of seafloor south
    of St. Thomas, USVI, derived from data collected from 3/28/2011 to 4/14/2011. NOAA's
    NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster
    and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry
    data south of St. Thomas and St. John, USVI, from 3/28/11 to 4/14/2011. Data was
    acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95
    kHz) for water depths greater than 75 meters, and with a moon pool flange-mounted
    Reson 7125 multibeam echosounder (dual frequecy, 200/400 kHz) for water depths of
    up to 75 meters. It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software.
    Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced
    to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS.
    Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to
    generate a CARIS BASE surface based on CUBE. A BAG file was exported from the BASE
    surface, and converted to a GeoTIFF in ESRI ArcMap 10.The project was conducted
    to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and
    depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according
    to their own needs and standards.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
