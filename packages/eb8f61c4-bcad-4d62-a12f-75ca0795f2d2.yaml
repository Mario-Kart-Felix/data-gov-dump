    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Composites are produced from multiple Advanced
    Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) daily observations that have been composited
    together to create a nearly cloud-free image showing maximum greenness. An NDVI
    ratio is produced from bands one and two of the AVHRR composite to produce a derived

    and Alaska Weekly and biweekly NDVI composites date from January 1989 to present.
    U.S. composites are cast to the Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area projection. Alaska
    composites are cast to the Albers Equal-Area Conic projection. Distribution of the
    NDVI composites depends on the age of the image: 7- and 14-day (current) NDVI composites
    are weekly and biweekly updates produced within the last four weeks. The data includes
    a composite for each of the acquired AVHRR bands, as well as a derived NDVI band.
    7- and 14-day (recent) NDVI composites are weekly and biweekly updates produced
    from the end of the previous year until four weeks prior to present. The data includes
    a composite for each of the acquired AVHRR bands, as well as a derived NDVI band.
    14-day (historical) NDVI composites consist of biweekly composites produced from
    January 1989 to the end of the previous year. The data includes a composite for
    each of the acquired AVHRR bands, as well as a derived NDVI band. Satellite zenith,
    solar zenith, relative azimuth, and acquisition dates are also provided.",nt"license_title":
