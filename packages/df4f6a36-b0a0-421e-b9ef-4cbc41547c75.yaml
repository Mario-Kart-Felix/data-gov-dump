    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;rntOur task is evaluating a specialized
    detector for guidance, navigation and control (GNC) applications. The detector being
    evaluated is a 15 microsecond Latency Asynchronous Temporal Contrast Vision Sensor,
    referred to as a spiking sensor. It detects change in intensity on the detector
    at for very high rate applications. Each pixel on the detector operates independently,
    and detects intensity changes on the pixel. When the change in intensity exceeds
    a threshold and an event is generated. The events are reported from the detector
    as an asynchronous stream of digital pixel addresses and time tag (to an accuracy
    ~10 microseconds). This results in a highly reduced set of data returned from detector.
    Hence, only points of interest, not image frame data is output, which reduces data
    volume &amp;gt; 100x. The device is very low power (~25mW). Since the detection
    of the events is done on the detector, not in a processor, the requirements on processing
    are reduced. Because the events are asynchronous, the timing is tied to the event,
    not a frame rate, such as with imagers. For GNC characterization, we performed testing
    on laboratory targets that included a star simulator and Mars terrain targets, as
    well as field testing on star patterns, planets, and International Space station
    (as a beacon test) passes. During the testing, we gained understanding of the details
    of detector biases and operations, and developed processing algorithms for clustering
    and noise rejection on collected data. The current detector design has high dark
    current and low (9&#37;) QE; devices are in design that will give the technology
    a 100x SNR improvement by changes in manufacturing processes (silcon process), and
    front side vs backside illumination. The projection for GNC of the future device
    is part of this task (to be completed at end of May 2012).&lt;/p&gt;rn",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
