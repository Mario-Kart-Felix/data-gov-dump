  \"Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality,
  and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial
  framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems
  and ecosystem components. By recognizing the spatial differences in the capacities
  and potentials of ecosystems, ecoregions stratify the environment purpose regions
  are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across
  federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment same geographical areas (Omernik
  and others, 2000). The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise
  that ecological regions are hierarchical and can be identified through the analysis
  of the spatial patterns and the composition of biotic and abiotic phenomena that
  affect (1987, 1995). These phenomena include geology, physiography, vegetation,
  climate, characteristic varies from one ecological region to another regardless
  of the hierarchical level. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted
  for different levels of ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing
  North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52
  III, the continental United States contains 104 ecoregions and the conterminous
  United States has 84 ecoregions (United States Environmental Protection Agency [USEPA]
  2002). Level IV is a further subdivision of level III ecoregions. Explanations of
  the methods used to define the USEPA's ecoregions are given in Omernik (1995), Omernik
  and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989). The level IV ecoregions were compiled
  at a scale of 1:250,000 and depict revisions and subdivisions of earlier level III
  ecoregions that were originally compiled at a smaller scale (USEPA 2002; Omernik
  1987). In this data layer, states where ecoregions have not yet been subdivided
  to level IV are represented collaborative project primarily between USEPA Regions,
  USEPA National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (Corvallis,
  Oregon), United States Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation
  Service (NRCS, the United States Department of Agriculture-Forest Service (USFS),
  United States Department of the Interior-Geological Survey (USGS)-Earth Resources
  Observation Systems (EROS) Data Center, and with multiple state environmental and
  natural resource agencies. The project is associated with an interagency effort
  to develop a common framework of ecological regions (McMahon and others, 2001).
  Reaching that objective requires recognition of the differences in the conceptual
  approaches and mapping methodologies applied to develop the most common ecoregion-type
  frameworks, including those developed by the USFS (Bailey and others, 1994), the
  Conservation Service, 1981). As each of these frameworks is further refined, their
  differences are becoming less discernible. Regional collaborative projects, where
  some agreement has been reached among multiple resource management agencies, are
  a step toward attaining consensus and consistency in ecoregion frameworks for the
  entire nation. For additional information, contact James M. Omernik, U.S. EPA National
