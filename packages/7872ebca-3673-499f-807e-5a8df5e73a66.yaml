  coastal scenario, risks and development of coastal paleoclimatology through landscape
  mapping; by highlighting the devastating climate change impacts that might result
  in tsunami in South-East Asian sea basin with short or no-awareness period; despite
  the facts that the Southeast Asia region is generally poor being encompassed by
  twelve countries along with the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Special payable concern
  to the Bay of Bengal has been paid that can dictate regionu2019s climate to certain
  extent. The ecosystemsu2019 impact due to climate change and global warming -can
  bring direct variables and affects in u2013salinity, temperature, river flow, runoff,
  soil characteristics, erosion, nutrition level and water quality. The landscape
  mapping can address the system infrastructure requirements to the SEARu2019s sea
  basin attainable by the annual monsoons, the Southwest and the Northeast Monsoons.
  How recent meteorological and geodynamic-genetic events can result in adverse economical
  damages and significant losses of lives are also drawn. This work monitors on Sea-level
  rise gets projected under global warming. The most brainstorming findings from climate
  change issues are how the high latitudes for SEAR Sea Basinsu2019 are likely to
  experience greater warming than the global mean and warming,- And how the hydrological
  cycle gets found responsible for bringing more floods and more droughts in- causing
  huge devastating changes for environmental factors in coastal zones\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
