    One file provides ground-based biophysical measurements and above-ground net primary
    productivity (ANPP) estimates for 31 black spruce (Picea mariana) and 30 quaking
    aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands in Superior National Forest (SNF) in northeastern
    Minnesota, U.S.A. (-92 W 48 N). The measurements were obtained during a 1983-1984
    intensive field campaign. Non-destructive measurements were made in over 100 forest
    plots covering a 50 x 50 km area. Trees sacrificed for biomass and annual increment
    measurements were taken outside the plots. The second file provides climate data
    from nearby weather stations for the period 1976-1986. The data set provides stand
    structural measurements (diameter at breast height, tree height, crown depth, and
    stem density), above-ground biomass, leaf area index, bark area index, and ANPP
    estimates. ANPP data are based on a combination of allometric relationships and
    annual tree-ring (radial) increments for the 5-year period 1979-1983. In the spruce
    stands, above-ground biomass ranged from 700-15,100 g/m2, LAI varied between 0.5-4.3,
    and ANPP ranged from 39-572 g/m2/yr. In comparison, above-ground biomass among aspen
    stands ranged from 600-22,000 g/m2, LAI varied between 1.3-4.0, and ANPP ranged
    from 213-1,199 g/m2/yr. The purpose of the SNF campaign was to investigate the ability
    of remote sensing to provide estimates of ecosystem biophysical properties. In addition
    to the results presented herein, satellite, aircraft, and helicopter observations
    and other ground measurements for the study sites are available from the ORNL DAAC
    Superior National Forest (SNF) Project web site [http://daac.ornl.gov/SNF/snf.shtml].
    Revision Notes: Only the documentation for this data set has been modified. The
    data files have been checked for accuracy and are identical to those originally
    published in 1997. ",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
