    of this project:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Demonstration of 1600-element Kinetic
    Inductance Detector (KID) imaging array operating at 350 micron with near background-limited
    sensitivity, a critical development step for the Short Wavelength Camera (SWCam)
    on CCAT;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Demonstration of 400-element KID imaging array
    operating at 850 micron with near background-limited sensitivity, also a critical
    development step for CCAT cameras;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) Phase-contrast wavefront
    sensing at 850 micron with improved sensitivity and accuracy, targeting the eventual
    measurement of the CCAT telescope surface.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The
    current worldwide state-of-the art for submillimeter imaging detectors is the U.K.&amp;rsquo;s
    SCUBA2 instrument, which has 5000 Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) detectors each at
    450 and 850 micron. TES&amp;rsquo;s work well, but may have reached practical limits
    for a ground-based project in part due to the high detector cost (&amp;gt; $100/pixel).&amp;nbsp;
    KIDs, on the other hand, should achieve a detector cost of &amp;lt;$10/pixel in
    the medium term and are therefore the baseline for CCAT&amp;rsquo;s short-wavelength
    camera SWCam, which requires 50,000 detectors. KIDs&lt;br /&gt;manufactured at JPL
    have shown background-limited performance in the lab at 350 micron, and a 400-element
    first-generation prototype was tested at CSO in April 2013 (see Figure) with promising
    results. The SWCam detectors operate by absorbing radiation directly in the inductive
    element of a TiN film and are fabricated by remarkably simple lithography. 350 micron
    is the key band for CCAT, and the SWCam detector work to date has concentrated on
    this band.&amp;nbsp; By re-optimizing the detailed design according to the operating
    background power, KIDs can work at fundamental background-limited sensitivity limits
    over a wide range of applications. Given that 850 micron is also an important band
    for CCAT, we propose to test an 850 micron imaging KID array at CSO in FY14.&lt;br
    /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In FY12 and FY13, JPL and Caltech demonstrated the first (to our
    knowledge) implementation of phase-contrast (or Zernike) wavefront sensing applied
    to a submillimeter telescope (see Figure). In this approach, the detector images
    the power distribution incident on the pupil (primary mirror), and the phase of
    the field from a point source is modulated in the image plane in order to map the
    wavefront in the pupil plane. The resolution in the wavefront mapping improves as
    the number of imaging elements available grows. The testing demonstrated basic operation
    of the wavefront sensor, with induced ~&amp;pi;/4 wavefront shifts over ~3&#37;
    of the telescope surface detectable in a few minutes. This testing has been done
    so far at 850 micron with the (aging) SHARC2 instrument that was not originally
    designed for operation at that wavelength. One should be able to do much better
    with an improved detector.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
