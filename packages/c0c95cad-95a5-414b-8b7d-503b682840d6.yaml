    depicts depth values (mean 5 meter gridded) collected using LiDAR (Light Detection
    & Ranging) from the shoreline of southwestern Puerto Rico to the shelf edge. The
    Tenix LADS Corporation (TLI) acquired bathymetric LIDAR for NOAA from 4/07/2006
    to 5/15/2006. Data was acquired with a LADS (Laser Airborne Depth Sounder) Mk II
    Airborne System from altitudes between 1,200 and 2,200ft at ground speeds between
    140 and 175 knots. The 900 Hertz Nd: YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet)
    laser (1064 nm) acquired 4x4 meter spot spacing and 200% seabed coverage. This data
    set also contains LiDAR (Light Detection & Ranging) intensity values (mean 5 meter
    gridded) from the shoreline of southwestern Puerto Rico to about 50 meters in depth.
    Reflectivity was calculated for each sounding as the ratio of returned energy to
    transmitted energy, normalized for losses in a single wavelength (green/blue 532nm).
    The numerical values for the relative reflectivity are scaled logarithmically to
    an 8-bit integer range 0 - 255 In total, 265 square nautical miles of LiDAR were
    collected between -50 m (topographic) and up to 70 m (depth), requiring a total
    of 102 flight hours (134 hours, including flight time to and from San Juan airport).
    Environmental factors such as wind strength and direction, cloud cover, and water
    clarity influenced the area of data acquisition on a daily basis. The data was processed
    using the LADS Mk II Ground System and data visualization, quality control and final
    products were created using CARIS HIPS and SIPS 6.1 and CARIS BASE Editor 2.1 The
    project was conducted to meet the IHO (International Hydrographic Organization)
    Order 1 accuracy standards, dependent on the project area and depth. All users should
    individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs
    and standards. The data were received by the NOAA Office for Coastal Management
    from NCCOS. For data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes the data were
    converted: 1. From MLLW depths to NAVD88 heights using Vdatum and then from NAVD88
    heights to Ellipsoid heights using Geoid12a. 2. From UTM Zone 19, meters, NAD83
    to geographic coordinates. 3. From no point classification to 11 (NOAA OCM bathymetry
    classification). Under contract to the National Ocean Service, TLI collected airborne
    LiDAR bathymetry under Contract Number DG133C-03-CQ-0011, Task Order T0008 and Project
