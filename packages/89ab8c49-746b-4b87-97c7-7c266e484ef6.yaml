    is the result of a multifaceted effort described below. The intent of this work
    is five fold: 1) To spatially characterize and monitor the distribution, abundance,
    and size of both reef fishes and macro-invertebrate (conch, lobster, Diadema); 2)
    To relate this information to in-situ data collected on associated benthic composition
    parameters; 3) To use this information to establish the knowledge base necessary
    for enacting management decisions in a spatial setting; 4) To establish the efficacy
    of those management decisions; and 5) To work with the National Coral Reef Monitoring
    Program to develop data collection standards and easily implemented methodologies
    for transference to other agencies and to work toward standardizing data collection
    throughout the US states and territories. Toward this end, the Center for Coastal
    Monitoring and Assessment's Biogeography Branch (BB) has been conducting research
    in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands since 2000 and 2001, respectively. It is
    critical, with recent changes in management at both locations (e.g. implementation
    of MPAs) as well as proposed changes (e.g. zoning to manage multiple human uses)
    that action is taken now to accurately describe and characterize the fish/macro-invertebrate
    populations in these areas. It is also important that BB work closely with the individuals
    responsible for recommending and implementing these management strategies. Recognizing
    this, BB has been collaborating with partners at the University of Puerto Rico,
    National Park Service, US Geological Survey and the Virgin Islands Department of
    Planning and Natural Resources.To quantify patterns of spatial distribution and
    make meaningful interpretations, we must first have knowledge of the underlying
    variables determining species distribution. The basis for this work therefore, is
    the nearshore benthic habitats maps (less than 100 ft depth) created by NOAA's Biogeography
    Program in 2001 and NOS' bathymetry models. Using ArcView GIS software, the digitized
    habitat maps are stratified to select sampling stations. Sites are randomly selected
    within these strata to ensure coverage of the entire study region and not just a
    particular reef or seagrass area. At each site, fish, macro-invertebrates, and benthic
    composition information is then quantified following standardized protocols. By
    relating the data collected in the field back to the habitat maps and bathymetric
    models, BB is able to model and map species level and community level information.
    These protocols are standardized throughout the US Caribbean to enable quantification
    and comparison of reef fish abundance and distribution trends between locations.
    Armed with the knowledge of where "hot spots" of species richness and diversity
    are likely to occur in the seascape, the BB is in a unique position to answer questions
    about the efficacy of marine zoning strategies (e.g. placement of no fishing, anchoring,
    or snorkeling locations), and what locations are most suitable for establishing
    MPAs. Knowledge of the current status of fish/macro-invertebrate communities coupled
    with longer term monitoring will enable evaluation of management efficacy, thus
    it is essential to future management actions.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
