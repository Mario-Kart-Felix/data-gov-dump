    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience

    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "While continuously increasing in complexity,
    the payloads of terrestrial high altitude balloons need a thermal management system
    to reject their waste heat and to maintain a stable temperature as the air (sink)
    temperature swings from as cold as -90&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C to as hot as +40&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C.
     Currently, constant conductance, copper-methanol heat pipes are utilized on balloon
    payloads to remove the waste heat. It would be desirable to use a Variable Conductance
    Heat Pipe (VCHP) instead, to allow the thermal resistance to increase under cold
    operating or cold survival environment conditions, keeping the instrument section
    warm.  In spacecraft, thermal management is achieved using axially-grooved aluminum-ammonia
    heat pipes and VCHPs, which are relatively expensive to manufacture and validate.
      Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) is proposing a low-cost VCHP based
    on smooth-bore, thin-wall stainless steel tubing, with either methanol or pentane
    as working fluids, that is capable of passively maintaining a relatively constant
    evaporator (payload) temperature while the sink temperature varies between -90&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C
    and +40&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C.  The thin wall will be much lighter and will provide
    much better temperature control due to its higher thermal resistance, while the
    combination of working fluid and envelope material result in a heat pipe that is
    much less expensive to manufacture than standard grooved aluminum heat pipes. Spacecraft
    VCHPs normally have the gas reservoir at the end of the condenser, and maintain
    its temperature with electrical heaters.  The proposed VCHP moves the reservoir
    near the evaporator, eliminating the need for electrical  power to control the temperature.
     Preliminary calculations show that either system, methanol based or pentane based,
    is capable of meeting the thermal performance requirements. For both the pentane
    and methanol systems, the evaporator (payload) temperature varies less than 6&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C
    while the heat sink temperature varies from  90&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C to +40&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C.
