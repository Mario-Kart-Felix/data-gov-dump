    sanitation sub activity will be measured using a rigorous quasi-experimental impact
    evaluation methodology. An impact evaluation is a study that measures the changes
    in outcomes that measure aspects of wellbeing which can be attributed to a specific
    intervention. Impact evaluations require a credible and rigorously defined counterfactual,
    which estimates what would have happened to the beneficiaries absent the project.
    Estimated impacts, when contrasted with total related costs, provide an assessment
    of the intervention's cost-effectiveness.nnThe evaluator divided the primary evaluation
    questions in different categories: welfare indicators, coping cost in cash and time,
    health, education, reliability and quality of service, spillover effects. In addition,
    we allow for differential impacts in gender and social groups for these main outcomes.nnHousehold
    welfare no Do water and sanitation infrastructure investments increase household
    expenditure or income? What factors might explain the impact (or lack of impact)
    in this area?no What are the consequences of water and sanitation investments for
    expenditure patterns?nnCoping costs and cash expenditure on waterno Do water and
    sanitation interventions reduce coping costs? What factors might explain the impact
    (or lack of impact) in this area?no Do they reduce cash expenditures on water and
    on sanitation services? What factors might explain the impact (or lack of impact)
    in this area?nnHealth no Do water and sanitation interventions reduce incidence
    of diarrheal illness?no What factors (hygiene behavior, source and household-level
    water quality, household source choice) might explain the impact (or lack of impact)
    in this area?nnEducation no Do water and sanitation interventions increase school
    enrollment among children aged 7 to 12? And children age 6 to 18?  What factors
    might explain the impact (or lack of impact) in this area?no Do water and sanitation
    interventions increase school attendance among children aged 7 to 12? And children
    age 6 to 18? What factors might explain the impact (or lack of impact) in this area?nnService,
    use, and sustainabilityno Were the water and sanitation projects implemented according
    to plan?no Are the results from the activity expected to be sustained over time?no
    Did the MCC investment reach intended/unintended beneficiaries?nnGender and social
    exclusionno Do the effect on health, education and access of water and sanitation
    interventions differ by gender or by expenditure levels (initial conditions)?no
    What factors (hygiene behavior, source and household-level water quality, household
    source choice) might explain the impact (or lack of impact) in a specific subpopulation?nnThe
    key to measuring the impacts caused by the water and sanitation interventions is
    to compare conditions with the interventions to conditions that would have prevailed
    without them. The counterfactual state is not naturally observable - we can never
    know what change would have occurred in program participants (the treatment group)
    if the program were not implemented. As it was not possible to apply randomization
    in the selection of water and sanitation projects in this case, the benefits of
    the water and sanitation projects will be measured with a rigorous quasi-experimental
    design that incorporates matching, pre- and post-implementation data collection,
    difference-in-difference estimation, and econometric analysis to estimate the counterfactual
    and address selection and other biases. This requires selecting a comparison group-households
    that are observationally similar to beneficiary households but do not participate
    in the program-and observing both sets of households before and after the program
    is implemented.n nMatching represents a credible non-experimental option for identifying
    comparison groups. The evaluator uses propensity score matching (PSM) using data
    from the 2007 census to match the treatment communities to comparable communities
    before program implementation. PSM identifies comparison communities that have a
    similar probability of receiving the treatment and are similar to the treatment
    communities in terms of observable characteristics. Accordingly, they provide measures
    of indicators in communities that are similar except for the treatment; thus addressing
    selection on observables.n      ",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras":
