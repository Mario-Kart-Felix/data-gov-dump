    backscatter mosaic of the reef shelf and the steep slopes of the Lang Bank (H12639)
    of St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. The M-I907-NF-14 survey was a continuation of the
    NOAA Biogeography Branch's Seafloor Mapping of the US Caribbean project. NOAA's
    NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster
    and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry
    data in St. Croix between March 12th and April 2, 2014. Data was acquired with a
    hull-mounted Reson 7125 multibeam echosounder (400 kHz) and processed by a NOAA
    contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude,
    sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final
    approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The bathymetry
    data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using Hypack 2014 acquisition
    software. The project was conducted to meet IHO order 1 and 2 accuracy standards,
    dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate
    the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.",nt"license_title":
