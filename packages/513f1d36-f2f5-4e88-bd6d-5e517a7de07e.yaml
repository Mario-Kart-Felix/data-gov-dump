  basedmaintenance(CBM)ofcriticalsystems.Alongwith developing the fundamentals of
  being able to confidently predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL), the technology calls
  for fielded applications as it inches towards maturation. This requires a stringent
  performance evaluation so that the significance of the concept can be fully exploited.
  Currently, prognostics concepts lack standard definitions and suffer from ambiguous
  and inconsistent interpretations. This lack of standards is in part due to the varied
  end-user requirements for different applications, time scales, available information,
  domain dynamics, etc. to name a few issues. Instead, the research community has
  used a variety of metrics based largely on convenience with respect to their respective
  requirements. Very little attention has been focused on establishing a common ground
  to compare different efforts. This paper surveys the metrics that are already used
  for prognostics in a variety of domains including medicine, nuclear, automotive,
  aerospace, and electronics. It also considers other domains that involve prediction-related
  tasks, such as weather and finance. Differences and similarities between these domains
  and health maintenancehave been analyzed to help understand what performance evaluation
  methods may or may not be borrowed. Further, these metrics have been categorized
  in several ways that may be useful in deciding upon a suitable subset for a specific
  application. Some important prognostic concepts have been defined using a notational
  framework that enables interpretation of different metrics coherently. Last, but
  not the least, a list of metrics has been suggested to assess critical aspects of
  RUL predictions before they are fielded in real applications.\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
