    (.txt format). One data file contains above-ground biomass, litter, litterfall,
    herbivory, biomass change, and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) estimates
    for a late secondary moist subtropical forest based on measurements from 16 permanent
    study plots located along an elevational (60-290 m) and topological gradient within
    the 132-ha Cinnamon Bay watershed on St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands. The purpose
    of the study was to provide information on forest structure, species composition,
    and forest productivity along environmental gradients, including the effects of
    hurricanes and drought. The other two files provide climate records from nearby
    weather stations (1917-1981).Above-ground biomass was measured every 5 years (1983-2003).
    Litterfall accumulation was determined in 1992-1993. In 1983, total above-ground
    biomass on all plots combined averaged 13,870 g/m2; by 2003 during a post-hurricane
    recovery period, it had declined by nearly 7 percent. In 1983, biomass was greatest
    on the summit, intermediate on slopes and valleys, and least on ridges; by 2003,
    the quantities for all sites had converged except on the summit plot.In 1992, ANPP
    was estimated based on annual litterfall accumulation (897 g/m2/year) plus biomass
    change due to delayed mortality (142 g/m2/year) plus estimated herbivory (25 g/m2/year),
    giving a total ANPP of 1,064 g/m2/year. Periodic storms and drought appear to maintain
    the forest in a disturbed state.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
