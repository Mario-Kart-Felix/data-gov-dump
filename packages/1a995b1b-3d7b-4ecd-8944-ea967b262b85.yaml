    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Returning a geological sample from the surface
    of Mars will require an ascent propulsion system with a comparatively large velocity
    change (delta-V) capability due to the relatively deep Martian gravity well. Consequently,
    a significant propellant mass will be required. Bringing that mass from Earth, while
    technically possible, would be impractical and grossly inefficient. Manufacturing
    propellant from the Martian atmosphere would be far more practical. Highly efficient
    electrolyzers for splitting carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen
    (O2) have been demonstrated. These can be run off solar power and used to generate
    high-pressure propellant without the need for pumps. With a theoretical vacuum specific
    impulse (Isp) of 324 sec (1000 psia chamber pressure, 40:1 nozzle expansion ratio),
    an O2/CO propulsion system would provide higher Isp than a solid rocket, and only
    a small fraction of the propulsion system wet mass would have to be brought from
    Earth. Previous testing with O2/CO propellant at NASA GRC has demonstrated that
    ignition of this mixture is very difficult. In that work, spark igniters were used,
    and every test resulted in a catastrophic detonation and damage to equipment. In
    this project, Ultramet will develop a high-performance ignition system for use with
    O2/CO propellant that is based on resistively heated silicon carbide open-cell foam.
    Previous testing has demonstrated that by passing an electric current through it,
    the foam can be heated to 1300 C in just 2 seconds. By flowing the non-hypergolic
    bipropellant mixture through the foam, ignition will take place in a pseudo-homogeneous
    manner as the gases enter the foam rather than only in the isolated vicinity of
    the arc in a spark igniter. This will prevent propellant accumulation in the chamber
    and subsequent detonation. Safe, reliable ignition of O2/CO is an enabling technology
    for the use of in-situ manufactured propellants on Mars.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
