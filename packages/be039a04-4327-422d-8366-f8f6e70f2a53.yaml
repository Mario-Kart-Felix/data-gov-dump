    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;Armstrong researchers are continuing
    their efforts to further develop FOSS technologies. A hybrid FOSS technique (HyFOSS)
    employs conventional continuous grating fibers and then overlays sections every
    3-4 feet with &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo; gratings that can be sampled at higher
    rates. The new and stronger gratings can be sampled at rates up to 5,000 Hertz (Hz)
    while the continuous grating sections continue to be sampled at the lower 100 Hz
    rate. This technique enables higher spatial resolution at specific targets without
    sacrificing resolution in other areas. The ultimate goal is to achieve sampling
    rates up to 20 kHz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work to date&lt;/strong&gt;:
    The team began investigating the technique in early 2013 after a request from NASA
    Kennedy Space Center. Many aerospace and space vehicles &amp;ndash; fighter aircraft,
    UAVs, launch vehicles, and spacecraft &amp;ndash; could benefit from FOSS integration.
    Some of the applications require higher sample rates to maintain high spatial resolution.
    NASA Kennedy&amp;rsquo;s Launch Services Group requested that the NASA Armstrong
    Advanced Structures and Measurements Group investigate the development effort that
    would be required to increase the sample rate from 100 hertz (Hz) to over 20 kHz.
    This increased sampling capability would allow structural features related to high
    frequency shock and/or vibration to be captured. To date, the OFDR technology does
    not have the capability to achieve these higher sample rates, though the possibility
    of fusing Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is feasible yet with limited spatial
    resolution. To achieve this with existing instrumentation would require the installation
    of two technologies, one utilizing OFDR and the other using WDM, and would increase
    the weight and installation requirement of fiber optic instrumentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining
    the best of OFDR and WDM technologies into new hardware that utilizes the same optical
    fiber would allow for high spatial resolution with lower sample rates in addition
    to the ability to obtain high sample rates at strategically spaced points along
    the fiber. With this goal, the hybrid FOSS (hyFOSS) system was developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A
    series of weak and strong FBGs are written onto the optical fiber. Weak FBGs allow
    for spatial resolution of 0.25 inches. The maximum number of stronger, unique-wavelength
    FBGs and the minimum separation interval between the sensors are determined by the
    length of the fiber and the wavelength spectrum of the light source. However, there
    is latitude to allow for the number and placement of the sensors to be tailored
    to the testing application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/strong&gt;:
    Researchers have asked the company that currently provides the fibers to supply
    a 40-ft strand embedded with the new technology. Next steps involving investigating
    the specimen in the laboratory environment. The Armstrong team is also investigating
    the possibilities of pushing the overall sample rate to 20kHz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benefits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More
    measurements&lt;/strong&gt;: Offers higher sampling rates (up to 5,000 Hz) for specific
    portions of the fiber&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast processing&lt;/strong&gt;:
    Data can be collected at different resolutions enabling high resolution without
    sacrificing speed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aeronautics

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
