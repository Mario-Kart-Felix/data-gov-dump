    Wildlife Service between 1985 and 1988 to obtain baseline trace element and water
    quality data on water, sediments, and fish in rivers of the Nowitna National Wildlife
    Refuge and to assess the impacts of upstream placer mining activities. One river
    examined, the Sulatna River, had active placer mining on its tributaries. In addition,
    California Creek, a tributary to the Titna River, experienced upstream placer mining
    from 1979 - 1986. In the early 1900's, Our Creek, and the Susulatna River, tributaries
    to the upper Nowitna River, were mined, as was an unnamed tributary to the Sulukna
    River. The Sulatna River experienced significantly higher turbidity, iron, and manganese
    concentrations than sites on the upper, middle, or lower Nowitna River, the Sulukna
    River, or California Creek. The Tima River, only sampled in 1985, also had extremely
    high iron concentrations in the water. In other respects, the water quality of all
    sites was similar. Copper appears to be slightly elevated in water from all sites
    as a result of natural conditions, but meets water quality standards. However, concentrations
    were in the range of potential effects on young arctic grayling and other sensitive
    species. No significant differences were found between sites in sediment trace element
    concentrations, except for mercury. Mercury concentrations were higher in Sulama
    River sediments than at other sites, but occurred at elevated concentrations at
    all sample sites except California Creek. Fish tissue concentrations of mercury
    were highest in northern pike from the unmined Sulukna River. Concentrations in
    all five northern pike collected in 1987 exceeded the Food and Drug Administration
    (FDA) action level of 1 mg/kg wet weight. Northern pike from the mouth of the Nowima
    River also contained elevated mercury concentrations, but concentrations did not
    exceed the FDA limit. Shellfish and arctic grayling were generally low in mercury
    concentration in comparison to the northern pike. The source of mercury in the Nowima
    Refuge fish is uncertain, but is most likely derived from natural sources, rather
    than placer mining activity. Mercury, used historically to amalgamate gold and discharged
    to waters, is another potential, but less likely, source. Mercury concentrations
    in northern pike were not correlated with fish length, weight, or condition index,
    suggesting that mercury concentrations did not affect fish health. The only negative
    statistical correlations found between northern pike measurements and metal concentrations
    were between liver copper, weight, and total length. Due to small sample sizes involved
    in this study, few conclusions should be drawn regarding the relationship of metal
    concentrations in fish and fish health at this time. The paucity of northern pike
    from the- mined Sulama River also precludes conclusions regarding the effect of
    mining on fish tissue concentrations. Other species were collected in too few numbers
    to conduct between-site comparisons. Additional studies are recommended to identify
    source areas of mercury, and to better define tissue concentrations in potentially
    affected biota.",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras":
