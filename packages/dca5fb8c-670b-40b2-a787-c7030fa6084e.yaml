    ever changing and complex engineering system. As the Next Generation Air Transportation
    System (NextGen) is developed, there will be an increased emphasis on safety and
    operational and environmental efficiency. Current operations in the NAS arernmonitored
    using a variety of data sources, including data from flight recorders, radar track
    data, weather data, and other massive data collection systems. Although numerous
    technologies exist tornmonitor the frequency of known but undesirable behaviors
    in the NAS, there are currently few methods that can analyze the large repositories
    to discover new and previously unknown events in the NAS. Having a tool to discover
    events that have implications for safety or incidents of operational importance,
    increases the awareness of such scenarios in the community and helps to broaden
    the overall safety of the NAS, whereas only monitoring the frequency of known events
    can only provide mitigations for already established problems. This paper discusses
    a novel approach for discovering operationally significant events in the NAS that
    are currently not monitored and have potential safetyrnand/or efficiency implications
    using radar-track data. This paper will discuss the discovery algorithm and describe
    in detail some flights of interest with comments from subject matter experts who
    are familiar with the operations in the airspace that was studied.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
