  Models or DEMs) of Padre Island National Seashore were produced from remotely-sensed,
  geographically-referenced elevation measurements in cooperation with NASA and NPS.
  Point data in ascii text files were interpolated in a GIS to create a grid or digital
  elevation model (DEM) of each beach surface. Elevation measurements were collected
  in Texas, over Padre Island National Seashore, using the NASA Experimental Advanced
  Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL), a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an
  aircraft to measure ground elevation and coastal topography. The system uses high
  frequency laser beams directed at the earth's surface through an opening in the
  bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference
  between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal
  in the aircraft. The plane travels over the beach at approximately 60 meters per
  second while surveying from the low-water line to the landward base of the sand
  dunes. The EAARL, developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
  (NASA) located at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, measures ground elevation
  with a vertical resolution of 15 centimeters. A sampling rate of 3 kHz or higher
  results in an extremely dense spatial elevation data set. Over 100 kilometers of
  coastline can be easily surveyed within a 3- to 4-hour mission time period. The
  ability to sample large areas rapidly and accurately is especially useful in morphologically
  dynamic areas such as barrier beaches. Quick assessment of topographic change can
  be made following storms comparing measurements against baseline data. When subsequent
  elevation maps for an area are analyzed, they provide a useful tool to make management
  decisions regarding coastal development. For more information on Lidar science and
  the Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL) system and surveys, see
