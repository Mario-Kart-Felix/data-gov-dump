    was collected daily (at approximately 1000 hrs EST - but see note below in section
    1.2.3 Supplemental Information) at a depth of 0.5 meter below the water's surface
    at three sites in the North Inlet salt marsh tidal creeks: Town Creek, Clambank,
    and Crab Haul (at the end of the Oyster Landing dock). The water samples were analyzed
    for chlorophyll a, phaeophytin, nitrogen (total whole and dissolved, ammonia, nitrate-nitrite),
    phosphorus (total and dissolved and ortho phosphate), organic carbon [total (TOC),
    dissolved (DOC), particulate (POC)], suspended sediment [Total Suspended Sediment
    (TSS), Inorganic Suspended Sediment (ISS), Organic Suspended Sediment (OSS)], and
    suspended sediment color. Tide level or water level (see note below in Supplemental
    Information), water temperature, secchi depth were noted in the field at the time
    of the water collection; salinity was measured when the sample was brought into
    the laboratory for processing. From 1977 to 1986, ATP analyzes were also run on
    the samples but are not part of this database. From 1985 to 1988 water chemistry
    analysis (listed above) were run on water samples from Debidue Creek, but are not
    included as part of this database. Using the Munsell Soil Chart, sediment color
    was determined for each suspended sediment filter starting in June 1988; this database
    is an ancillary database and is available for use.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
