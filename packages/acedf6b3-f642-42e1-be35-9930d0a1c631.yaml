    & Ranging) intensity mosaic (mean 5 meter gridded) from the shoreline of southwestern
    Puerto Rico to about 50 meters in depth. Reflectivity was calculated for each sounding
    as the ratio of returned energy to transmitted energy, normalized for losses in
    a single wavelength (green/blue 532nm). The numerical values for the relative reflectivity
    are scaled logarithmically to an 8-bit integer range 0 - 255 The Tenix LADS Corporation
    (TLI) acquired bathymetric LIDAR for NOAA from 4/07/2006 to 5/15/2006. Data was
    acquired with a LADS (Laser Airborne Depth Sounder) Mk II Airborne System from altitudes
    between 1,200 and 2,200ft at ground speeds between 140 and 175 knots. The 900 Hertz
    Nd: YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet) laser (1064 nm) acquired 4x4 meter
    spot spacing and 200% seabed coverage. In total, 265 square nautical miles of LiDAR
    were collected between -50 m (topographic) and up to 70 m (depth), requiring a total
    of 102 flight hours (134 hours, including flight time to and from San Juan airport).
    Environmental factors such as wind strength and direction, cloud cover, and water
    clarity influenced the area of data acquisition on a daily basis. The data was processed
    using the LADS Mk II Ground System and data visualization, quality control and final
    products were created using CARIS HIPS and SIPS 6.1 and CARIS BASE Editor 2.1 The
    project was conducted to meet the IHO (International Hydrograph Organization) Order
    1 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should
    individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs
