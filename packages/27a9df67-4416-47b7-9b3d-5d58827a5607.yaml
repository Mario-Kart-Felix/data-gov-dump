    purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase includes: 1) Geographic
    boundaries of public land ownership and voluntarily provided private conservation
    lands (e.g., Nature Conservancy Preserves); 2) The combination land owner, land

    to land management activities. The PAD-US geodatabase is required to organize and

    and plant communities not adequately represented in existing conservation lands.
    Common species are those not currently threatened with extinction. By identifying
    their habitats, Gap Analysis gives land managers and policy makers the information

    States (PAD-US) is a geodatabase, managed by U. S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis
    Program, that illustrates and describes public land ownership, management and other
    conservation lands, including voluntarily provided privately protected areas. The
    geodatabase contains four feature classes such as, Marine Protected Areas (MPA)
    and Easements that each contains uniquely associated attributes. These two feature
    classes are combined with the PAD-US Fee feature class to provide a full inventory
    of protected areas in a common schema (i.e. Combined file). Legitimate and other
    protected area overlaps exist in the full inventory, with Easements loaded on top
    of Fee and MPAs under both. Parcel data within a protected area are dissolved in
    this file that powers the PAD-US Viewer. As overlaps exist, GAP creates separate
    analytical layers to summarize area statistics for "GAP Status Code" and "Owner
    Name". Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for more information. The lands included
    in PAD-US are assigned conservation measures that qualify their intent to manage
    lands for the preservation of biological diversity and to other natural, recreational
    and cultural uses; managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means.
    The geodatabase includes: 1) Geographic boundaries of public land ownership and
    voluntarily provided private conservation lands (e.g., Nature Conservancy Preserves);
    2) The combination land owner, land manager, management designation or type, parcel
    name, GIS Acres and source of geographic information of each mapped land unit 3)
    GAP Status Code conservation measure of each parcel based on USGS National Gap Analysis
    Program (GAP) protection level categories which provide a measurement of management
    intent for long-term biodiversity conservation 4) IUCN category for a protected
    area's inclusion into UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre's World Database
    for Protected Areas. IUCN protected areas are defined as, "A clearly defined geographical
    space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means,
    to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services
    and cultural values" and are categorized following a classification scheme available
    through USGS GAP; 5) World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA) Site Codes linking
    the multiple parcels of a single protected area in PAD-US and connecting them to
    the Global Community. The geodatabase contains a Marine Protected Area (MPA) feature
    class and Easements feature class, each with uniquely associated attribute. These
    two feature classes are combined with the PAD-US fee feature class with standard
    PAD-US attributes to provide a full inventory of protected areas in a common schema.
    As legitimate and other overlaps exist in the combined inventory GAP creates separate
    analytical layers to obtain area statistics for "GAP Status Code" and "Owner
    Name". PAD-US version 1.3 Combined updates include: 1) State, local government
    and private protected area updates delivered September 2011 from PAD-US State Data
    Stewards: CO (Colorado State University), FL (Florida Natural Areas Inventory),
    ID (Idaho Fish and Game), MA (The Commonwealth's Office of Geographic Information
    Systems, MassGIS), MO (University of Missouri, MoRAP), MT (Montana Natural Heritage
    Program), NM (Natural Heritage New Mexico), OR (Oregon Natural Heritage Program),
    VA (Department of Conservation and Recreation, Virginia Natural Heritage Program).
    2) Select local government (i.e. county, city) protected areas (3,632) across the
    country (to complement the current PAD-US inventory) aggregated by the Trust for
    Public Land (TPL) for their Conservation Almanac that tracks the conservation finance
    movement across the country. 3) A new Date of Establishment field that identifies
    the year an area was designated or otherwise protected, attributed for 86% of GAP
    Status Code 1 and 2 protected areas. Additional dates will be provided in future
    updates. 4) A national wilderness area update from wilderness.net 5) The Access
    field that describes public access to protected areas as defined by data stewards
    or categorical assignment by Primary Designation Type. . The new Access Source field
    documents local vs. categorical assignments. See the PAD-US Standard Manual for
    more information: gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus 6) The transfer of conservation measures
    (i.e. GAP Status Codes, IUCN Categories) and documentation (i.e. GAP Code Source,
    GAP Code Date) from PAD-US version 1.2 or categorical assignments (see PAD-US Standard)
    when not provided by data stewards 7) Integration of non-sensitive National Conservation
    Easement Database (NCED) easements from August 2011, July 2012 with PAD-US version
    1.2 easements. Duplicates were removed, unless 'Stacked' = Y and multiple easements
    exist. 8) Unique ID's transferred from NCED or requested for new easements. NCED
    and PAD-US are linked via Source UID in the PAD-US version 1.3 Easement feature
    class. 9) Official (member and eligible) MPAs from the NOAA MPA Inventory (March
    2011, http://marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov/) translated into the PAD-US schema with
    conservation measures transferred from PAD-US version 1.2 or categorically assigned
    to new protected areas. Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for documentation of categorical
    GAP Status Code assignments for MPAs. 10) Identified MPA records that overlap existing
    protected areas in the PAD-US Fee feature class (i.e. PADUS Overlap field in MPA
    feature class). For example, many National Wildlife Refuges and National Parks are
    also MPAs and are represented in the PAD-US MPA and Fee feature classes.",nt"license_title":

    needed, and for uses with a regulatory outcome, field surveys should verify the
    result. In the end, it will be the responsibility of each data user to determine
    if these data can answer the question being asked, and if they are the best tool

    there is a "fuzzy line" that is eventually crossed when the differences in resolution
    of the data, size of geographic area being analyzed, and precision of the answer
    required for the question are no longer compatible. Examples include: -Using the
    data to map small areas (less than thousands of hectares), typically requiring mapping
    resolution at 1:24,000 scale and using aerial photographs or ground surveys. -Combining
    these data with other data finer than 1:100,000 scale to produce new hybrid maps
    or answer queries. -Generating specific areal measurements from the data finer than
    the nearest thousand hectares -Establishing exact boundaries for regulation or acquisition.
    -Establishing definite occurrence or non-occurrence of any feature for an exact
    geographic area -Determining abundance, health, or condition of any feature. -Establishing
    a measure of accuracy of any other data by comparison with GAP data. -Altering the
    data in any way and redistributing them as a GAP data product. -Using the data without
    acquiring and reviewing the metadata and this report.", "Access Constraints: These
