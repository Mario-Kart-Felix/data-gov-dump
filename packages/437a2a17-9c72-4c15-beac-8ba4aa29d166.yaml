  true,\n\t\"url\": null,\n\t\"notes\": \"&lt;p&gt;The motivation for this technology
  comes from the Heliophysics Decadal Survey. The Heliophysics Decadal Survey, Section
  10.5.2.7 states in part; &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; recent in situ measurements by
  the Voyagers, combined with all-sky heliospheric images from IBEX and Cassini, have
  made outer-heliospheric science one of the most exciting and fastest-developing
  fields of heliophysics... The proposed Interstellar Probe Mission would make comprehensive,
  state-of-the-art, in situ measurements&amp;hellip;required for understanding the
  nature of the outer heliosphere and exploring our local galactic environment.&amp;rdquo;
  It goes on to say, &amp;ldquo;The main technical hurdle is propulsion. Advanced
  propulsion options should aim to reach the Heliopause considerably faster than Voyager
  1 (3.6 AU/year)&amp;hellip; It has high priority for the Solar and Heliospheric
  Physics (SHP) Panel that NASA develops the necessary propulsion technology for visionary
  missions like The Solar Polar Imager (SPI) and Interstellar Probe to enable the
  vision in the coming decades.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept proposed
  herein has been named the Heliopause Electrostatic Rapid Transit System (HERTS)
  by the MSFC proposing team. The HERTS is a revolutionary propellant-less propulsion
  concept that is ideal for deep space missions to the outer planets, Heliopause,
  and beyond. It is unique in that it uses momentum exchange from naturally occurring
  solar wind protons to propel a spacecraft within the heliosphere. The propulsion
  system consists of an array of electrically biased wires that extend outward 10
  to 30 km from a rotating spacecraft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea has been explored
  and recently published in the open literature&amp;mdash;primarily by Pekka Janhunen
  of the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI). This past year, MSFC&amp;rsquo;s
  Advanced Concepts Office (ACO) performed a top level feasibility study of this concept
  and determined that the HERTS system can accelerate a spacecraft to velocities as
  much as three to four times that possible by any realistic extrapolation of current
  state-of-the-art propulsion technologies&amp;mdash;including solar electric and
  solar sail propulsion systems. Moreover, it can be reasonably expected that this
  system could be developed within a decade and provide meaningful Heliophysics Science
  in the 2025-2030 timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic principle on which the HERTS
  operates is the exchange of momentum between an array of long electrically biased
  wires and the solar wind protons, which flow radially away from the sun at speeds
  ranging from 300 to 700 km/s. A high-voltage, positive bias on the wires, which
  are oriented normal to the solar wind flow, deflects the streaming protons, resulting
  in a reaction force on the wires&amp;mdash;also directed radially away from the
  sun. Over periods of months, this small force can accelerate the spacecraft to enormous
  speeds&amp;mdash;on the order of 100-150 km/s (~ 20 to 30 AU/year).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
  proposed HERTS can provide the unique ability to explore the Heliopause and the
  extreme outer solar system on timescales of less than a decade. It is significantly
  more effective than any other near-to-mid-term propulsion system for deep space
  missions, meshes well with heliospheric science payloads, and could be implemented
  in the 2025-2030 timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Heliopause Electrostatic Rapid
  Transit System (HERTS) fully supports NASA&amp;rsquo;s vision to &amp;ldquo;lead
  advances in space&amp;rdquo; by providing a revolutionary, in-space propulsion system
  that can open the frontier of Heliophysics to new discovery. With the performance
  and benefits of a HERTS mission, the Heliospheric physics community will have at
  its disposal the ability to carry out Heliophysics missions with one-way Earth to
  Heliopause trip times of less than 10 years. This study is a necessary step between
  a scientific dream and engineering development.&lt;/p&gt;\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
