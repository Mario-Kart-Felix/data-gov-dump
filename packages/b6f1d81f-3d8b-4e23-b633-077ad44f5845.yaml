  of each year.nnSOURCES: IBO; New York City Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
  of the Comptroller (various years); Annual Report of the Comptroller on Capital
  Debt and Obligations (various years); New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority
  Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (various years)nNOTES: 1In determining what
  to include as outstanding debt of the City of New York, IBO considered: (1) the
  city's obligation (contractual and moral) to repay the debt, (2) whether the revenues
  pledged toward the repayment of the debt would have otherwise accrued to the city,
  and (3) whether the proceeds of the debt issuance accrue directly to the city.n2GO
  debt is net of bonds held for debt service on other city-related obligations, referred
  to in the Comptroller's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) as Treasury
  Obligations. The 2000u20132002 CAFRs show outstanding general obligation debt, before
  Treasury Obligations, in 2000 and 2001 as $26,892 million and $26,836 million, respectively.
  However, CAFRs from 2003 on show higher GO debt for the two years, $353 million
  more for 2000 and $311 million more for 2001; the 2003 CAFR does not provide a note
  explaining the revisions. IBO uses the numbers reported from 2003 forward.n3Fiscal
  years 2000, 2002, and 2003 include short-term bond anticipation notes outstanding
  at year-end of $515 million, $2.2 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively.n4For
  fiscal year 2000, Capital Lease Obligations to HHC and PCDC are reported jointly.
  n5In FY 2008, JSDC bonds outstanding were redeemed with GO bond proceeds, resulting
  in the elimination of JSDC debt, a reduction in conduit debt outstanding and partially
  accounting for the increase in GO debt from 2007 to 2008nttttttttttttttnGeneral
  Obligation:nGeneral obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of
  the city. City property tax collections are pledged first to pay the principal and
  interest on these bonds.nttttttttttttttnttttttttttttttnTreasury Obligations:nTreasury
  obligations are New York City bonds held as investments by the city or by the related
  entities covered here, including MAC and SFC. They are netted out in order to avoid
  double counting of the city's obligations.nttttttttttttttnTransitional Finance Authority:nCreated
  in 1997, the Transitional Finance Authority (TFA) is a separate legal entity from
  the City of New York. TFA General Purpose Bonds are secured by the city's collections
  of personal income tax and, if necessary, sales tax.  Recovery Bonds, issued in
  response to the events of September 11, 2001 differ from general purpose bonds in
  that they are excluded from the calculation of outstanding TFA debt allowed under
  the debt limit.nttttttttttttttnTFA Building Aid Revenue Bonds:nIn fiscal year 2006,
  the city was authorized by the state Legislature to assign to the TFA all or any
  portion of the state building aid payable to the city or its school district. The
  TFA in turn is authorized to issue bonds secured by the aid and dedicated to financing
  a portion of the city's educational facilities capital plan.nttttttttttttttnTSASC:nTSASC
  Inc. (formerly known as the Tobacco Settlement Asset Securitization Corporation)
  is a separate legal entity from the City of New York. TSASC bonds are secured by
  the corporation's purchase from the city of the future revenue stream under a settlement
  agreement resolving cigarette smoking-related litigation between the settling states
  and participating manufacturers.nttttttttttttttnMunicipal Assistance Corporation
  for the City of New York:nThe Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) was a separate
  legal entity from the City of New York, created in 1975 and formally dissolved in
  2008. With New York City experiencing a severe fiscal crisis in 1975, MAC allowed
  the city continued access to credit markets and assisted in the prevention of a
  default of city general obligation bonds. MAC bonds were secured by state collections
  of certain sales and compensating use taxes (imposed by the state within the city
  at rates formerly imposed by the city), the stock transfer tax, and certain per
  capita state aid.nttttttttttttttnSamurai Funding Corporation:nThe Samurai Funding
  Corporation (SFC) was a separate legal entity from the City of New York, which issued
  Japanese yen-denominated bonds. The yen-denominated bonds were secured by the proceeds
  of New York City general obligation bonds held by SFC.nttttttttttttttnConduit Debt:nThe
  city makes annual appropriations from its general fund for agreements with other
  entities that issue debt to build or maintain facilities on behalf of the city.
  These agreements are known as \"leaseback\" transactions, where the city makes rental
  payments to the partner entity in an amount sufficient to pay the entity's debt
  service on the securities issued for the respective capital expenditures. These
  entities, though legally separate from the city, either provide services exclusively
  to the city, have governance boards whose majority is appointed by the city, or
  are otherwise subject to the city's imposition of its will on the activities of
  the entity.nttttttttttttttnExcluded Items:nIBO considered several other items for
  inclusion as outstanding debt of the City of New York that were ultimately determined
  not to constitute obligations of the city, including: outstanding bonds of the Fiscal
  Year 2005 Securitization Corporation (FSC), outstanding bonds of the Sales Tax Asset
  Receivable Corporation (STAR), notes of the Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation
  (HYIC), and general capital lease obligations.nttttttttttttttnFSC is a financing
  instrumentality of the city, formed for the purpose of issuing bonds, the proceeds
  of which were used to acquire securities, held in escrow, which economically defeased
  city general obligation bonds. As the general obligation bonds in question are included
  in the calculation of outstanding general obligation debt, the inclusion of the
  FSC bonds as well would constitute a double counting. As such, IBO does not count
  FSC debt outstanding toward total New York City debt outstanding.nttttttttttttttnSTAR
  is a financing instrumentality of the city, formed for the purpose of issuing bonds,
  the proceeds of which were used to assume the remaining obligations of MAC. STAR
  pays the debt service on these bonds with revenues received from the Local Government
  Assistance Corporation, a state entity whose revenues are 1 percent of the statewide
  sales tax. The debt of STAR is not an obligation of the city, and the revenues used
  to pay STAR debt service would not accrue to the city in the corporation's absence.
  As such, IBO does not count STAR debt outstanding toward total New York City debt
  outstanding.nttttttttttttttnHYIC entered into an agreement with the Metropolitan
  Transportation Authority (MTA) to purchase from the MTA Transferrable Development
  Rights.  $200 million of notes were issued by HYIC, the proceeds of which were used
  to execute the transaction. Debt service on the notes was paid from the proceeds
  of the bonds issued by HYIC which are included in IBO's definition of outstanding
  debt under conduit debt.  Therefore, inclusion in outstanding debt of the notes
  in addition to the bonds would constitute a double counting. As such, IBO does not
  count HYIC notes outstanding toward total New York City debt outstanding.nttttttttttttttnIn
  addition to the capital leases deemed to be debt obligations of the city under conduit
  debt, various city agencies have entered into leases that have been determined under
  generally accepted accounting practices to be capital leases. Unlike issuers of
  conduit debt, the lessors of these general lease obligations do not exist to provide
  services exclusively to the city, do not have boards the majority of whose members
  are appointed by the city, or are not otherwise subject to the city's imposition
  of its will on their activities. These general capital lease obligations do not
  constitute an obligation of the city toward any bonds or other borrowing. As such,
  IBO does not count general capital lease obligations toward total New York City
  debt outstanding.n.\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"License Not Specified\",\n\t\"extras\":
