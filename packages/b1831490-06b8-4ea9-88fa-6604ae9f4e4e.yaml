    LAST UPLOADED TO THIS SITE: 2016-10-01<br /><br /><a href="https://logis.loudoun.gov/metadata/Zoning.html"
    target="_blank">More Metadata</a><br /><br />The zoning layer constitutes the
    official zoning map for Loudoun County and is a component of the official zoning
    ordinance. It reflects expiration of grandfathering provisions of the 1972 Zoning
    Ordinance for certain proffered PD-H and R-Districts created prior to June 16, 1993.
    The zoning data is owned and maintained by Loudoun County, Virginia Department of
    Building and Development. Purpose: The purpose is to facilitate the administration
    of the zoning ordinance. The data are used extensively for taxation, subdivision
    review, permitting, and planning. Supplemental Information: Boundaries generally
    follow parcel lines, although there are several exceptions. The zoning data does
    not include zoning overlay districts, such as LDN, Floodplain, Quarry, or Mountainside
    Overlay Districts. Although the layer represents the official zoning map, a determination
    should be requested from the Zoning Administrator to verify zoning for a particular
    property. Data are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a feature class.
    The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum NAD83 HARN.
    It is also important to note that in order to determine the Zoning Ordinance Amendments
    (ZOAMs) that are applicable to a particular parcel governed under the Revised 1993
    Zoning Ordinance located within the Route 28 Tax District, the ZO_ZONE_DATE, Opt-In
    Letter, proffer statement, rezoning plat and/or concept development plan should
    be consulted as applicable. For an official determination regarding the applicable
    zoning, zoning ordinance text and/or whether proffered conditions may apply to a
    certain property, please contact the Zoning Administrator in the Department of Building
    and Development. Data are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a feature
    class. The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum NAD83
    HARN. Maintenance and Update Frequency: The zoning layer is updated on a daily basis
    as staff researches zoning for individual properties. Completeness Report: Features
    may have been eliminated or generalized due to scale and intended use. To assist
    Loudoun County, Virginia in the maintenance of the data, please provide any information
    concerning discovered errors, omissions, or other discrepancies found in the data.
    Ordinance: 1972, 1993 or Revised 1993; ordinance under which the property is administered;
    does not necessarily correspond to the zone (e.g. a property may have a zone code
    of PDH3 for the zone in accordance with the 1993 ordinance, but it should have a
    value of 1972 for ordinance if it is administered as another zone, such as PDH24,
    under the 1972 ordinance). The zone a property is administered as is not carried
    in the layer. Due to a court order, it is important to note that there are two developments
