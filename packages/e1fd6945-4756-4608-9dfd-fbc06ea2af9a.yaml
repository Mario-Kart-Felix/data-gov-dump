    of constant hydraulic conductivity values for the Elk City aquifer in western Oklahoma.
    The aquifer covers an area of approximately 193,000 acres and supplies ground water
    for irrigation, domestic, and industrial purposes in Beckham, Custer, Roger Mills,
    and Washita Counties along the divide between the Washita and Red River basins.
    The Elk City aquifer consists of the Elk City Sandstone and overlying terrace deposits,
    made up of clay, silt, sand and gravel, and dune sands in the eastern part and sand
    and gravel of the Ogallala Formation (or High Plains aquifer) in the western part
    of the aquifer. The Elk City aquifer is unconfined and composed of very friable
    sandstone, lightly cemented with clay, calcite, gypsum, or iron oxide. Most of the
    grains are fine-sized quartz but the grain size ranges from clay to cobble in the
    aquifer. The Doxey Shale underlies the Elk City aquifer and acts as a confining
    unit, restricting the downward movement of ground water. Values of hydraulic conductivity
    used as input to the ground-water flow model and in this data set are: 50 gallons
    per day per foot squared or 6.7 feet per day for the Elk City Sandstone; 500 gallons
    per day per foot squared or 66.8 feet per day for the Quaternary terrace deposits
    and dune sand; and 750 gallons per day per foot squared or 100.3 feet day for the
    Ogallala Formation. The hydraulic conductivity polygons from a ground-water modeling
    thesis were transferred to a photocopy of a paper map and digitized. The source
    map was published at a scale of 1:63,360. Ground-water flow models are numerical
    representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique;
    different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar results. Therefore,
    values of hydraulic conductivity used in the model and presented in this data set
    are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently
    collected data.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key": "bbox-east-long",ntt"value":

    digitized from a photocopy of a map published at a scale of 1:63,360, and represents
    the hydraulic conductivity polygons as reported by Lyons (1981). Hydraulic conductivity
    polygons represented at this scale are indicative of broad, regional trends and
    should not be interpreted as site-specific. The hydraulic conductivity polygons
    were drawn onto and digitized from a plate size, 29 inches by 39 inches, paper material,
    with a maximum registration root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.016 map inches (0.041
    map centimeters) and 82 feet (25 meters) ground distance. Ground-water flow models
    are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models
    are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar
    results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are closely interrelated. As long
    as these two model inputs are in balance the model has a small mean residual; it
    represents the natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is accurately
    known, the model can be used to accurately determine recharge. Likewise, if the
    hydraulic conductivity is poorly known, then the recharge will be poorly determined.
    Therefore, values of hydraulic conductivity used in the model and presented in this
    data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently
    collected data. In most aquifers, hydraulic conductivity measurements made in wells
    or in cores will range over several orders of magnitude, even over short horizontal
    and vertical distances. Hydraulic conductivity values derived from ground-water
    flow models represent areal generalizations and do not reflect the large local variance
    in well or core measurements.", "Access Constraints: None."]"nt},nt{ntt"key":
