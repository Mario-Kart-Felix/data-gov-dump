  the geologic and geomorphic map (see sheet 10, SIM 3281) of the Offshore of Santa
  Barbara map area, California. The vector data file is included in \"Geology_OffshoreSantaBarbara.zip,\"
  which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreSantaBarbara/data_catalog_OffshoreSantaBarbara.html.
  The offshore part of the map area largely consists of a relatively shallow (less
  than 75 m deep), gently offshore-dipping (less than 1 degree) shelf underlain by
  sediments derived primarily from relatively small coastal watersheds that drain
  the Santa Ynez Mountains. Shelf deposits are primarily sand (unit Qms) at water
  depths less than about 35 to 50 m and, at depths greater than about 35 to 50 m,
  are the more fine-grained sediments (very fine sand, silt, and clay) of unit Qmsf.
  The boundary between units Qms and Qmsf is based on observations and extrapolation
  from sediment sampling (see, for example, Reid and others, 2006) and camera ground-truth
  surveying (see sheet 6). It is important to note that the boundary between units
  Qms and Qmsf should be considered transitional and approximate and is expected to
  shift as a result of seasonal- to annual- to decadal-scale cycles in wave climate,
  sediment supply, and sediment transport. Coarser grained deposits (coarse sand to
  boulders) of unit Qmsc, which are recognized on the basis of their high backscatter
  and, in some cases, their moderate seafloor relief (sheets 1, 2, 3), are found most
  prominently in a large (about 0.75 km2) lobe that is present from about 1,800 to
  3,600 m offshore of the mouth of Arroyo Burro, in water depths of about 36 to 65
  m. The lobe is inferred to consist of coarse-grained sediment (coarse sand to boulders)
  that is resistant to erosion. Although these coarse-grained deposits almost certainly
  are derived from Arroyo Burro, the lobe could represent either the underflow deposits
  of late Holocene floods or a relict geomorphologic feature, having been deposited
  in shallower marine deltaic (or even alluvial?) environments at lower sea levels
  in the latest Pleistocene and early Holocene. Unit Qmsc also is present in shallower
  water (depths of about 10 to 20 m), most notably in a small area (approximately
  0.09 km2) that extends offshore from Montecito Creek, in the eastern part of the
  map area. The presence of coarser grained sediment (coarse sand and possibly gravel)
  also is inferred in shallower water (depths of 10 to 20 m) offshore from Arroyo
  Burro, but these deposits are mapped as unit Qmss because they are found within
  arcuate scour depressions that have been referred to as \"rippled scour depressions\"
  (see, for example, Cacchione and others, 1984; Phillips, 2007) or \"sorted bedforms\"
  (see, for example, Murray and Thieler, 2004; Goff and others, 2005; Trembanis and
  Hume, 2011). Although the general area in which Qmss scour depressions are found
  is not likely to change substantially, the boundaries of the unit(s), as well as
  the locations of individual depressions and their intervening flat sand sheets,
  likely are ephemeral, changing during significant storm events. Hydrocarbon-seep-induced
  topography, which is present most prominently along the axis of anticlines, includes
  many features (described by Keller and others, 2007) along the trend of the Mid-Channel
  Anticline, about 10 km south of the map area in the Santa Barbara Channel. Geologic
  map units associated with hydrocarbon emissions in the map area include grouped
  to solitary pockmarks (unit Qmp) and asphalt (tar) deposits (unit Qas), as well
  as areas of undifferentiated hydrocarbon-related features (unit Qhfu) that probably
  include a mix of mounds, mud volcanoes, pockmarks, carbonate mats, and other constructional
  and erosional \"seabed forms\" (see Keller and others, 2007), all of which are superimposed
  on consolidated, undivided Miocene and Pliocene bedrock (unit Tbu). Offshore bedrock
  exposures are assigned to the Miocene Monterey Formation (unit Tm) and to the undivided
  Miocene and Pliocene bedrock unit (Tbu), primarily on the basis of extrapolation
  from the onland geologic mapping of Minor and others (2009), as well as the geologic
  cross sections of Redin (2005). These cross sections, which are constrained by industry
  seismic-reflection data and petroleum well logs, suggest that a considerable part
  of the undivided bedrock unit may belong to the Pliocene and Pleistocene Pico Formation.
  Bedrock is, in some places, overlain by a thin (less than 1 m?) veneer of sediment,
  recognized on the basis of high backscatter, flat relief, continuity with moderate-
  to high-relief bedrock outcrops, and (in some cases) high-resolution seismic-reflection
  data; these areas, which are mapped as composite units Qms/Tbu or Qms/Tm, are interpreted
  as ephemeral sediment layers that may or may not be continuously present, depending
  on storms, seasonal and (or) annual patterns of sediment movement, or longer term
  climate cycles. The Santa Barbara Channel region, including the map area, has a
  long history of petroleum production (Barnum, 1998). The Monterey Formation is the
  primary petroleum-source rock in the Santa Barbara Channel, and the Pico Formation
  is one of the primary petroleum reservoirs. The bedrock units typically are exposed
  in structural highs that include uplifts associated with the partly blind(?), south-dipping
  Rincon Creek Fault Zone and the outer shelf anticlinal uplift that developed above
  the south strand of the Red Mountain Fault in the southwestern part of the map area.
  The Offshore of Santa Barbara map area is in the Ventura Basin, in the southern
  part of the Western Transverse Ranges geologic province, which is north of the California
  Continental Borderland (Fisher and others, 2009). This province has undergone significant
  north-south compression since the Miocene, and recent GPS data suggest north-south
  shortening of about 6 mm/yr (Larson and Webb, 1992). The active, east-west-striking
  Red Mountain and Rincon Creek Faults and their related folds are some of the structures
  on which this shortening occurs. This fault system, in aggregate, extends for about
  100 km through the Ventura and Santa Barbara Basins and represents an important
  earthquake hazard (see, for example, Fisher and others, 2009). Very high uplift
  rates of onland marine terraces from More Mesa (2.2 mm/yr), in the western part
  of the map area, to Summerland (0.7 mm/yr), a few kilometers east of the map area,
  are further indication of rapid shortening in this region (Keller and Gurrola, 2000).
