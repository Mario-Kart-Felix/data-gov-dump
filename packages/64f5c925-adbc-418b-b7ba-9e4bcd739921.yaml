    Integration Center (BTRIC), in the Energy and Transportation Science Division (ETSD)
    of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), focuses on research and development of
    new building technologies, whole-building and community integration, improved energy
    management in buildings and industrial facilities during their operational phase,
    and market transformations from old to new in all of these areas. A permanent staff
    of about 80, supplemented by student interns and post-graduates, is focused on building
    energy efficiency. The experimental facilities associated with BTRIC have been recognized
    and designated by DOE as a &amp;quot;National User Facility&amp;quot; for more than
    two decades. Often private sector laboratories are not available to conduct the
    tests and experiments possible using the BTRIC user facilities. In these cases,
    the facilities at ORNL can be accessed by the private sector, universities, and
    others by entering into a user agreement. Such agreements can be proprietary or
    non-proprietary, and are generally conducted on a full cost recovery basis. In most
    cases the user provides the test specimens (the materials or walls or roofs) and
    ORNL staff operates the apparatus, takes the data, and documents the results. Scheduling
    of user tests must not interfere with the core DOE-sponsored research ORNL is conducting
    using these same experimental facilities. Almost all of the buildings-related research
    conducted by ORNL is done in collaboration with industry partners through cooperative
    research and development agreements (CRADAs) or Work for Others (WFO) arrangements.
    Access to user facilities is a two-fold process. Prospective users submit research
    proposals directly to the facility of interest. Acceptance of proposals depends
    on scientific merit, suitability of the facility for the project, selection of a
    collaborator, and appropriateness of the work to DOE objectives. Concurrently, a
    contractual agreement is executed between ORNL and the user institution. This User
    Facility Agreement, which can be either proprietary or nonproprietary, stipulates
    the terms and conditions (including disposition of intellectual property) for the
    project. Some facilities are available for nonproprietary research at no cost, while
    some facilities must recoup the actual costs incurred for staff and equipment time.
    More information can be found on ORNL&amp;#39;s Partnerships Directorate website.
