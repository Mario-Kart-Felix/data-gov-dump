  in Arkansas The Jails and Prisons sub-layer is part of the Emergency Law Enforcement
  Sector and the Critical Infrastructure Category. A Jail or Prison consists of any
  facility or location where individuals are regularly and lawfully detained against
  their will. This includes Federal and State prisons, local jails, and juvenile detention
  facilities, as well as law enforcement temporary holding facilities. Work camps,
  including camps operated seasonally, are included if they otherwise meet the definition.
  A Federal Prison is a facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons for the
  incarceration of individuals. A State Prison is a facility operated by a state,
  commonwealth, or territory of the US for the incarceration of individuals for a
  term usually longer than 1 year. A Juvenile Detention Facility is a facility for
  the incarceration of those who have not yet reached the age of majority (usually
  18 years). A Local Jail is a locally administered facility that holds inmates beyond
  arraignment (usually 72 hours) and is staffed by municipal or county employees.
  A temporary holding facility, sometimes referred to as a \"police lock up\" or \"drunk
  tank\", is a facility used to detain people prior to arraignment. Locations that
  are administrative offices only are excluded from the dataset. This definition of
  Jails is consistent with that used by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in their \"National
  Jail Census\", with the exception of \"temporary holding facilities\", which the
  DOJ excludes. If the facility is enclosed with a fence, wall, or structure with
  a gate around the buildings only, the locations were depicted as ONENTITY at the
  entrance. If the facility's buildings are not enclosed, the locations were depicted
  as ONENTITY on the building or BLOCKFACE on the correct street segment. Personal
  homes, administrative offices and temporary locations are intended to be excluded
  from this dataset, but a few may be included. Personal homes of constables may exist
  due to the fact that many constables work out of their home. With the merge of the
  Law Enforcement and the Correctional Institutions datasets, the NAICS Descriptions
  were assigned based on the facility's main function, which were determined by the
  entity's name, facility type, web research and state supplied data. For records
  where the entity's name represents both datasets, the NAICS Description was assigned
  based on the specifications of the dataset the record is assigned to. Text fields
  in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database
  engine search results. All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde)
  have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate
  use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this
  dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. Based upon this attribute, the
  oldest record dates from 2006/06/28 and the newest record dates from 2008/02/19\",\n\t\"license_title\":
