    Impacts has resulted in the capture of broad band high frequency energy resulting
    from the impact of projectiles onto targets.  These test impacts have been demonstrated
    from 3 to 7 kilometers per second at both NASA WSTF and Sandia National Labs.  In
    all cases, radio frequency (RF) energy was captured as radiated from the impact
    and conducted from the impact by the target material.  If these broad band impulses
    of energy can be received and analyzed, it will be possible to locate the point
    of impact.rnThe problem lies in the processing of a "messy" broad band signal.
     The innovation herein is that these signals may be "cleaned up" and become useful
    by means of passive RFID Surface Acoustic Wave circuits.rnA SAW device, commonly
    used for inexpensive inventory coding and security entry systems can be excited
    by the energy from an HVI.  The result would be transmission of a unique code, distinguishable
    from RF noise and other encoded SAW responses by a receiver/decoder.  SAW devices
    are inexpensive, require no power, and are physically small and robust.  They can
    be manufactured in quantity at low cost (as demonstrated by the commercial use of
    the devices as throw-away inventory markers).  SAW devices placed over the surface
    of vehicles or structures exposed to HVI impacts could detect the HVI RF impulses
    and respond with a unique code that would identify the location of the impact.rnThus,
    an impact detection and location system could be implemented where the RF impulse
    energy from a HVI is used to encode and transmit a signal to a passive receiver
    that would provide useful information on the location and magnitude of the HVI.rnTo
    best execute this program, Invocon is joined by another small business ? ASRD.  This
    company is a major player in RFID SAW device design and fabrication planning.  Both
    companies have a successful history of product development for both NASA and commercial
    customersrn",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
