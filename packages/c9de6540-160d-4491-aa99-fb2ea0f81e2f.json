	"notes": "&lt;p&gt;Water comprises the majority of the daily mass requirements for crewed space missions. Used&amp;nbsp;for drinking, food prep, or hygiene, water is one of the most critical life support elements.&amp;nbsp;Reliable water recovery is paramount for long term space exploration either on the&amp;nbsp;International Space Station (ISS) or&amp;nbsp;beyond Earth&amp;rsquo;s gravity well. Advances in water recovery have allowed longer mission durations&amp;nbsp;and decreased launch costs. In order to visit or even habituate extraterrestrial bodies (Mars,&amp;nbsp;Europa) further advances in water recovery are needed.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current environmental control and life support systems on the ISS are focused on air and water recovery. Wastewater is pretreated with chromic acid and then distilled. The pretreatment turns about 10&#37; to 30&#37; of the wastewater into unusable brine and makes further water recovery difficult.&amp;nbsp;In addition, no chemicals are retrieved for reuse from the brine. If the wastewater were treated in bioreactors and then distilled or filtered, chemical pretreatment would not be needed and the remaining brine could serve as a resource for chemical and further water recovery.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Development and application of brine tolerant ion-exchange resins could provide more efficient methods for retrieving elements and pure water from salt water, and provide feed stocks for commercial processes that generate bleach, HCl, and Na\/KOH (e.g., Chlor-alkalai Process).&amp;nbsp;If proven feasible, the combined benefits would reduce consumables and further close the water loop for future space exploration. and generate consumable chemicals, such as HCl, NaOH , KOH and sodium hypochlorite (bleach).&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
