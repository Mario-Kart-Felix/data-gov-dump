    Program (CRCP) long-term goals for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, towed-diver surveys (aka. towboard surveys) were conducted by the
    Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science
    Center (PIFSC) as part of the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP)
    Cruises. 11 towboard surveys (25.85 km in length), were conducted at Pagan during
    the Mariana Archipelago RAMP Cruise HA1401 from 20140325 to 20140518. Towboard surveys
    are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing
    the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances
    (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates
    (e.g., Crown of Thorns sea stars, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these
    populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are
    towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately
    15 m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into
    ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon,
    all large-bodied reef fishes (greater than 50 cm total length) seen within 5 m either
    side and 10 m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to
    the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital
    video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover
    of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses
    a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea
    urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera
    which images the benthos at 15-second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent
    cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped
    with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5-second intervals.
    Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 5-second intervals using
    a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm
    is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the
    reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on
    the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the
    depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. This metadata applies
    to the benthic characterization observations.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
