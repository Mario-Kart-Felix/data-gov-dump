    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;NASA is responsible for a number
    of facilities/structures with metallic structural and non-structural components
    in a highly corrosive environment.&amp;nbsp; Metals require periodic maintenance
    activity to guard against the insidious effects of corrosion and thus ensure that
    structures meet or exceed design or performance life. &amp;nbsp;The standard practice
    for protecting metallic substrates in atmospheric environments is the application
    of corrosion protective coating system. &amp;nbsp;These coating systems work via
    a variety of methods (barrier, galvanic and/or inhibitor) and adhere to the substrate
    through a combination of chemical and physical bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintenance
    at KSC is governed by NASA-STD-5008B (&lt;em&gt;Protective Coating of Carbon Steel,
    Stainless Steel, and Aluminum on Launch Structures, Facilities, and Ground Support
    Equipment&lt;/em&gt;),&amp;nbsp;which establishes practices for the protective coating
    of launch facilities used by or for NASA programs and projects.&amp;nbsp; The Standard
    is also recommended guidance for all NASA Centers and is for the design of non-flight
    hardware used to support the operations of receiving, transportation, handling,
    assembly, inspection, test, checkout, service, and launch of space vehicles and
    payloads at NASA launch, landing, or retrieval sites. The criteria and practices
    contained within the Standard may be applied to items used at the manufacturing,
    development, and test sites upstream of the launch, landing, or retrieval sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NASA-STD-5008B
    includes an &amp;ldquo;Approved Products List&amp;rdquo; (APL) of coatings that
    have previously been tested and qualified for use.&amp;nbsp; The APL, however, includes
    coatings that have very high volatile organic compound VOC levels which are no longer
    compliant with current environmental regulations.&amp;nbsp; Some contain other hazardous
    constituents that are also subject to regulation.&amp;nbsp; The limited number of
    approved coatings in NASA-STD-5008B presents an obsolescence&amp;nbsp;risk to NASA
    if&amp;nbsp;materials should become unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project
    will identify and&amp;nbsp;qualify environmentally preferable coating alternatives
    to determine whether they provide adequate corrosion protection along with other
    properties&amp;nbsp;such as material compatibility and adhesion for use on NASA
    ground-based space infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study will continue through
    FY 2016 and will include testing for adhesion, compatibility, removability/reparability,
    and flexibility. Test team members continue to identify other coatings to include
    in the next round of testing.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
