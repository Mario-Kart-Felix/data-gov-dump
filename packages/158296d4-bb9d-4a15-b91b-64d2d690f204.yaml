    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Batteries represent complex systems whose
    internal state vari- ables are either inaccessible to sensors or hard to measure
    un- der operational conditions. This work exemplifies how more detailed model information
    and more sophisticated prediction techniques can improve both the accuracy as well
    as the re- sidual uncertainty of the prediction in Prognostics and Health Management.
    The more dramatic performance improvement between various prediction techniques
    is in their ability to learn complex non-linear degradation behavior from the train-
    ing data and discard any external noise disturbances.rnAn algorithm that manages
    these sources of uncertainty well can yield higher confidence in predictions, expressed
    by narrower uncertainty bounds. We observed that the particle filter approach results
    in RUL distributions which have better precision (narrower pdfs) by several u03c3s
    (if approximated as Gaussian) as compared to the other regression methods. How-
    ever, PF requires a more complex implementation and compu- tational overhead than
    the other methods. This illustrates the basic tradeoff between modeling and algorithm
    development versus prediction accuracy and precision. For situations like battery
    health management where the rate of capacity degrada- tion is rather slow, one can
    rely on simple regression methods that tend to perform well as more data are accumulated
    and still predict far enough in advance to avoid any catastrophic failures. Techniques
    like GPR or even the baseline approach can offer a suitable platform in these situations
    by managing the uncertainty fairly well with much simpler implementations. Other
    data sets may allow much smaller prediction horizons and hence require precise techniques
    like particle filters.rnIn this study, we conclude that there are several methods
    one could employ for battery health management applica- tions. Based on end user
    requirements and available resources, a choice can be made between simple or more
    elegant tech- niques. The particle filter based approach emerges as the winner when
    accuracy and precision are considered more important than other requirements.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
