    Mapping Initiative was a two-phase mapping endeavor that occurred over a three-year
    period (2007-2009). Note that while the processing occurred during the 2207-2009
    period, all satellite data used in the project was acquired in 2005. Concurrent
    with mapping the state of Kansas, the Kansas River Watershed was also mapped. The
    Kansas River Watershed extends into southern Nebraska and includes a portion of
    eastern Colorado. During Phase I a Modified Level I map was produced. In Phase II
    a series of maps, Modified Level II through IV, were produced. All KLCP 2005 map
    products were produced at four spatial extents: the state of Kansas plus a 300 meter
    buffer, a DEM-derived watershed boundary of the Kansas River, the Kansas River watershed
    boundary plus a 1,000 meter buffer, and a combined dataset of the state of Kansas
    plus 300 meter buffer and the watershed plus 1,000 meter buffer.These extents are
    annotated in the file names with the extentions k, w, wb, and kwb respectively.
    The goal of Phase II was to map subclasses for grassland and cropland, classes which
    were mapped during Phase I. For the Level II map, cool- and warm-season grasslands
    were mapped along with Spring Crop, Summer Crop, Alfalfa, Fallow, and Double-Crop
    classes. For the Level III map, the Summer Crop subclasses Corn, Soybean, and Sorghum
    were mapped, and the Spring Crop class was reassigned to Winter Wheat. In the Level
    IV map, irrigation status was mapped and added to the Level III crop type map.The
    Kansas Land Cover Patterns Level IV map contains twenty-four land use/land cover
    classes and has a positional accuracy and spatial resolution appropriate for producing
    1:50,000 scale maps. The minimum map unit (MMU) varies by land cover class and ranges
    from 0.22 to 5.12 acres. In general, the mapping methodology used a hybrid, hierarchical
    classification of multi-temporal, multi-resolution imagery to develop modified Anderson
    Level II through Anderson Level IV land cover maps of the Kansas River Watershed
    and the State of Kansas. More specifically, multi-seasonal Landsat Thematic Mapper
    (TM) imagery from the 2004 and 2005 growing season was used to map the grassland
    subclasses (cool- and warm-season grasslands). while MODIS NDVI time-series imagery
    from the 2005 growing season was used to map cropland subclasses. The land use/land
    cover classes in the Level IV map are coded hierarchically to allow aggregation
    of land use and land cover classes as needed by the end-user. For example, a user
    can aggregate the Level IV map classes to a Level III classification by ignoring
    or eliminating the last digit of each land use/land cover class. Likewise, a Level
    II and Level I map can be created from the Level IV map by eliminating the last
    two and three digits, respectively, from each Level IV land use/land cover class.
    A formal accuracy assessment found the Level II, Level III, and Level IV maps to
    have overall accuracy levels of 86.3%, 82.0%, and 74.3%, respectively. User and
    Producer (per-class errors of commission and omission) accuracies vary by land cover
    class and users are encouraged to reference the reported accuracy levels in the
    final report and/or metadata when using the Kansas Land Cover Patterns map series.
    Digital versions of the map, metadata, and accuracy assessment can be accessed from
    the Data Access Support Center (http://www.kansasgis.org/) or the Kansas Applied
    Remote Sensing Program (http://www.kars.ku.edu/).",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
