    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "We propose building upon the modular extensible
    architecture and existing capabilities of Open|SpeedShop to provide seamless, integrated,
    heterogeneous processor performance analysis. The NVIDIA GPU and Intel Many Integrated
    Core (MIC) processors are increasingly important at high performance computing (HPC)
    laboratories within NASA for use on NASA's high-end computing (HEC) projects because
    of their ability to accelerate scientific application performance.  In order to
    understand what impact these accelerators are having on performance, tools must
    succinctly present heterogeneous processor performance information.rnrnOne of the
    key goals of this work is to develop innovative methods for presenting the performance
    information extracted from applications running on both traditional CPU and GPU/MIC
    processors. And, specifically, to provide command line interface (CLI) and graphical
    user interface (GUI) displays of the heterogeneous processor performance information
    that facilitates the user's understanding of how their application utilizes the
    accelerator.rnrnFor this project, Phase I GPU-related research will include measuring
    the usefulness of a GPU kernel, including device utilization, data transfer rates,
    device efficiency metric, internal device tiling factors, device memory hierarchy
    usage, as well as additional factors outlined in the referenced material. When measuring
    the performance of an application that contains concurrent processing on both the
    CPU and GPU processors, attributing time spent to the proper processor can be difficult
    - a difficulty exacerbated by the potential presence and usage of multiple accelerators
    concurrently. Accurately measuring the interactions of multiple accelerator devices
    is necessary in order to accurately report the application's performance to the
    user, but is difficult with the current set of accelerator interfaces. Developing
    techniques for mitigating these limitations will be another area of our GPU research.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
