    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "This data set contains measurements of Global
    Positioning System (GPS) signals reflected from the Earthu0092s surface and collected
    on an airborne platform. The measurements were taken over the Soil Moisture Experiments
    2002 (SMEX02) Walnut Creek Watershed area in Iowa, USA. The reflections collected
    were from flat agricultural land with mostly corn and soybean crops in mid-development.
    Data were collected on 19, 25, 27 June 2002 and 1, 2, 5-8 July 2002. nnThe data
    are categorized by campaigns and dates, and are processed into levels. Level u00930u0094
    files are text files directly from the receiver. Levels above u00930u0094 are output
    in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) format, ordered in UTC time and gzipped. The HDF
    files contain metadata in the form of attributes that describe the data seta and
    variables. The variables also contain attributes to self-describe the individual
    data pieces.nnA modified GPS Delay Mapping Receiver (DMR) tracks and measures the
    direct, line-of-sight, right hand circularly polarized (RHCP) signal of a GPS satellite.
    It also simultaneously measures the delayed, Earth- reflected, near-specular, left
    hand circularly polarized (LHCP) GPS signal. The DMR was mounted on the NCAR C-130
    along with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Passive and Active L- and S-band
    (PALS) microwave instrument. GPS signal reflections were collected using the standard
    hemispherical RHCP antenna mounted on the roof of the aircraft, and a reversed polarization
    LHCP hemispherical antenna mounted on the belly. The receiver position is computed
    from either an external navigation source or the receiver's own GPS navigation solution,
    whichever is more accurate. The GPS surface reflections are georeferenced to a composite
    Earth consisting of the WGS-84 ellipsoid, the EGM96 geoid, and the GTOPO30 elevation
    model.nnThe primary objective was to collect land reflections for sensitivity of
    the reflected GPS power to temporal and spatial soil moisture and foliage attenuation.
    The measurements are a form of bistatic radar and can be used to estimate the surface
    scattering coefficient  (roughness and/or dielectric properties) and path delays
    between the direct and reflected GPS signals. Scattering coefficients can be used
    to estimate changes in surface soil moisture. nnThese data were collected as part
    of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing
    System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite
    on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate
    the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include
    assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture
    estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature,
    topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions
    that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
