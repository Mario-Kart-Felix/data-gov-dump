  unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
  thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
  years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
  we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
  to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
  in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
  to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
  air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
  Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
  spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
  explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
  and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
  rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
  expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
  NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
  to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
  around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
  continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
  Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
  Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
  such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"title\": \"National

  enormous given the fact thatrnin the US alone there are nearly 6 million flights
  per year of commercial aircraft.rnThis situation has driven numerous policy and
  procedural measures to help developrnenvironmentally friendly technologies which
  are safe and affordable and reduce thernenvironmental impact of aviation. However,
  many of these technologies require significantrninitial investment in newer aircraft
  fleets and modifications to existing regulationsrnwhich are both long and costly
  enterprises. We propose to use an anomalyrndetection method based on Virtual Sensors
  to help detect overconsumption of fuel inrnaircraft which relies only on the data
  recorded during flight of most existing commercialrnaircraft, thus significantly
  reducing the cost and complexity of implementing thisrnmethod. The Virtual Sensors
  developed here are ensemble-learning regression modelsrnfor detecting the overconsumption
  of fuel based on instantaneous measurementsrnof the aircraft state. This approach
  requires no additional information about standardrnoperating procedures or other
  encoded domain knowledge. We present experimentalrnresults on three data sets and
  compare five different Virtual Sensors algorithms. Thernfirst two data sets are
  publicly available and consist of a simulated data set from arnflight simulator
  and a real-world turbine disk.We show the ability to detect anomaliesrnwith high
  accuracy on these data sets. These sets contain seeded faults, meaning thatrnthey
  have been deliberately injected into the system. The second data set is from realworldrnfleet
  of 84 jet aircraft where we show the ability to detect fuel overconsumptionrnwhich
  can have a significant environmental and economic impact. To the best of ourrnknowledge,
  this is the first study of its kind in the aviation domain.\",\n\t\"owner_org\":
