    ARE CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD. Glenn Research Center management is reviewing
    the availability requirements for these software packages. We are working with Center
    management to get the review completed and issues resolved in a timely manner. We
    will post updates on this website when the issues are resolved. We apologize for
    any inconvenience. Please contact Jonathan Litt, jonathan.s.litt@nasa.gov, if you
    have any questions in the meantime.rnrn**Subject Area:**rn    Engine Healthrnrn**Description:**rn
       This data set was generated with the C-MAPSS simulator. C-MAPSS stands for 'Commercial
    Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation' and it is a tool for the simulation of
    realistic large commercial turbofan engine data. Each flight is a combination of
    a series of flight conditions with a reasonable linear transition period to allow
    the engine to change from one flight condition to the next. The flight conditions
    are arranged to cover a typical ascent from sea level to 35K ft and descent back
    down to sea level. The fault was injected at a given time in one of the flights
    and persists throughout the remaining flights, effectively increasing the age of
    the engine. The intent is to identify which flight and when in the flight the fault
    occurred.rnrn**How Data Was Acquired:**rn    The data provided is from a high fidelity
    system level engine simulation designed to simulate nominal and fault engine degradation
    over a series of flights. The simulated data was created with a Matlab Simulink
    tool called C-MAPSS.rnrn**Sample Rates and Parameter Description:**rn    The flights
    are full flight recordings sampled at 1 Hz and consist of 30 engine and flight condition
    parameters. Each flight contains 7 unique flight conditions for an approximately
    90 min flight including ascent to cruise at 35K ft and descent back to sea level.
    The parameters for each flight are the flight conditions, health indicators, measurement
    temperatures and pressure measurements.rnrn**Faults/Anomalies:**rn    Faults arose
    from the inlet engine fan, the low pressure compressor, the high pressure compressor,
    the high pressure turbine and the low pressure turbine.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
