    August 17, 1996, the Japanese Space Agency (NASDA - National Space Development Agency)
    launched the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS). ADEOS was in a descending,
    Sun synchronous orbit with a nominal equatorial crossing time of 10:30 a.m. Among
    the instruments carried aboard the ADEOS spacecraft was the Ocean Color and Temperature
    Scanner (OCTS). OCTS is an optical radiometer with 12 bands covering the visible,
    near infrared and thermal infrared regions. (Eight of the bands are in the VIS/NIR.
    These are the only bands calibrated and processed by the OBPG) OCTS has a swath
    width of approximately 1400 km, and a nominal nadir resolution of 700 m. The instrument
    operated at three tilt states (20 degrees aft, nadir and 20 degrees fore), similar
    to SeaWiFS.      n                                                                                nIn
    2001, The Sensor Intercomparison and Merger for Biological and Interdisciplinary
    Oceanic Studies (SIMBIOS) Program embarked on a collaborative effort with the National
    Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan and the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view
    Sensor (SeaWiFS) Project to reprocess the entire Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner
    (OCTS) global area coverage (GAC) data set and make those products available to
    the scientific community. As part of the collaboration, NASDA provided the complete
    OCTS GAC Level-1A data set (November 1996 through June 1997) to NASA along with
    their unique expertise and analysis of the data products. (The OCTS GAC data set
    was created from the LAC resolution data by subsampling every 5th line and 4th pixel).
    NASA provided the processing expertise, methodologies and resources, and the archive
    and distribution support.                     n                                                                                nThe
    focus of the OCTS GAC reprocessing work was to minimize the potential processing-related
    differences (atmospheric correction and bio-optical algorithms) between the SeaWiFS
    and OCTS missions, by reprocessing the entire OCTS GAC mission archive using the
    same software and algorithms employed for standard SeaWiFS processing. n        This
    product contain annual Level-3 binned (Equal-Area Sinusoidal grid) data products
    in three variants:n            CHL- which includes chlorophyll a,n            KD490
    - which includes diffuse attenuation at 490nm andn            RRS which includes
    the remote sensing reflectance in the visible bands, aerosol optical depth at 862nm
    and aerosol angstrom parameter.n    ",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
