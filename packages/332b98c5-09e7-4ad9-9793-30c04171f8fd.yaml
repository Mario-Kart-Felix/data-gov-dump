  (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from
  the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
  Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless
  national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File
  is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to
  cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block
  delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract
  that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same
  decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,..,
  3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract.
  Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum
  size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census
  Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated
  BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census
  Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous
  area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered
  within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never
  cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic
  entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional
  districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have
  a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water
  area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and
  Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary
  into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau
  delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The
  Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore,
  water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.<br /><br
  /> This table contains housing data, including building age, value and/or rent,
  length of occupation, number of units, home heating type, and number of vehicles
  from the American Community Survey 2006-2010 database for block groups. The American
  Community Survey (ACS) is a household survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau
  that currently has an annual sample size of about 3.5 million addresses. ACS estimates
  provides communities with the current information they need to plan investments
  and services. Information from the survey generates estimates that help determine
  how more than $400 billion in federal and state funds are distributed annually.
  Each year the survey produces data that cover the periods of 1-year, 3-year, and
  5-year estimates for geographic areas in the United States and Puerto Rico, ranging
  from neighborhoods to Congressional districts to the entire nation. This table also
  has a companion table (Same table name with MOE Suffix) with the margin of error
  (MOE) values for each estimated element. MOE is expressed as a measure value for
  each estimated element. So a value of 25 and an MOE of 5 means 25 +/- 5 (or statistical
  certainty between 20 and 30). There are also special cases of MOE. An MOE of -1
  means the associated estimates do not have a measured error. An MOE of 0 means that
  error calculation is not appropriate for the associated value. An MOE of 109 is
  set whenever an estimate value is 0. The MOEs of aggregated elements and percentages
  must be calculated. This process means using standard error calculations as described
  in \"American Community Survey Multiyear Accuracy of the Data (3-year 2008-2010
  and 5-year 2006-2010)\". Also, following Census guidelines, aggregated MOEs do not
  use more than 1 0-element MOE (109) to prevent over estimation of the error. Due
  to the complexity of the calculations, some percentage MOEs cannot be calculated
  (these are set to null in the summary-level MOE tables).\",\n\t\"license_title\":
