  by oysters, Crassostrea virginica, in North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina, USA were
  studied using a replicated BACI (Before - After Control - Incident) design in which
  all creeks are sampled simultaneously. The study known as the CREEK Project began
  in January 1996. Based on detailed geomorphological observations from North Inlet
  creeks, by fall of 1996, eight small intertidal creeks had been selected based on
  similarities in size and configuration. During fall of 1996, the naturally occurring
  oyster biomass was estimated by measuring reef area in each creek and quantifying
  oyster biomass in square meter quadrats randomly collected from field surveys within
  each creek. This initial survey revealed an average biomass of about 8 grams dry
  body weight of oysters per cubic meter of water volume at bank full levels based
  on all eight creeks. In January 1997, oysters were added or removed from each creek
  to equalize oyster biomass at 8 grams dry body weight per cubic meter of bank-full
  water volume in each creek. This stage of the project is referred to as the \"pre-manipulation\"
  period where all creeks have the same amount of oyster biomass. About one year later
  in February 1998, living oysters were removed from four of the eight creeks (creeks
  1, 4, 5, and 8), resulting in zero dry body weight per cubic meter of water at bank
  full volume. This stage of the project is considered the \"manipulation\" period
  where four of the creeks have had all of the oyster biomass removed. The same month
  (February 1998) that the four creeks had their living oysters removed (manipulated
  creeks), oyster reef area and biomass for the unmanipulated creeks were estimated
  using quadrat sampling. The period after this is considered the \"post-manipulation\"
  stage. About two years later during the post-manipulation period, a final biomass
  estimate was performed in May 2000 to determine if oyster recruitment and trampling
  during sampling activities had altered oyster biomass during the manipulation phase
  of the study. The database file 'Final CREEK Oyster Biomass Estimates' contains
  data from the initial naturally occurring biomass survey in Fall 1996, the biomass
  of oysters in each creek in January and May 1997 following adjustments to equalize
  biomass to 8 g dry body weight per cubic meter, the biomass survey in February 1998
  of unmanipulated creeks following removal of oysters from manipulated creeks, and
  data from the final biomass survey in May 2000. The final estimate data are in tabular
  form and are based on detailed field surveys of creek geomorphology (see CREEK Geomorphology
  database).\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\": \"temporal-extent-begin\",\n\t\t\"value\":
