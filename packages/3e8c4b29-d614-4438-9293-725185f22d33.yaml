    with 3x3 meter cell size representing the rugosity of several deep coral priority
    areas off the Atlantic Coast of Florida, derived from data collected in October
    2010. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel
    Ron Brown, as well as federal, university, and private sector partners, acquired
    multibeam bathymetry data off the Atlantic Coast of Florida from 10/26/2010 to 10/27/2010.
    Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg EM 710 multibeam echosounder (70
    kHz). It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Attitude
    and sound velocity correctors applied to the data. Verified tides were not applied
    to the data, leaving the depth values referenced to the ellipsoid. The imagery is
    projected in the UTM Zone 17 north, NAD83 datum. The processed CARIS data was used
    to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. The CARIS Export option "BASE
    Surface to Image" was then used to create a GeoTiff of the priority areas. Rugosity
    was derived from this surface using NOAA's Benthic Terrain Modeler extension.",nt"license_title":
