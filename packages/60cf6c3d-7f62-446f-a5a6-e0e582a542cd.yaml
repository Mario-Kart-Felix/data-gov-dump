    on developing affordable Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) technologies
    in aerospace, automotive and other areas. The fundamental objective is to enhance
    availability, increase safety and reduce unscheduled maintenance costs. IVHM enables
    fault detection, isolation, root cause analysis and potential diagnostics. In addition,
    it aims at developing robust algorithms to predict the onset of a fault, minimizing
    false alarms and estimating the remaining useful life of the mission despite the
    adversity. IVHM optimally integrates technologies in sensors, vehicle systems, prognostics
    and diagnostics.rnrnNASA and CSIR-NAL have received an award to jointly organize
    the first Indo-US Workshop on IVHM and Aviation Safety (WIAS), sponsored by Indo-US
    Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) from Jan. 5th to 7th, 2012 in Bangalore, which
    is the aerospace hub of the country. rnrn# PurposernThe purpose of the workshop
    is to deliberate, discuss and evolve the state of the art aerospace systemsu2019
    health management strategies, and identify opportunities for collaboration between
    US & Indian Institutions. This will help orchestrate preparation of IVHM roadmap
    into the future. This is an attempt, initiated at NAL, in the direction of creating
    an ecosystem among R&D, Academics and Industry on the subject matter as a part of
    the IVHM Mission for aerospace industry. We thus see unprecedented opportunities
    for discussions and knowledge networking in the areas of IVHM.rnrn# ParticipationrnAn
    active participation from following organizations / agencies is expected:rnrnLeading
    US academic institutions including Stanford, Berkley, Georgia Tech and Auburn UniversityrnUS
    Industry including GM, GE, Honeywell, Boeing Research, Lockheed Martin, Rockwell
    CollinsrnrnEuropean organizations such as the Center of Excellence, Cranfield, UK;
    LMS International, Belgium; Airbus & Dassault systems, FrancernTop Indian Academia
    like IITs & IISc, R&D (like DRDO, CSIR, DST, DOS), Industry, Regulatory (DGCA) and
    Armed Forces.rnrnThe IVHM program envisages close cooperation of R&D, Academia and
    Industry (national and international) and has immediate applications to legacy,
    current and future generation aircraft and other programs.rnrn# Expected outcome

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
