    for coarse roots measured on the forest floor and measurements of fine root growth
    down to 2-m depth at the km 67 Rainfall Exclusion Experiment site, Tapajos National
    Forest, Brazil. The study site was part of a rainfall exclusion experiment that
    was conducted from 1999-2006 to develop an understanding of the physical processes
    driving the observed soil water dynamics at the site. All surface roots intersected
    along three 1000-m long x 1-m wide transects were identified to species, measured,
    and biomass calculated. The collections were made on January 26, 2001 during the
    experimental rain exclusion period.The fine root growth was measured from 0.5-m
    to 2-m depth with a rhizotron. The rhizotron tubes were inserted into deep soil
    pits in the control and treatment plots. Average root growth measurements are provided
    by depth interval on a monthly basis from July 25, 2000 to December 14, 2003. DATA
    QUALITY STATEMENT: The Data Center has determined that there are questions about
    the quality of the data reported in this data set. The data set has missing or incomplete
    data, metadata, or other documentation that diminishes the usability of the products.
    KNOWN PROBLEMS: There are discrepancies with the documentation, collection dates
    reported and collection method for fine roots utilizing rhizotrons. ",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
