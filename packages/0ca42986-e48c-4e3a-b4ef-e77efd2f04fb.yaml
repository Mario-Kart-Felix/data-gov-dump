    geologic and geomorphic map of the Drakes Bay and Vicinity map area, California.
    The polygon shapefile is included in "Geology_DrakesBay.zip," which is accessible
    from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/DrakesBay/data_catalog_DrakesBay.html. Marine geology
    and geomorphology was mapped in the Drakes Bay and Vicinity map area from approximate
    Mean High Water (MHW) to the 3-nautical-mile limit of Californiau2019s State Waters.
    MHW is defined at an elevation of 1.46 m above the North American Vertical Datum
    of 1988 (NAVD 88) (Weber and others, 2005). Offshore geologic units were delineated
    on the basis of integrated analyses of adjacent onshore geology with multibeam bathymetry
    and backscatter imagery, seafloor-sediment and rock samples (Reid and others, 2006),
    digital camera and video imagery, and high-resolution seismic-reflection profiles.
    The onshore bedrock mapping was compiled from Galloway (1977), Clark and Brabb (1997),
    and Wagner and Gutierrez (2010). Quaternary mapping was compiled from Witter and
    others (2006) and Wagner and Gutierrez (2010), with unit contacts modified based
    on analysis of 2012 LiDAR imagery; and additional Quaternary mapping by M.W. Manson.
    San Andreas Fault traces are compiled from California Geological Survey (1974) and
    Wagner and Gutierrez (2010). The offshore part of the map area includes the large
    embayment known as Drakes Bay and extends from the shoreline to water depths of
    about 40 to 60 m. The continental shelf is quite wide in this area, with the shelfbreak
    located west of the Farallon High, about 35 km offshore. This map area is largely
    characterized by a relatively flat (<0.8u00b0) bedrock platform that is locally
    overlain by thin sediment cover. Sea level has risen about 125 to 130 m over about
    the last 21,000 years (for example, Lambeck and Chappell, 2001; Peltier and Fairbanks,
    2006), leading to broadening of the continental shelf, progressive eastward migration
    of the shoreline and wave-cut platform, and associated transgressive erosion and
    deposition (for example, Catuneanu, 2006). Land-derived sediment was carried into
    this dynamic setting, and then subjected to full Pacific Ocean wave energy and strong
    currents before deposition or offshore transport. Tectonic influences impacting
    shelf morphology and geology are related to local faulting, folding, uplift, and
    subsidence. The Point Reyes Fault Zone runs through the map area and is an offshore
    curvilinear reverse fault zone (Hoskins and Griffiths, 1971; McCulloch, 1987; Heck
    and others, 1990; Stozek, 2012) that likely connects with the western San Gregorio
    fault further to the south (Ryan and others, 2008), making it part of the San Andreas
    Fault System. The Point Reyes Fault Zone is characterized by a 5 to 11 km-wide zone
    that is associated with two main fault structures, the Point Reyes Fault and the
    Western Point Reyes Fault. Late Pleistocene uplift of marine terraces on the Point
    Reyes Peninsula suggests active deformation west of the San Andreas Fault (Grove
    and others, 2010). Offshore Double Point, the Point Reyes Fault is associated with
    warping and folding of Neogene strata visible on high-resolution seismic data. In
    this map area the cumulative (post-Miocene) slip-rate on the Point Reyes Fault Zone
    is poorly constrained, but is estimated to be 0.3 mm/yr based on vertical offset
    of granitic basement rocks (McCulloch, 1987; Wills and others, 2008). Salinian granitic
    basement rocks (unit Kgg) are exposed on the Point Reyes headland and offshore in
    the northwest corner of the map area. The granitic rocks are mapped on the basis
    of massive, bulbous texture and extensive fracturing in multibeam imagery, and high
    backscatter. Much of the inner shelf is underlain by Neogene marine sedimentary
    rocks that form the core of the Point Reyes syncline (Weaver, 1949), and include
    the mid- to late Miocene Monterey Formation (unit Tm), late Miocene Santa Margarita
    Formation (unit Tsm), late Miocene Santa Cruz Mudstone (unit Tsc), and late Miocene
    to early Pliocene Purisima Formation (unit Tp; Clark and Brabb, 1997; Powell and
    others, 2007). At Millers Point, the Monterey Formation is exposed onshore and on
    the seafloor in the nearshore and appears highly fractured with bedding planes difficult
    to identify. Seafloor exposures of the younger Tsc and Tp units are characterized
    by distinct rhythmic bedding and are often gently folded and fractured. Unit Tu
    refers to seafloor outcrops that may include unit Tm, unit Tsm, or unit Tsc. The
    Santa Cruz Mudstone and underlying Santa Margarita Sandstone at Double Point are
    more than 450 m thick in an oil test well (Clark and Brabb, 1997), and these units
    form coastal bluffs and tidal zone exposures that extend onto the adjacent bedrock
    shelf. The Santa Cruz Mudstone thins markedly to the northwest and disappears from
    the section about 10 km to the northwest where Purisima Formation unconformably
    overlies Santa Margarita Sandstone. We infer the offshore contact between the Santa
    Cruz Mudstone and Purisima Formation based on an angular unconformity visible in
    seismic data just southeast of the map area. This angular unconformity becomes conformable
    to the northwest in the Drakes Bay and Vicinity map area. We suggest this contact
    bends northward in the subsurface and comes onshore near U-Ranch (Galloway, 1977;
    Clark and Brabb, 1997). Given the lack of lithological evidence for this contact
    offshore Double Point, this interpretation is speculative, and an alternative interpretation
    is that the noted unconformity occurs within the Santa Cruz Mudstone. For this reason,
    we have queried unit Tp here to indicate this uncertainty. Modern nearshore sediments
    are mostly sand (unit Qms) and a mix of sand, gravel, and cobbles (units Qmsc and
    Qmsd). The more coarse-grained sands and gravels (units Qmsc and Qmsd) are primarily
    recognized on the basis of bathymetry and high backscatter (see Bathymetry--Drakes
    Bay, California and Backscattter A to C--Drakes Bay, California, DS 781, for more
    information). Both Qmsc and Qmsd typically have abrupt landward contacts with bedrock
    and form irregular to lenticular exposures that are commonly elongate in the shore-normal
    direction. Contacts between units Qmsc and Qms are typically gradational. Unit Qmsd
    forms erosional lags in scoured depressions that are bounded by relatively sharp
    and less commonly diffuse contacts with unit Qms horizontal sand sheets. These depressions
    are typically a few tens of centimeters deep and range in size from a few 10's of
    meters to more than 1 km2. There are two areas of high-backscatter, and rough seafloor
    that are notable in that each includes several small (less than about 20,000 m2),
    irregular "lumps", with as much as 1 m of positive relief above the seafloor (unit
    Qsr). Southeast of the Point Reyes headland, unit Qsr occurs in water depths between
    50 and 60 meters, with individual lumps randomly distributed to west-trending. Southwest
    of Double Point, unit Qsr occurs in water depths between 30 and 40 meters, with
    individual lumps having a more northwest trend. Seismic-reflection data (see field
    activity S-8-09-NC) reveal this lumpy material rests on several meters of latest
    Pleistocene to Holocene sediment and is thus not bedrock outcrop. Rather, it seems
    likely that this lumpy material is marine debris, possibly derived from one (or
    more) of the more than 60 shipwrecks offshore of the Point Reyes Peninsula between
    1849 and 1940 (National Park Service, 2012). It is also conceivable that this lumpy
    terrane consists of biological "hardgrounds". Video transect data crossing unit
    Qsr near the Point Reyes headland was of insufficient quality to distinguish between
    these above alternatives. A transition to more fine-grained marine sediments (unit
    Qmsf) occurs around 50-60 m depth south of the Point Reyes headland and west of
    Double Point, however, directly south and east of Drakes Estero estuary, backscatter
    and seafloor sediment samples (Chin and others, 1997) suggest fine-grained sediments
    extend into water depths as shallow as 30 m. Unit Qmsf is commonly extensively bioturbated
    and consists primarily of mud and muddy sand. These fine-grained sediments are inferred
    to have been derived from the Drakes and Limantour Esteros or from the San Francisco
    Bay to the south, via predominantly northwest flow at the seafloor (Noble and Gelfenbaum,
    1990). References Cited Catuneanu, O., 2006, Principles of Sequence Stratigraphy:
