    files (.dbf) are an extract of selectedn          geographic and cartographic information
    from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
    Encoding and Referencingn          (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents
    a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line
    shapefile isn          designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they
    can be combined to cover the entire nation.n          n          The American Indian/Alaska
    Native/Native Hawaiian (AIANNH) Areas Shapefile includes the following legal entities:
    federally recognized American Indiann          reservations and off-reservation
    trust land areas, state-recognized American Indian reservations, and Hawaiian home
    lands (HHLs).  The statistical entitiesn          included are Alaska Native village
    statistical areas (ANVSAs), Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs), tribal designated
    statistical areas (TDSAs), andn          state designated tribal statistical areas
    (SDTSAs).  Joint use areas are also included in this shapefile refer to areas that
    are administered jointly and/orn          claimed by two or more American Indian
    tribes.  The Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas
    as unique geographic entities for then          purpose of presenting statistical
    data.  Note that tribal subdivisions and Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs)
    are additional types of Americann          Indian/Alaska Native areas stored by
    the Census Bureau, but are displayed in separate shapefiles because of how they
    fall within the Census Bureau'sn          geographic hierarchy.n          n          The
    State of Hawaii's Office of Hawaiian Home Lands provides the legal boundaries for
    the HHLs. The boundaries for ANVSAs, OTSAs, and TDSAs were delineatedn          for
    the 2010 Census through the Tribal Statistical Areas Program (TSAP) by participants
    from the federally recognized tribal governments.  The Bureau ofn          Indian
    Affairs (BIA) within the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) provides the list
    of federally recognized tribes and only provides legal boundaryn          information
    when the tribes need supporting records, if a boundary is based on treaty or another
    document that is historical or open to legal interpretation,n          or when another
    tribal, state, or local government challenges the depiction of a reservation or
    off-reservation trust land.n          n          The boundaries for federally recognized
    American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands are as of January 1
    of the public shapefile release year,n          as reported by the federally recognized
    tribal governments through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).n
            n         The boundaries for state-recognized American Indian reservations
