    Program (CRCP) long-term goals for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, towed-diver surveys (aka. towboard surveys) were conducted by the
    Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science
    Center (PIFSC) as part of biennial Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program
    (RAMP) Cruises. 23 towboard surveys (49.69 km in length), were conducted at Pearl
    & Hermes during the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands RAMP Cruise HA1007 from 20100904
    to 20100929. Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description
    of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied
    reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and
    abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., Crown of Thorns sea stars, giant
    clams), and for assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba
    divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch
    at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15 m. Each survey is 50 min
    long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments.
    The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes
    (greater than 50 cm total length) seen within 5 m either side and 10 m in front
    of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish
    towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record
    the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae,
    estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates
    including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped
    with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15-second
    intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other
    benthic components. Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth
    sensors set to record at 5-second intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey
    track is recorded at 5-second intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS)
    receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately
    map the position of the divers with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm
    calculates the position of the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking
    into account the length of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature
    of the survey track. This metadata applies to the benthic characterization observations.",nt"license_title":
