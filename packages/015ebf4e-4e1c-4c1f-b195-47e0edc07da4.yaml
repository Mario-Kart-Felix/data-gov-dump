    Refuge in 1936 included the construction of eight upland game shelters. These were
    supplied with gravel and occasionally checked to see if any of the upland game species
    used them. Evidence indicated that pheasants and partridge used the shelters but
    little during the following winter (1936-37). Since it was believed that adequate
    natural foods were available, no winter feeding was done. In the fall of 1937 winter
    feed was put out at five new stations and five of the previously constructed shelters.
    The stations were supplied with shelled corn and barley in six-bushel hoppers. Ear
    corn was available from spikes sent into poles leaned against the uprights of the
    shelter. The top of most of the shelters was covered with corn stalks with the ears
    pushed through the sides and lower end where birds could reach them. Some corn stalks
    were forced into the combination wind breaks and snow fences to the northwest of
    the shelters. Gravel was supplied in a pile within the shelters. In addition to
    the feeding stations there were two corn fields left as winter food. These had been
    used extensively by mallards during the fall months but provided food throughout
    the winter. With the purpose in mind of comparing the use of shelters during the
    two years, to determine whether or not predatory species were attracted, if so their
    relation to game species, and something of the winter requirements of game birds
    in the region, weekly visits were made to the feeding stations. The visits were
    started early in December and continued into March. In January we began trapping
    and banding grouse, to secure data on migration, if possible, and it was decided
    to extend the original studies to include winter activities and habits of the grouse.
    Due to the fact that the winter months were pretty well past before the grouse studies
    were initiated, only a few notes of interest were made. The author has examined
    what literature was available for comparison and for direction of future work in
    this field.",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
