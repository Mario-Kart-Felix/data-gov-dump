    Models or DEMs) of Cape Cod National Seashore were produced from remotely-sensed,
    geographically-referenced elevation measurements in cooperation with NASA and NPS.
    Point data in ascii text files were interpolated in a GIS to create a grid or digital
    elevation model (DEM) of each beach surface. Elevation measurements were collected
    in Massachusetts, over Cape Cod National Seashore using the NASA Experimental Advanced
    Airborne Research LiDAR (EAARL), a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an
    aircraft to measure ground elevation and coastal topography. The system uses high
    frequency laser beams directed at the earth's surface through an opening in the
    bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference
    between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal
    in the aircraft. The plane travels over the beach at approximately 60 meters per
    second while surveying from the low-water line to the landward base of the sand
    dunes. The EAARL, developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) located at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, measures ground elevation
    with a vertical resolution of 15 centimeters. A sampling rate of 3 kHz or higher
    results in an extremely dense spatial elevation data set. Over 100 kilometers of
    coastline can be easily surveyed within a 3- to 4-hour mission time period. The
    ability to sample large areas rapidly and accurately is especially useful in morphologically
    dynamic areas such as barrier beaches. Quick assessment of topographic change can
    be made following storms comparing measurements against baseline data. When subsequent
    elevation maps for an area are analyzed, they provide a useful tool to make management
    decisions regarding coastal development. For more information on Lidar science and
    the Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL) system and surveys, see
