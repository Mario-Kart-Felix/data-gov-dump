    m) in the U.S. Central Lowlands. There is one file for each treatment area (ungrazed
    and lightly grazed). The third file contains monthly and annual climate data from
    weather station at Pawhuska, Oklahoma (36.67 N, -96.35 W, Elevation of 255 m) near
    Osage.Dynamics of above- and below-ground plant biomass were monitored by harvest
    technique at roughly 2-week intervals during the growing season for the years 1970-1972.
    Data on above-ground live biomass, standing dead matter, and litter are available
    for two replications each at recently grazed and an "ungrazed" (relatively undisturbed)
    grassland sites at Osage. Below-ground biomass was sampled at 0-30 cm and 0-90 cm
    depths. The data were collected as part of a coordinated study over 1-3 years at
    ten grassland sites of the central and western United States, under the US Grassland
    Biome Project of the International Biological Program (IBP). Annual above-ground
    net primary production (ANPP) was estimated conservatively by summing peak biomass
    of individual species (346 g/m2/yr), and annual below-ground net primary production
    (BNPP) was estimated as the sum of positive increments in root biomass (including
    crown biomass) (542 g/m2/yr). ",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
