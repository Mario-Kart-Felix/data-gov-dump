	"notes": "This map portrays the location, type, and chemical nature (\"tribe\") of oil samples along the Central and Southern California coast, including tar on beaches, seafloor oil seeps, and oil produced from platforms. Most of the data originated as part of the joint BOEM\/USGS-sponsored studies entitled Natural Offshore Oil Seepage and Related Tarball Accumulation on the California Coastline - Santa Barbara Channel and the Southern Santa Maria Basin; Source Identification and Inventory (USGS Open-File Report 2009-1225 and OCS Study MMS 2009-030) and Biomarker Chemistry and Flux Quantification Methods for Natural Petroleum Seeps and Produced Oils, Offshore Southern California (USGS Scientific Investigations Report 2011-5210 and OCS Study BOEM 2011-016). Additional data are from USGS's library of previously collected samples.\n\nNatural oil seepage occurs in the waters of southern California. Active oil extraction and shipping is occurring concurrently within the region and it is of great interest to resource managers to be able to distinguish between natural seepage and anthropogenic oil spillage. In support of these studies, USGS collected and analyzed almost 700 samples from the Santa Barbara Channel and southern Santa Maria basin and for comparison, other California sites between 1996 and 2007. Samples were collected from submarine and cliff seeps, from representative production zones from existing OCS oil and gas producing facilities or onshore facilities, and from random beached tarball samples. The beached tarball samples were collected as part of a County of Santa Barbara-sponsored study of 10 Santa Barbara County beaches. Additional samples were collected between 2008 and 2010.\n\nThis metadata file describes the samples used in the studies and includes a subset of the attributes from Appendices 2-1 and 3-1 of USGS Open-File Report 2009-1225, and from Table 1 of USGS Scientific Investigations Report 2011-5210.",
