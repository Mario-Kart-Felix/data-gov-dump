    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The proposed research innovation will create
    a low-cost, intuitive means for people to have multi-fingered interaction with Robonaut
    2 and training simulations via tactile shear feedback. This work builds on the PI's
    prior university research.  Tactile shear feedback imparts friction and shear forces
    to the user's hand via sliding plates that are built into the handle of the grasped
    device. These sliding plates rub against the user's skin and induce in-hand friction
    forces to create perceived force/torque-like sensations despite not being connected
    to a fixed surface. Translational motions and forces can be portrayed along the
    length of the handle by moving the sliding plates in unison in the corresponding
    direction; whereas moving the plates at opposing locations in the handle in opposite
    directions creates the feeling of the device's handle wrenching within the user's
    grasp.  rnrnTo this novel form of haptic feedback, the PI proposes to add a more
    intuitive means for a user to interact with virtual and teleoperated environments
    by allowing the user to open and close his/her grasp as he/she would naturally do
    when grasping an object.  It is hypothesized that adding the ability for the user
    to interact by opening and closing his/her grasp will provide improved interaction
    performance and be preferred by users. The proposed work also creates the ability
    to individually control the fingers on multi-fingered robot hands like those on
    Robonaut 2.  rnrnOur developed haptic interface will provide a low-cost means for
    mission scientists, astronauts, and others to interact with Robonaut 2. The developed
    interface will also provide greater access for planning and training of EVAs, and
    could provide a more intuitive interface for ground personnel to operate and supervise
    robots. Furthermore, the developed system's low cost would also permit it to be
    used directly in NASA outreach / STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, &amp; Math)
    activities.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
