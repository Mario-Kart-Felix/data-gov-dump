    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    in text format (.txt). The files provide biomass estimates, soil carbon (C), nitrogen
    (N), and phosphorus (P) measurements made at an artificially-established grassland
    savanna study site in Towoomba, South Africa. The study site was part of a long-term
    experiment to test the effect of fertilizer application. Biomass data are available
    for the years 1950-1981 (data are not available for 1976 or 1977); soil C, N, and
    P data are available for the years 1949, 1962, 1980, and 1990. The 1949 estimates
    were inferred in 1990 from undisturbed savanna adjacent to the experiment. The savanna-fertilizer
    experiment was several hectares in extent, with five levels of nitrogen and three
    levels of phosphorus laid out in a randomized block design on an area from which
    all trees were removed. The ammonium sulphate and superphosphate fertilizers were
    added during November (50% of total), January (25%) and February (25%). The response
    to N fertilizer saturated at higher levels, so data from only six (3 x 2) of the
    15 possible treatment combinations are provided.Above-ground biomass was sampled
    by mowing to 5-cm height. It was assumed that 50 g/m2 was left in the field, plus
    an additional 5% of the mowed dry weight. Revision Notes: Only the documentation
    for this data set has been modified. The data files have been checked for accuracy
    and are identical to those originally published. ",nt"owner_org": "d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed",nt"extras":
