	"notes": "This data set contains three ASCII files (.txt format). Two files contain above- and below-ground biomass and productivity data for the Osage tallgrass prairie study site (36.95 N, -96.55 W, Elevation 392 m) in the U.S. Central Lowlands. There is one file for each treatment area (ungrazed and lightly grazed). The third file contains monthly and annual climate data from weather station at Pawhuska, Oklahoma (36.67 N, -96.35 W, Elevation of 255 m) near Osage.Dynamics of above- and below-ground plant biomass were monitored by harvest technique at roughly 2-week intervals during the growing season for the years 1970-1972. Data on above-ground live biomass, standing dead matter, and litter are available for two replications each at recently grazed and an \"ungrazed\" (relatively undisturbed) grassland sites at Osage. Below-ground biomass was sampled at 0-30 cm and 0-90 cm depths. The data were collected as part of a coordinated study over 1-3 years at ten grassland sites of the central and western United States, under the US Grassland Biome Project of the International Biological Program (IBP). Annual above-ground net primary production (ANPP) was estimated conservatively by summing peak biomass of individual species (346 g\/m2\/yr), and annual below-ground net primary production (BNPP) was estimated as the sum of positive increments in root biomass (including crown biomass) (542 g\/m2\/yr).

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
