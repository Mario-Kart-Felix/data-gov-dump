  with 2x2 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of a selected portion of seafloor
  southwest of Vieques Island, derived from data collected in March and April 2009.
  NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy
  Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry
  data around Vieques Island from 3/26/09 to 4/2/09. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted
  Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) for water depths greater
  than 75 meters, and with a moon pool flange-mounted Reson 7125 multibeam echosounder
  (dual frequecy, 200/400 kHz) for water depths of less than 75 meters. It was processed
  by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied
  (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using
  final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum
  NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based
  on swath angle. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened
  in ESRI ArcMap 9.x as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature
  to Raster' was used to generate the final ESRI Grid. The project was conducted to
  meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth.
  All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to
  their own needs and standards.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\":
