    1 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of an inshore portion of the NPS's
    Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument, south of St. John, US Virgin Islands.
    NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy
    Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry
    data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted
    Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor
    using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound
    velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved
    tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The
    processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle.
    An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9
    as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster' was used
    to generate the final ESRI Grid. The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and
    2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should
    individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs
    and standards.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key": "bbox-east-long",ntt"value":
