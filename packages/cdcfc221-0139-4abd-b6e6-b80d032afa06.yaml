    simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census Bureau's
    Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing
    (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed for
    small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the
    intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain
    the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas
    may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available
    as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.nnCensus
    tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent
    entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant
    Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations
    where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined
    to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set
    of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous
    decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200
    and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  When first delineated,
    census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics,
    economic status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies
    widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns
    caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary
    revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population
    growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract
    boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow
    legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries
    in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships
    where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State
    and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census
    geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous
    areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive
    with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the
    2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census
    tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000
    data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian
    reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899
    was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and
    represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military
    installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998
    was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.",nt"license_title":
