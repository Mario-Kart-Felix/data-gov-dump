    across 4,918 acres in the Saddle Mountain Unit of the Hanford Reach National Monument,
    which included parts of the Priest Rapids Bar and Vernita Basin. Burned Area Emergency
    Rehabilitation (BAER) treatments undertaken the following winter were aerial seeding
    the entire area with a variety of native species and drill-seeding and planting
    shrub starts in selected sites. In addition to the seeding and planting treatments,
    the entire burned area was treated with an aerial application of Roundup PROu00a9
    (4 fl. Oz. /acre) with the goal of controlling cheatgrass long enough to enhance
    establishment of the seeded/planted species. Much of the area was extremely vulnerable
    to wind erosion, particularly areas that hadnu2019t burned in recent years and that
    had captured abundant loess. Windblown sediments caused u2018brown-outsu2019 on
    occasion after the fire. One particularly susceptible area directly upwind from
    State Highway 24 was aerially hydro-mulched in an attempt to stabilize it.The dynamics
    of the post-fire vegetation and effectiveness of the BAER treatments was monitored
    for the first two growing seasons after the fire, during which quantitative and
    qualitative assessments were made of the treatment success (Easterly and Salstrom
    2009). The assessments included revisiting existing vegetation plots (established
    in support of Ernst and Holmes 2012) and using the fine-scale vegetation map that
    had been created using both remote imagery and extensive field reconnaissance (Easterly
    and Salstrom 2004). In addition, a library of photo points that was created during
    the mapping project, together with some photos available from the previous plot
    work (Ernest and Holmes 2012), helped document pre- and post-fire vegetation trends
    from which to assess the effects of the BAER treatments. Results of that initial
    monitoring effort were reported in Easterly and Salstrom (2009).Since the vegetation
    was clearly still in flux after the initial monitoring project, additional monitoring
    was undertaken in 2012 to better assess the longer-term effects of rehabilitation
    treatment on the vegetative structure within the burned area. The results of that
    monitoring effort are the subject of this report. In addition, rare plant occurrences
    located on and near the fire were revisited.",nt"license_title": "License
