    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Development of airborne and spaceborne laser
    systems dictates a number of extremely challenging requirements for such fine optical
    devices. These requirements include minimizing weight and volume, increasing of
    power and brightness, high tolerance to mechanical and acoustic vibrations and ionizing
    radiation. Solid state lasers provide the best parameters which are necessary for
    free space optical communications, remote sensing, etc. However, all such lasers
    require fine alignment and, therefore, are very sensitive to vibrations, thermal
    gradients, etc. The ideal situation would be if all elements of a laser would be
    incorporated in the volume of a gain medium. We propose a completely new approach
    to the problem. Researchers at CREOL have demonstrated that it is possible to produce
    co-doping of a photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass with Nd. It was found that absorption
    and luminescence properties of Nd in PTR glass are the same as for all silicate
    glasses. It is important that this type of silicate glass can be successfully doped
    with all rare earth ions, e.g. with Nd, Yb, Er, Tm, etc. At the same time, it was
    shown that PTR glass keeps it photosensitivity. This means that it is possible to
    record volume holograms in this material. A combination of good lasing properties
    and phase photosensitivity enables a new approach to all-solid-state laser. It became
    possible to record volume Bragg gratings in the volume of laser glass. In this case,
    all alignment will be done in the process of recording and no misalignment is possible
    in any conditions of exploitation. Thus, the proposed approach enables creation
    of a monolithic solid state laser. We expect to study luminescence properties and
    develop a technology of recording Bragg mirrors in the volume of gain medium and
    demonstrate diode pumped lasing in Phase I project. In the case of success, we expect
    to study semiconductor crystals precipitation in PTR glass and demonstrate a monolithic
    pulsed laser in Phase II project.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
