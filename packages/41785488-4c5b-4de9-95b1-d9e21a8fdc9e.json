	"notes": "The California Native Plant Society (CNPS) Vegetation Program produced a vegetation map and classification for approximately 11,600 acres primarily within Millerton Lake East SW quarter quadrangle (Fresno and Madera Counties, California) and including the large table mountains east of Millerton Lake. CNPS delineated vegetation polygons using 2009 NAIP aerial imagery and CNPS survey data collected between 2008 to 2010. The mapped area includes the McKenzie Preserve at Table Mountain managed by the Sierra Foothills Conservancy, as well as other lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, California Department of Fish and Game, Department of Parks and Recreation for Millerton State Recreation Area, and private land owners. The vegetation classification of 47 native vegetation alliances and semi-natural stands was based on data within the southern Sierra Nevada Foothills Ecoregion across a larger area of approximately 300,000 acres including portions of Mariposa, Madera, and Fresno Counties. The vegetation map resulted in 26 types of mapping units including alliance-level vegetation types from the floristic classification within the focused study area.",
