    to electrolysis, the water generated as an intermediate product must be treated
    to remove absorbed hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids, byproducts derived from
    trace amounts of fluoride and chloride present in lunar regolith. In terrestrial
    applications, removal of chloride and fluoride from water is a relatively trivial
    process due to the availability of consumable adsorbents, or by utilizing other
    processes that require frequent regeneration. None of these processes are applicable
    in the lunar environment, however, where resources are scarce.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We
    previously studied Nafion, a commercially-available sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene
    polymer membrane, as an ISRU filtration material because it can continuously facilitate
    water transport and acid rejection without the need for replacement or regeneration.
    While Nafion showed promise as a filtration membrane, it was unable to remove sufficient
    quantities of contaminants, particularly fluoride, and would require very large
    membrane contact areas to generate appreciable quantities of clean water. Electrodialysis
    was chosen as an alternative water purification process for the present study, due
    to its extensive industrial pedigree and demonstrated ability to rapidly produce
    a clean water supply and concentrated waste brine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrodialysis
    uses the principle of ion exchange. An electrodialysys stack contains alternating
    cation and anion exchange membranes between two electrodes, with fluid-containing
    channels between each. Initially contaminated feed (diluent) and initially clean
    waste (concentrate) solutions are passed through every other chamber as direct current
    is applied across the electrodes. Anionic contaminants in the diluent solution diffuse
    across the anion exchange membrane toward the anode (positively charged electrode),
    while cationic contaminants diffuse across the cation exchange membrane toward the
    cathode (negatively charged electrode). The ionic species become trapped in the
    concentrate solution, as the current directs anions toward cation exchange membranes
    through which they cannot diffuse, and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When dissolved
    in water, HCl and HF dissociate into their individual ionic species, i.e. H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,
    Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. As a strong acid, HCl
    fully dissociates into its respective ions, while HF, a weak acid, only partially
    dissociates in an equilibrium process. It is therefore expected that HCl will rapidly
    and nearly completely diffuse from the diluent to the concentrate stream, while
    HF will diffuse into the concentrate stream more slowly, as the gradual removal
    of fluoride ions will allow more HF to dissociate and be removed from the diluent
    stream. It is also expected that as the ion concentration in the concentrate stream
    increases, osmotic pressure will drive water from the diluent to the concentrate
    stream over time, reducing the yield of clean water. As a result, experiments focused
    on optimizing both the quantity of chloride and fluoride ions removed from the diluent
    stream, and the rapidity of ion transfer.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title": "U.S.

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
