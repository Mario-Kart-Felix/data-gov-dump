    rovers to improve the productivity and safety of human explorers. A key challenge
    in using robots for human exploration is orienting remote personnel about robot
    operations, as latency and communication constraints make eyes-on monitoring impractical.
    Summary measures are needed to identify what progress the robot has made and, when
    progress is impeded, to indicate what went wrong. Trending measures also are needed
    that determine how well robotic assets are being utilized and identify opportunities
    to improve robot productivity. TRACLabs and Brigham Young University propose to
    develop software for anytime summarization to orient personnel quickly about the
    performance of planetary robots operating remotely, when data are limited, interrupted,
    or delayed. Thus an anytime summary must support personnel in understanding the
    operational situation without relying on vigilance monitoring. rnrnWe successfully
    completed all Phase I objectives. We designed an approach for developing an anytime
    summarization web application. We identified candidate use cases to support Intelligent
    Robotics Group (IRG) tests. We designed and prototyped algorithms to summarize robot
    performance. We designed a web application with a graphical narrative interface
    (GNI) for exploring anytime summaries for different uses and perspectives. This
    web application integrates these interface clients with a performance data server
    and with the IRG Exploration Ground Data System (xGDS). In Phase II we will implement
    this Phase I design as a web application for anytime summarization. This software
    will compute and present information about robot performance including key performance
    indicators, significant events affecting performance, and expected performance under
    different operational conditions. It will build a new performance database for use
    by web clients, such as the GNI. This web application will be evaluated for use
    with NASA robots as part of the IRG xGDS.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
