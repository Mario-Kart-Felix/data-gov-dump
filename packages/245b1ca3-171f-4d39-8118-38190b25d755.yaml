    is located in Virginia along the Potomac River, about 35.4 kilometers (22 miles)
    southwest of Washington, D.C. The 66.3 hectare (164 acre) refuge was acquired in
    1979 as a portion of the Mason Neck NWR complex. The overall objective of this investigation
    was to gather baseline information on the contaminant status of the area. These
    data are needed to identify possible sources of contaminants; assess risks to aquatic
    life and piscivorous wildlife; and, if necessary, develop source control strategies.
    Neabsco Creek, which borders the refuge, and Farm Creek, which bisects it, were
    the primary study sites. In 1991, sediments, channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus),
    and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were sampled for organic and inorganic
    contaminants. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels in channel catfish muscle tissues
    averaged 1.74 ppm in Farm Creek and 2.45 ppm in Neabsco Creek. Four of the six samples
    from Neabsco Creek and 2/6 samples from Farm Creek had PCB concentrations exceeding
    the 2 ppm FDA tolerance. Mean PCB concentrations in largemouth bass from Farm and
    Neabsco Creeks were 0.28 ppm and 0.12 ppm, respectively. Sediments did not contain
    detectable concentrations of PCBs. In view of these data and the propensity of these
    species to move in and out of the creeks, the concentrations are viewed as representative
    of regional rather than highly localized inputs. During the study, there were observations
    of external lesions in channel catfish and brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus),
    which merited a follow-up study. In 1992, the prevalence of lesions in 2930 brown
    bullhead collected from each of these creeks and from Marumsco Creek (1.75 km upstream)
    was determined. Coincident with the fish sampling, concentrations of polynuclear
    aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in sediments were measured since PAH-contaminated sediments
    have been associated with an increased prevalence of cancerous lesions in this species.
    The average concentration of total carcinogenic PAHs in sediments was: Farm Creek
    (0.34 ppm) < Marumsco Creek (0.63 ppm) < Neabsco Creek (1.37 ppm). The prevalence
    of lesions between the three creeks was compared with the ranking of average carcinogenic
    PAHs in sediments, using the Jongheere-Terpstra test. A significant test (p<0.05)
    indicated that the prevalence of a lesion increased in the same order as the mean
    levels of carcinogenic PAHs. The prevalence of skin neoplasms (squamous carcinomas
    and papillomas) was 3.4` in Farm Creek, 16.6% in Marumsco Creek, and 33.3% in Neabsco
    Creek. This ranking and the rankings of the total number of fish with tumors, invasive
    tumors, or non-parasitic lesions followed the trend in sediment carcinogenic PAHs
    according to the Jongheere-Terpstra test. The prevalence of liver carcinomas (0%
    at Farm Creek, 3.3% at Marumsco Creek, and 10% at Neabsco Creek) was of borderline
    significance (p=0.06). A possible source of PAHs in Neabsco Creek is a complex of
    three adjacent marinas, containing a fueling station and about 400 slips. The highest
    sediment concentrations of total PAHs (25.5 ppm) and total carcinogenic PAHs (2.70
    ppm) were found in the station closest to the complex. The tumor prevalence and
    sediment concentration data were compared with data from studies in the Great Lakes
    region. It is recommended that further sampling take place in Neabsco creek to determine
    the extent of PAH contamination. Source controls should have the objective of reducing
    any continuing inputs.",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras":
