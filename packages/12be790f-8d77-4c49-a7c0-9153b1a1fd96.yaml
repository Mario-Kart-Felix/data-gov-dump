  gnatcatcher (CAGN) has become both the flagship species and an umbrella species
  identified with conservation, where the goal is to have persistent populations maintained
  within a preserve system. Estimating gnatcatcher distribution and abundance is important
  to these planning efforts, as well as for maintaining this species. Estimates of
  these parameters are used to establish baseline numbers to assess direct loss, identify
  areas for conservation and to track regional gnatcatcher population trends. In 2002
  the Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife Office (CFWO) conducted a region-wide survey for
  CAGN across its range in Orange and San Diego Counties in attempt to obtain estimates
  for the percent area occupied and abundance of CAGN on lands held in the public
  trust (see ds196). The results of this study were used to develop a monitoring program
  of CAGN population trends. In 2004, monitoring addressed presence/absence and abundance
  of CAGN on MSCP preserved lands and provided an initial estimate of CAGN population
  trends. In addition, the study collected baseline data to monitor the recovery of
  CAGN populations that were impacted by the fires in 2004 (Winchell and Doherty 2005).
  In 2007, the CFWO received funding from SANDAG to conduct the first comprehensive
  survey county-wide for CAGN. The study area in 2007 was strictly limited to lands
  within San Diego County currently regulated as preserve lands under an approved
  Habitat Conservation Plan, other public lands, Marine Corps Air Station Miramar
  and Naval Weapons Station Fallbrook. Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton was not included
  because of logistical considerations. Additionally, private lands and tribal lands
  were excluded from the 2007 study. In 2009, the same protocol was used but different
  sampling points were surveyed due to changes in land access and the 2007 fires.
  This dataset was compiled as part of the Southern California Data Integration Project
  and presents the results of the 2004, 2007 and 2009 CAGN monitoring efforts. For
  the 2004 monitoring season, a GIS coverage of MSCP lands was combined with polygons
  described as CAGN habitat by the TAIC model (TAIC 2002). Points from a 600-m by
  600-m fishnet grid were dropped on top of these areas, centered on a random point
  and rotated by random number of degrees. Areas with habitat access were then queried
  out from this coverage and the survey sample points were then randomly selected
  from the final fishnode coverage. In order to determine which survey points were
  in burn areas, a coverage of the 2003 Cedar Fire burn area was joined to the survey
  points fishnode coverage. In 2007, the fishnet grid was overlaid on a GIS map of
  San Diego County and merged with a land ownership layer as well as with the grid
  layer of the TAIC model. Coverage data of the 2003 fires was also merged with the
  grid layer. Survey points were randomly selected from this layer where habitat access
  was identified as \"Yes\". Points were placed 600-m apart to avoid double counting
  birds. For the 2009 surveys, the 2007 fire data was incorporated into the GIS analysis
  in order to exclude sampling points that fell within habitats burned in 2007. In
  addition, land access data was updated to reflect changes in site access since 2007.
  In 2004, surveys were conducted between March 14 and April 19 and in 2007, surveys
  were conducted between April 3 and June 8. In 2009, surveys were conducted between
  April 13 and June 18, 2009 with an additional survey conducted on August 24, 2009.
  Surveys ranged from 5-8 days apart. In 2004, a total of 224 sampling points were
  surveyed and in 2007, a total of 409 sampling points were surveyed (Winchell and
  Doherty 2005). In 2009, 443 sampling points were surveyed. At the beginning of a
  survey, environmental data were recorded using a Kestral. Surveys were conducted
  over six 3-minute sampling periods. A call back tape was played during the last
  3-minute period. The exact time (min and sec) of detection, distance and angle to
  each CAGN was recorded for each 3-minute period. In 2007, incidental observations
  of CAGN seen or heard on the way to the survey point or during set up where also
  recorded, these observations were noted as survey elapsed time of 0:00. During the
  survey observers visually tracked birds to help control for double counting, and
  any points of confusion were noted. Whenever possible, age (adult or juvenile) and
  sex of the bird were noted. REFERENCES Technology Associates International Corporation.
