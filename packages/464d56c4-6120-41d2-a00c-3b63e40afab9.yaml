    data asset contains summary information on selected air permitting actions from
    EPA, state, and local permitting agencies across the U.S., as well as a number of
    international permit records supplied by air pollution control agencies in Mexico
    and Canada. The acronyms refer to program requirements of the New Source Review
    (NSR) program: RACT is Reasonably Available Control Technology and applies to existing
    sources in areas that are not meeting national ambient air quality standards (i.e.,
    non-attainment areas); BACT is Best Available Control Technology and applies to
    major new or modified sources in clean areas (i.e., attainment areas). LAER, or
    Lowest Achievable Emission Rate, is required on major new or modified sources in
    non-attainment areas. As of 2012, RBLC includes approximately 6,500 entries. With
    the exception of LAER permit determinations, whose inclusion in RBLC is mandatory,
    participation is voluntary. Coverage is therefore not complete or necessarily representative.Required
    under Section 108 of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, RBLC provides users
    ?? typically permit writers, permit applicants or holders, and the public ?? with
    references and personal contacts to support ongoing air pollution control activities.
    Information is detailed enough for users to know whether a permit is applicable
    to their needs. Users may then contact the appropriate agency to access the permit
    or discuss it with agency staff.RBLC-referenced permits cover Criteria Air Pollutants
    (CAPs) and Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs), but the data is also searchable for
    Greenhouse Gas (GHG) references. Entries are generally provided by the original
    permitting agency, though EPA Regional Offices may enter data on behalf of state
    and local agencies to augment coverage. Since 2009, Canadian and Mexican agencies
    have had access to the RBLC to submit their own permit information; all data is
    provided in English.There are three main levels of information ?? Facility, Process,
    and Pollutant. Facility Data includes but is not limited to: Facility Name, City/Town,
    State, Permitting Agency, Permit Date, NAICS, SIC, Facility Registry System Number,
    Permit Number, and Agency Contact Name & Phone Number. Process Data includes but
    is not limited to: Process Name, Process Type Code, and Throughput. Pollutant Data
    includes but is not limited to: Pollutant Name, CAS#, Emissions Testing Method(s),
    Emission Limits, Case-by-Case Basis and any Other Applicable Requirements; and Control
    Method Description. U.S. geographic coverage includes all states and territories,
    plus all U.S. permitted facilities within U.S. waters (generally 3 miles for state
    limits, but further offshore for DOI-permitted oil platforms). Coverage began in
    1980, but some historical permits from the 1970s are included. Over the years the
    data has been converted from paper to searchable digital form. Data is not overwritten,
    so multiple historical permit references for a single facility may be included.
    OAQPS manually cross-references RBLC references to the appropriate Facility Registry
    System (FRS) ID to the extent possible. All RBLC content is public and non-sensitive
    and available through EPA.gov after it has been quality assured. Data is quality
    assured by EPA and entered into the RACT, BACT, LAER Clearinghouse (RBLC) data management
    system (http://cfpub.epa.gov/rblc/index.cfm?action=Home.Home). Where technical summaries
    appear inaccurate, OAQPS returns entries for review to their originators. All data
    is edited and approved by the Office of Air and Radiation??s Office of Air Quality
    Permits and Standards (OAQPS) prior to publication.",nt"license_title": "Other
