    data products for four study areas across the Brazilian Amazon: Manaus, Amazonas;
    Tapajos National Forest, Para Western (Santarem); Rio Branco, Acre; and Rondonia,
    Rondonia. Products include vector data showing (1) roads, (2) rivers, and (3) hypsography
    and (4) digital elevation model (DEM) images that were encoded from the hypsography
    vectors. There are 15 data files with this data set which includes 12 compressed
    *.zip files containing ArcInfo shape files and 3 GeoTIFFS.This data set contains
    vector data showing roads, rivers, and hypsography for each study area in ESRI ArcGIS
    shapefile format. The vectors were hand-digitized by the Images Company in Brazil
    from paper maps produced by the Brazilian government. Depending on the scale of
    the original maps, the digitization errors vary. For some maps, some vectors are
    missing. Data were manually checked for duplicate or extra vectors. These data sets
    were derived from several map sheets produced from aerial coverages dating from
    1974 to 1978.The DEM images were encoded from the hypsography vectors and are provided
    in GeoTIFF format. The attribute value associated with each line and point in the
    vector segment is encoded into the image channel; the image channel is then filled
    in by interpolating image data between encoded vector data.  For each DEM:  1 image
    channel with pixel resolution = 25m x 25m.  DEM images are provided for Manaus,
    Tapajos National Forest, and Rondonia.  The files for Rio Branco were unusable due
    to a documentation error.DATA QUALITY STATEMENT: The Data Center has determined
    that there are questions about the quality of the data reported in this data set.
    The data set has missing or incomplete data, metadata, or other documentation that
    diminishes the usability of the products. KNOWN PROBLEMS:The data providers note
    that due to limited resources, these data have been neither validated nor quality-assured
    for general use. For that reason, extreme caution is advised when considering the
    use of these data. - Any use of the derived data is not recommended because the
    results have not been validated.- However, the DEM, vectors, and orthorectified
    SAR data (related data set) can be used if the user understands how these were produced
    and accepts the limitations.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
