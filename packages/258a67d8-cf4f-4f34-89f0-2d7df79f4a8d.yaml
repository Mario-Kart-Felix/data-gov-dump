    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The National Geodetic Survey (NGS), formerly
    part of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, has been performing Aeronautical surveys
    since the 1920's. NGS, in accordance with a series of interagency agreements with
    the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), provides airport geodetic control, runway,
    navigational aid, obstruction and other aeronautical data that is critical to the
    operation of the National Airspace System (NAS). The FAA uses the data to develop
    instrument approach and departure procedures, determine maximum takeoff weights,
    update aeronautical publications, and airport planning and engineering studies.Most
    of this data is source information obtained using field and photogrammetric survey
    methods. NGS acquires aerial photography of most commercial and many general aviation
    airports in the United States to support several types of aeronautical surveys,
    including Airport Obstruction Chart (AOC), Operational Evolution Plan (OEP), and
    Congressional (CGR) and, until recently, Area Navigation Approach (ANA). The high
    resolution photographs are used to perform a photogrammetric analysis of the Obstruction
    Identification Surface (OIS), determine areas obstructing the OIS, delineate aircraft
    movement areas and associated airport features, and are useful when performing ground
    surveys. Over 1,000 airports have been flown and photographs for these locations
    are currently available through the NGS photo library.",nt"license_title":
