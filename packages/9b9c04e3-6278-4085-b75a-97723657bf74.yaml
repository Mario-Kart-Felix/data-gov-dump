  a custom built battery prognostics testbed at the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of
  Excellence (PCoE). Li-ion batteries were run through 3 different operational profiles
  (charge, discharge and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) at different temperatures.
  Discharges were carried out at different current load levels until the battery voltage
  fell to preset voltage thresholds. Some of these thresholds were lower than that
  recommended by the OEM (2.7 V) in order to induce deep discharge aging effects.
  Repeated charge and discharge cycles result in accelerated aging of the batteries.
  The experiments were stopped when the batteries reached the end-of-life (EOL) criteria
  of 30% fade in rated capacity (from 2 Ah to 1.4 Ah).rnrn rnrn**Data Acquisition:**rnrn

  Estimated charge transfer resistance (Ohms) rnrn**Intended Use:**rnrnThe data sets
  can serve for a variety of purposes. Because these are essentially a large number
  of Run-to-Failure time series, the data can be set for development of prognostic
  algorithms. In particular, due to the differences in depth-of-discharge (DOD), the
  duration of rest periods and intrinsic variability, no two cells have the same state-of-life
  (SOL) at the same cycle index. The aim is to be able to manage this uncertainty,
  which is representative of actual usage, and make reliable predictions of Remaining
  Useful Life (RUL) in both the End-of-Discharge (EOD) and End-of-Life (EOL) contexts.

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
