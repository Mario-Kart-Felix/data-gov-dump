    with 10x10 meter cell size representing the rugosity of several deep coral priority
    areas off the South Atlantic Bight, derived from data collected in September 2009.
    NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy
    Foster, as well as federal, university, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam
    bathymetry data off the South Atlantic Bight from 9/3/09 to 9/7/09. Data was acquired
    with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz). It
    was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Attitude and sound
    velocity correctors applied to the data. Verified tides were not applied to the
    data, leaving the depth values referenced to the ellipsoid. The imagery is projected
    in the UTM Zone 17 north, NAD83 datum. The processed CARIS data was used to generate
    a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. The CARIS Export option "BASE Surface
    to Image" was then used to create a GeoTiff of the priority areas. Rugosity was
    derived from this surface using NOAA's Benthic Terrain Modeler extension.",nt"owner_org":
