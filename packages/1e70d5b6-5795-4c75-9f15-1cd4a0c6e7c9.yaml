    of white-tailed deer (WT) and mule deer (MD) on and adjacent to Fort Niobrara National
    Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in north-central Nebraska 2007-2009 relative to the potential
    risk of chronic wasting disease (CWD) transmission to refuge cervid populations,
    including elk confined by big game fence. A total of 26 WT and 7 MD were captured
    on the refuge; 13 adult female deer (9 WT; 4 MD) were fitted with GPS radio collars
    and the remaining deer were marked with numbered ear tags. Electronic records from
    10 collared deer were used to estimate 95% home ranges and 50% core areas using
    the fixed kernel method and to evaluate daily movements. We used recovery information
    from ear-tagged bucks to document long distance movements by males. Home range analyses
    suggest eight deer (5 WT, 3 MD) had overlapping summer and winter home ranges, one
    WT was a seasonal migrant, and one MDu2019s migration status was not determined.
    The average annual home range size for resident female WT on Fort Niobrara was 6.23
    square miles which was more than 9 times larger than reported for DeSoto NWR in
    eastern Nebraska and approximately 30% smaller than for Crescent Lake NWR in western
    Nebraska. The average annual home range size for resident female MD on Fort Niobrara
    was 5.28 square miles, smaller than reported at Crescent Lake NWR. Average daily
    movement distance for female deer on Fort Niobrara (.30 miles, WT and MD) was greater
    than reported for female deer in eastern Nebraska (WT only) but similar to western
    Nebraska results (WT and MD). Core areas for both resident MD and WT on Fort Niobrara
    averaged 1.22 square miles and all but one deer had core area overlap with other
    collared deer. All deer had home ranges that included potential deer concentration
    areas off refuge and six deer had short-term movements outside of established home
    ranges. Collared deer moved freely through various fence types with the exception
    of big game fence, across which deer movements were greatly reduced. Although most
    of the female deer in this study had home ranges extending only 1-3 miles off the
    refuge, recovery information for ear-tagged bucks suggest some males make longer
    distance movements with 25-40 mile distances documented. The risk of CWD transmission
    to refuge cervid populations is present; however, refuge management practices should
    minimize this risk until all elk are managed as a free-ranging population at Fort
    Niobrara NWR.",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras":
