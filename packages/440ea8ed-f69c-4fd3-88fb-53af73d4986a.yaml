  pre/post performance evaluation (PE) is to identify progress (in phase 1) and achievement
  (in phase 2) of short-term and long-term outcomes of PLUP, focusing on PMAP 1. A
  secondary purpose is to assess the implementation performance of PLUP in order to
  inform future PMAP roll-out in other areas. Phase 1 data collection occurred from
  August - October 2016, and Phase 2 will be conducted in 2018 to serve as an endline
  for PMAP 1 outcomes. The phasing of data collection activities is intended to both
  identify immediate lessons learned in PMAP 1 implementation as well as capture changes
  in PMAP 1 outcomes over an extended period of time, accounting for long-term effects
  not readily materialized by the time project activities have concluded.nnThe report
  addresses five key evaluation questions, as listed below. In particular, the report
  focuses heavily on presenting information to address Evaluation Question 1, as it
  relates to both project outputs and nine project outcomes (or progress against targeted
  project achievements). n1.tHow has PLUP progressed in the achievement of short-term
  outcomes, and how is it likely to progress in the achievement of long-term outcomes?
  n2.tWere achievements toward identified PLUP outcomes varied by geography, community
  type, or gender and vulnerable/marginalized groups?n3.tWhat were the main challenges
  in managing PLUP?n4.tWhat were unintended results (positive or negative) achieved
  on PLUP?n5.tThrough what pathways, if any, is increased spatial certainty likely
  to increase household incomes? What evidence does the evaluation find for this?nnIn
  relation to Evaluation Question 1, while many PMAP 1 activities have been completed,
  key outputs - particularly village maps and the district Information Management
  System (IMS) - have yet to be delivered to actual users in partner areas. Specifically
  regarding Task 1 maps, there are indications of proposed use of maps at the village
  level, but the extent of the resource mapping and use of these maps for spatial
  planning varied across sampled villages. The focus of PMAP 1, Task 1 at the village
  level is largely geared towards establishing agreement of village boundaries. Task
  1 is also especially relevant in terms of conflict. There is evidence that the project
  helped address administrative disputes through their use of a participatory and
  technology-based approach to VBS/RM, and made important contributions in setting
  up dispute resolution mechanisms in high conflict-prone areas. In some instances,
  however, the project re-opened existing disagreements that had been ignored or were
  dormant. Each sub-district the ET visited had one (or more) disputes remaining after
  the completion of the VBS/RM process.nnTurning to Task 2 - 4 progress at the time
  of the evaluation, some geospatial and licensing data had been compiled; Geographic
  Information System (GIS) and IMS trainings had been completed in all districts;
  and a geographically specific IMS had been developed. Additional outputs including
  the complete database, and those related to the IMS had not been realized (including
  installation of the IMS, hardware, and internet connection). Users of the IMS were
  enthusiastic about the tools; however, there remain significant threats to use after
  delivery of this output. When the ET was conducting fieldwork, there was no plan
  for i) coordination of spatial planning; ii) installation and establishment of the
  IMS; and iii) management and maintenance of the IMS. The lack of an exit strategy
  for PMAP 1 also raised questions about sustainability and continued use of all task
  outputs that had clearly generated much interest among local stakeholders. nIn terms
  of the nine PLUP outcomes, the most measurable change for short-term outcomes (Outcomes
  1 - 6) was identified at the village level. For example, Outcome 1 is increased
  public perception of spatial certainty. The evaluation found evidence of this in
  sampled PMAP 1 villages from pre-PMAP 1 activities, as measured through awareness
  and understanding of village boundaries. Progress at the district and national level
  across short-term outcomes, however, was less prominent. nnWhile some progress was
  identified in long-term outcomes (Outcomes 7 - 9), the majority of information presented
  in the report for these outcomes is baseline information to be used as a point of
  comparison in Phase 2 of the PE. nnEvaluation Question 2 presents data that explains
  how project progress against outputs did not, in general, vary by characteristics
  including geography, implementer, phase of implementation, gender, or marginalized/vulnerable
  groups. Outcomes baselines, however, do vary substantially by district; each district
  has a unique context that will be important to re-evaluate in 2018 in terms of confidence
  in administration, capacity, and licensing and permitting. Furthermore, in Evaluation
  Question 4, the ET identified unintended results of PMAP 1. Respondents noted more
  positive than negative unintended results, with one important positive result being
  indications of replication of the VBS/RM process in Mamasa and Mamuju districts,
  in West Sulawesi Province.nnWithin this context of project progress, in Evaluation
  Question 3, the ET explores the management structure and challenges faced during
  PMAP 1 implementation. The most commonly mentioned barriers had to do with PMAP
  1 resources and unclear expectations. The contractor was found to be resourceful
  in addressing these barriers; however, MCA-I and MCC were critical of the performance
  of the implementer, and reported that the implementer under-delivered on some basic
  output requirements like the delivery of the VBS/RM process as specified in the
  Contract.nnLastly, in regards to Evaluation Question 5, though GP has missed an
  opportunity to demonstrate that increased spatial certainty leads to greener investments
  in partner districts because of the adjusted sequencing of PLUP and the GP Facility
  Investments, the evaluation found plausible pathways through which spatial certainty
  as advocated for through PLUP can contribute to GP's goals. Findings indicate that
  the objectives that PMAP 1 is seeking to achieve remain relevant, particularly in
  the context of governance, development planning, and safeguards in Indonesia. It
  is not surprising that implementation has drawn interest from international institutions
  like the World Bank, and from key government reform projects like the Peat Restoration
  Agency (BRG).n      \",\n\t\"license_title\": \"License Not Specified\",\n\t\"extras\":
