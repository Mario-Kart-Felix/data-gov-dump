    Slough proposed Buena Vista addition. Content includes information of the National
    Wildlife Refuge System, refuge administration, key areas of management focus, rights-of-way
    and easements, law enforcement, facilities development and management, fire management,
    and interagency and public coordination. The 289-acre Buena Vista Property consists
    of three parcels; one consisting of approximately 187 acres, one consisting of approximately
    100 acres, and another consisting of approximately 2 acres, currently owned by California
    Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). However, CDFG has indicated that they have limited
    resources to manage Buena Vista. Therefore, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service)
    proposes to accept donation of the 100-acre and 2 acre parcels from CDFG in fee
    title and to cooperatively manage the entire 289-acre property as a unit of the
    Ellicott Slough National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) and State Ecological Reserve (See
    Figure 1). CDFG would retain ownership of the 187-acre parcel and would enter into
    a Memorandum of Understanding with the Service for management of the Buena Vista
    property. This is similar to the current management arrangement at the Refuge where
    the Service manages the entire area, including a 30-acre parcel owned by CDFG. This
    Conceptual Management Plan (CMP) is for the Serviceu2019s proposed acquisition and
    management of the Buena Vista Unit of the Refuge and presents a general outline
    on how Buena Vista would be managed. As a conceptual plan, this CMP does not provide
    extensive detail or pinpoint exactly where long-term habitat improvements could
    be made or exactly where public use facilities would be ultimately constructed.
    Those details would be included in the Refugeu2019s Comprehensive Conservation Plan
    (CCP), a long-term formal planning effort scheduled to begin in 2005 for the Refuge.
    During the CCP planning effort, goals, objectives, and strategies for public use
    as well as resource management will be developed, with input from the public and
    in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. This CMP, however, presents
    a broad overview of the Service's proposed management approaches to wildlife, habitats,
    public uses, wildlife-dependent recreational activities, wildfire suppression, rights-of-way,
    easements, law enforcement, and facilities. More specific information is included
    for activities proposed during the interim period, prior to implementation of an
    approved CCP. As part of the acquisition process, an Environmental Assessment, Land
    Protection Plan, compatibility determinations, and a Section 7 endangered species
    consultation, have been prepared by the Service to analyze the environmental effects
    of establishing and managing the proposed Buena Vista Addition as part of the Refuge.
    The purpose of the proposed Buena Vista addition is to enhance survival prospects
    of endangered species in the area. This expansion is being proposed primarily to
    protect the endangered Santa Cruz long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum
    croceum). The Buena Vista property is extremely important to the survival of the
    Santa Cruz long-toed salamander (SCLTS) because of the small number of active breeding
    populations (11 known), and the limited amount of suitable habitat. In addition,
    acquisition and management of this site would benefit other rare species including
    the endangered robust spineflower (Chorizanthe robusta var. robusta) and the threatened
    California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense). Buena Vista supports one
    of only six known populations of the robust spineflower, and 135 acres of the property
    are included in the designated critical habitat (50 CFR 17 36822-36845). Other rare
    plants on the site include Hookeru2019s manzanita (Arctostaphylos hookeri ssp. hookeri)
    (CNPS 1B), Kelloggu2019s horkelia (Horkelia cuneata ssp. sericea) (CNPS 1B), and
    California bottlebrush grass (Elymus californicus) (CNPS 4).",nt"owner_org":
