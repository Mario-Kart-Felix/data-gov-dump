  categories (High, Moderate, Low, and Non-Habitat) derived from a composite, continuous
  surface of sage-grouse habitat suitability index (HSI) values for Nevada and northeastern
  California during summeru00c2u00b8 which is a surrogate for habitat conditions during
  the sage-grouse brood-rearing period. Summary of steps to create Habitat Categories:
  HABITAT SUITABILITY INDEX: The HSI was derived from a generalized linear mixed model
  (specified by binomial distribution and created using ArcGIS 10.2.2) that contrasted
  data from multiple environmental factors at used sites (telemetry locations) and
  available sites (random locations). Predictor variables for the model represented
  vegetation communities at multiple spatial scales, water resources, habitat configuration,
  urbanization, roads, elevation, ruggedness, and slope. Vegetation data was derived
  from various mapping products, which included NV SynthMap (Petersen 2008, SageStitch
  (Comer et al. 2002, LANDFIRE (Landfire 2010), and the CA Fire and Resource Assessment
  Program (CFRAP 2006). The analysis was updated to include high resolution percent
  cover within 30 x 30 m pixels for Sagebrush, non-sagebrush, herbaceous vegetation,
  and bare ground (C. Homer, unpublished; based on the methods of Homer et al. 2014,
  Xian et al. 2015 ) and conifer (primarily pinyon-juniper, P. Coates, unpublished).
  The pool of telemetry data included the same data from 1998 - 2013 used by Coates
  et al. (2014); additional telemetry location data from field sites in 2014 were
  added to the dataset. The dataset was then split according calendar date into three
  seasons (spring, summer, winter). Summer included telemetry locations (n = 11,743)
  from July to mid-October. All age and sex classes of marked grouse were used in
  the analysis. Sufficient data (i.e., a minimum of 100 locations from at least 20
  marked Sage-grouse) for modeling existed in 10 subregions for spring and summer,
  and seven subregions in winter, using all age and sex classes of marked grouse.
  It is important to note that although this map is composed of HSI values derived
  from the seasonal data, it does not explicitly represent habitat suitability for
  reproductive females (i.e., nesting and with broods). Insufficient data were available
  to allow for estimation of this habitat type for all seasons throughout the study
  area extent. A Resource Selection Function (RSF) was calculated for each subregion
  using R software (v 3.13) and using generalized linear models to derive model-averaged
  parameter estimates for each covariate across a set of additive models. Subregional
  RSFs were transformed into Habitat Suitability Indices, and averaged together to
  produce an overall statewide HSI whereby a relative probability of occurrence was
  calculated for each raster cell during the summer season. In order to account for
  discrepancies in HSI values caused by varying ecoregions within Nevada, the HSI
  was divided into north and south extents using a slightly modified flood region
  boundary (Mason 1999) that was designed to represent respective mesic and xeric
  regions of the state. North and south HSI rasters were each relativized according
  to their maximum value to rescale between zero and one, then mosaicked once more
  into a state-wide extent. HABITAT CATEGORIZATION: Using the same ecoregion boundaries
  described above, the habitat classification dataset (an independent data set comprising
  10% of the total telemetry location sample) was split into locations falling within
  respective north and south regions. HSI values from the composite and relativized
  statewide HSI surface were then extracted to each classification dataset location
  within the north and south region. The distribution of these values were used to
  identify class break values corresponding to 0.5 (high), 1.0 (moderate), and 1.5
  (low) standard deviations (SD) from the mean HSI. These class breaks were used to
  classify the HSI surface into four discrete categories of habitat suitability: High,
  Moderate, Low, and Non-Habitat. In terms of percentiles, High habitat comprised
  greater than 30.9 % of the HSI values, Moderate comprised 15 u00e2u0080u0093 30.9%,
  Low comprised 6.7 u00e2u0080u0093 15%, and Non-Habitat comprised less than 6.7%.The
  classified north and south regions were then clipped by the boundary layer and mosaicked
  to create a statewide categorical surface for habitat selection. Each habitat suitability
  category was converted to a vector output where gaps within polygons less than 1.2
  million square meters were eliminated, polygons within 500 meters of each other
  were connected to create corridors and polygons less than 1.2 million square meters
  in one category were incorporated to the adjacent category. The final step was to
  mask major roads that were buffered by 50m (Census, 2014), lakes (Peterson, 2008)
  and urban areas, and place those masked areas into the non-habitat category. The
  existing urban layer (Census 2010) was not sufficient for our needs because it excluded
  towns with a population lower than 1,500. Hence, we masked smaller towns (populations
  of 100 to 1500) and development with Census Block polygons (Census 2015) that had
  at least 50% urban development within their boundaries when viewed with reference
  imagery (ArcGIS World Imagery Service Layer). REFERENCES: California Forest and
