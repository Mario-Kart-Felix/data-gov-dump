    The bathymetry and shaded-relief maps of Offshore Pacifica, California, were generated
    from bathymetry data collected by Fugro Pelagos, and by California State University,
    Monterey Bay (CSUMB). Mapping was completed between 2005 and 2007, using a combination
    of 400-kHz Reson 7125 and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounders. These mapping
    missions combined to collect bathymetry from about the 10-m isobath to beyond the
    3-nautical-mile limit of Californiau0092s State Waters.",nt"license_title":
