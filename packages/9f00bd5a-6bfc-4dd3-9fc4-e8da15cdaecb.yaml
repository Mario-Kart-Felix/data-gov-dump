    of all historic properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places is
    of interest to Federal agencies, the National Park Service, State Historic and Tribal
    Historic Preservation Offices, local government and certified local governments,
    consultants, academia, and the interested public. This interest stems from the regulatory
    processes of managing cultural resources that are consistent with the National Historic
    Preservation Act as Amended (NHPA), the National Environmental Policy Act as Amended,
    the Archaeological Resources Protection Act, and other laws related to cultural
    resources. The regulations promulgating these laws require the use of spatial data
    in support of various decisions and actions related to cultural resource management.The
    information contained in the feature attribute tables for this dataset is not descriptive.
    Rather the tables document how the data was created, where it came from, who created
    the data, what map parameters were used e.g. source scale, source accuracy, source
    coordinate system etc. Also included is information on the name of the resource,
    status of the resource i.e. does it still exist, is it restricted and what if any
    constraints are associated with the resource. Please note that each historic property
    listed on the National Register has its own nominating history and therefore location
    information collected in the nominating process is different from one property to
    another. Therefore metadata has been created for each listed historic property to
    inform the potential user of the history or lineage of the spatial information associated
    with the historic property. Locations associated with restricted National Register
    of Historic Places properties are not included in this GeoDatabase and must be requested
    from the National Park Service, National Register Program.The metadata in the feature
    attribute table are compliant with the National Park Serviceu00e2u0080u0099s Cultural
    Resource Spatial Data Transfer Standards. These standards were created to facilitate
    the exchange of spatial data within a variety of contexts, particularly Sections
    106 and 110 of NHPA as well as in the context of disaster recovery events. Often
    locations of National Register listed properties are needed in these situations.
    The National Register Geo-spatial dataset is organized as a geo-database with feature
    class definitions based on the National Registeru00e2u0080u0099s Resource Type designations
    i.e. historic buildings, historic districts, historic structures, historic objects,
    and historic sites. The definitions of these types can be found in National Register
    Bulletin 16A and in the metadata statements for each feature class.",nt"license_title":

    more than 10 acres are delineated as polygons. All points and polygons are generated
    from coordinate pairs submitted with each individual National Register nomination.
    At this time, the quality and accuracy of the data is variable. Generally, listed
    historic properties represented as points (locations) are accurate to being placed
    in the appropriate county. Listed historic properties represented as polygons are
    far more problematic. Transcription errors and incorrect sequencing of bounding
    coordinates permeate this part of the dataset. Potential users are advised to carefully
    review the quality of the location and boundary of listed historic properties of
    interest to them before using this data. Subsequent releases of this dataset will
