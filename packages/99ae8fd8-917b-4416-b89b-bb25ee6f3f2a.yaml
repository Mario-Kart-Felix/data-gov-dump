    files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information
    from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
    Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents a seamless
    national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile
    is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to
    cover the entire nation.  The Address Ranges Relationship File (ADDR.dbf) contains
    the attributes of each address range.  Each address range applies to a single edge
    and has a unique address range identifier (ARID) value.  The edge to which an address
    range applies can be determined by linking the address range to the All Lines Shapefile
    (EDGES.shp) using the permanent topological edge identifier (TLID) attribute.  Multiple
    address ranges can apply to the same edge since an edge can have multiple address
    ranges.  Note that the most inclusive address range associated with each side of
    a street edge already appears in the All Lines Shapefile (EDGES.shp).  The TIGER/Line
    Shapefiles contain potential address ranges, not individual addresses.  The term
    "address range" refers to the collection of all possible structure numbers from
    the first structure number to the last structure number and all numbers of a specified
    parity in between along an edge side relative to the direction in which the edge
    is coded.  The address ranges in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles are potential ranges
    that include the full range of possible structure numbers even though the actual
    structures may not exist.",nt"license_title": "Creative Commons Attribution",nt"extras":
