    the start, MISTI compiled a baseline stabilization and impact evaluation and survey.
    For the five waves of surveys, each of which was conducted over several months,
    a total of 190,264 individual interviews were undertaken in 5,093 different villages

    easy access for international development practitioners, researchers and other interested
    parties in accordance with the USAIDu2019s Open Data Policy. As part of this process,
    village names and locations have been replaced with unique village identifiers to
    ensure the safety of Afghan stakeholders. This preserves a researcher's ability

    dataset contains five semi-annual iterations or u201cwavesu201d of surveys conducted
    by Management Systems International (MSI) from September 2012 through November 2014
    to assess the impact of USAID projects on stability and resilience at the district
    and village levels in Afghanistan.  The main objective of the stabilization projects
    covered by the surveys, including the Stability in Key Areas (SIKA) programs, the
    Community Cohesion Initiative (CCI), the Afghan Civilian Assistance Program II,
    and the Kandahar Food Zone (KFZ), was to promote good governance and stability by
    building connections between government leaders and local communities.  USAIDu2019s
    efforts in these projects included training local government officials on how to
    manage projects, producing manuals that informed the public on how to tap into government
    services, and providing support for small-scale public works projects.  MISTI data
    analysis included village demographic characteristics, violent incident counts,
    stabilization and the National Solidarity Programme (NSP) project activities.  Perception
    indicators from interviews of 190,264 people conducted in 5,093 villages across
    130 districts and 23 provinces in Afghanistan, has already yielded important insights
    that will inform U.S. and Afghan Government policy and practice related to transition.
