  files (.dbf) are an extract of selectedn          geographic and cartographic information
  from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
  Encoding and Referencingn          (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents
  a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line
  shapefile isn          designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they
  can be combined to cover the entire nation.n          n          The primary legal
  divisions of most states are termed counties.  In Louisiana, these divisions are
  known as parishes.  In Alaska, which has no counties,n          the equivalent entities
  are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized
  area, census areas.  The latter are delineatedn          cooperatively for statistical
  purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.  In four states (Maryland,
  Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are onen          or more incorporated places
  that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions
  of their states.  These incorporated placesn          are known as independent cities
  and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation.  The District
  of Columbia and Guam have no primaryn          divisions, and each area is considered
  an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation.  The Census Bureau treats
  the following entities as equivalentsn          of counties for purposes of data
  presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa,
  Municipalities in the Commonwealth of then          Northern Mariana Islands, and
  Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The entire area of the United States, Puerto
  Rico, and the Island Areas is covered byn          counties or equivalent entities.n
  \         n          The boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are as
  of January 1of the shapefile release year, primarily as reported through the Census
  Bureau'sn          Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).\",\n\t\"license_title\":
