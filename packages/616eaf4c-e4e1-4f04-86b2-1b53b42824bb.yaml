    fish communities in Pearl Harbor, Oahu, Hawaii were surveyed between January and
    October, 1996. Samples were taken and observations were made at fifteen stations
    throughout the harbor, in a variety of environments ranging from near oceanic conditions
    at the harbor entrance channel to areas receiving land runoff with high sediment
    loads and turbidity. All organisms were identified to species or the highest practicable
    taxonomic level, and results were compared to previous published and unpublished
    marine biological surveys conducted in the harbor, published taxonomic descriptions
    of organisms collected from the harbor and Pearl Harbor specimens cataloged in the
    Bernice P. Bishop Museum collections. All data were entered on a relational database
    at the Bishop Museum (database is not included in this dataset) which enables tracking
    the appearance of individual species with time. Based on a number of criteria, nonindigenous
    and cryptogenic (i. e. origin unsure, but with good evidence of being introduced)
    species were designated and their introductions noted on a timeline beginning from
    the first organisms reported in Pearl Harbor in the last century. This study collected
    or observed a total of 434 species or higher taxa (36 algae, 1 spermatophyte, 338
    invertebrate and 59 fish) from the 15 stations sampled, the highest number of taxa
    that have been collected for any Pearl Harbor study. Ninety six species, or about
    22%, are considered to be introduced or cryptogenic. The areas of highest species
    richness were in the entrance channel and in Rainbow Bay at the northeast head of
    East Loch where number of taxa were around 150. Lowest species richness occurred
    in the areas of high sedimentation and turbidity at the head of West Loch where
    fewer than 50 taxa occurred. Dendrographs based on Sorensen Indices of Similarity
    of species composition among stations suggest three types of communities in the
    harbor, one associated with relatively oceanic conditions in channel areas, one
    with the highly turbid West Loch sedimentary environment and one with conditions
    prevailing throughout the rest of the harbor. This report also contains historical
    maps, a chronology of important events, and a bibliography of related work.",nt"owner_org":
