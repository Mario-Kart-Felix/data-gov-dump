    and reef fishes of Waikiki and the Kuapa Pond and Maunalua Bay areas of Hawaii Kai
    were conducted with the objective of the presence and impact of nonindigenous (introduced)
    marine organisms. Findings were compared with historical records of species reported
    in these locations and with the results of similar studies conducted in Hawaii and
    the Pacific. Observations and collections were made at 15 stations at Waikiki in
    January 2001 and at five stations in Kuapa Pond-Maunalua Bay in February 2002 at
    5 stations. A comprehensive literature review of published papers and books and
    unpublished reports was conducted to develop listings of previous species reports,
    and the marine invertebrates, fish, mollusk and algae collections at Bishop Museum
    were queried for information regarding all organisms that had been collected from
    these areas. The assembled data were developed into a relational data bases used
    to determine the percent component of the total biota that is nonindigenous or cryptogenic,
    the number of new reports versus the number of previous reports not found, and a
    chronology of first reports of introductions. A total of 925 taxa including 749
    species were observed or collected in Waikiki, and 384 taxa including 317 species
    at Kuapa Pond-Maunalua Bay. Of these 52 species designated introduced or cryptogenic
    (collectively termed NIS) were identified at Waikiki, for an NIS component of 6.9%
    of the total species identified for the 15 stations. By comparison 58 NIS were observed
    or collected at Kuapa Pond-Maunalua Bay amounting to an NIS component of total species
    of 18%. Forty-six of the 52 NIS were new reports for Waikiki, and 56 of the 58 NIS
    new for Kuapa Pond- Maunalua Bay sites. However, all but three species, hydroids
    collected from Waikiki designated cryptogenic, were previously reported elsewhere
    in Hawaii, with first reports mostly in Pearl Harbor, Honolulu Harbor or Kaneohe
    Bay. The high incidence of first reports for Waikiki and the Hawaii Kai area in
    this study are clearly effort related, since these were the first comprehensive
    sampling efforts that have been conducted at these locations. This dataset includes
    the complete report from this study in PDF format and output from the relational
    database as spreadsheet files.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
