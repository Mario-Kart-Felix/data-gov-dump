    conducted along 2 consecutively placed 25-m transects, as part of Rapid Ecological
    Assessments conducted at 9 sites at Maro Reef in the NW Hawaiian Islands during
    1 September - 4 October 2006, aboard the NOAA Hi'ialakai Reef Assessment and Monitoring
    Program (RAMP) Cruise HI0611. Within an area of 1-3m on each side of both transect
    lines, each colony was inspected and every diseased/afflicted coral enumerated and
    identified to the lowest taxonomic level. For each affected coral the following
    information was recorded: colony size, type of affliction, area affected, percent
    live/dead, and severity of the affliction (mild = 1-10%, moderate = 11-25%, marked
    = 26-50%, severe = 51-75%, acute = 76-100%). Coral afflictions were classified into
    one of six general categories (following Willis et al., 2004) including: bleaching,
    tissue loss, black band disease, skeletal growth anomaly, predation, and other lesions.
    This latter category included algal overgrowth, as well as unidentified syndromes
    causing deterioration of scleractinian corals. Tissue samples of selected cases
    were procured for histopathological analyses. These data provide the basis for computing
    quantitative estimates of disease incidence and prevalence. Samples and photographs
    provide aid in further disease characterization and description. Histological tissue
    samples are traditionally fixed in a formaldehyde solution prior to preparation
    for processing and analysis.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
