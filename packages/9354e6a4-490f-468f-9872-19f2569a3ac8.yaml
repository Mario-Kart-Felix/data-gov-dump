    of 17 classes of land cover based on the International Geosphere-Biosphere DISCover
    land cover legend (Loveland and Belward 1997) and the 15 classes of the SiB model
    processed at the USGS EROS Data Center (EDC). Specifically, the resampled DISCover
    datasets were derived from the 1km DISCover data set compiled by the USGS. The 1km
    data sets for each classification scheme were aggregated to 1, 0.5 and 0.25 degree
    spatial resolutions for this ISLSCP II data collection. Each layer of the aggregated
    products corresponds to a single DISCover land cover category and the values represent
    the percentage of the coarse resolution cell (1 degree, etc...)occupied by that
    land cover category. The dominant class data show the land cover category that occupies
    the majority of the cell and is derived from the percentage files for each cover
    type. The objective of this study was to create a land cover map derived from 1
    kilometer AVHRR data using a full year of data (April 1992-March 1993). This thematic
    map was resampled to 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree grids for the International Satellite
    Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) data initiative II. During this re-processing,
    the original EDC land cover type and fraction maps were adjusted to match the water/land
    fraction of the ISLSCP II land/water mask. These maps were generated for use by
    global modelers and others. This data set is one of the products of the International
    Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project, Initiative II (ISLSCP II) data collection
    which contains 50 global time series data sets for the ten-year period 1986 to 1995.
    Selected data sets span even longer periods. ISLSCP II is a consistent collection
    of data sets that were compiled from existing data sources and algorithms, and were
    designed to satisfy the needs of modelers and investigators of the global carbon,
    water and energy cycle. The data were acquired from a number of U.S. and international
    agencies, universities, and institutions. The global data sets were mapped at consistent
    spatial (1, 0.5 and 0.25 degrees) and temporal (monthly, with meteorological data
    at finer (e.g., 3-hour)) resolutions and reformatted into a common ASCII format.
    The data and documentation have undergone two peer reviews.ISLSCP is one of several
    projects of Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) [http://www.gewex.org/]
    and has the lead role in addressing land-atmosphere interactions -- process modeling,
    data retrieval algorithms, field experiment design and execution, and the development
    of global data sets.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
