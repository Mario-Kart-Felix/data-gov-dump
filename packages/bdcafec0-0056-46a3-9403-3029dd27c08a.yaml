    a network of lands and waters managed specifically for the protection of wildlife
    and wildlife habitat. Refuges are also places where compatible human contact with
    nature is encouraged. In keeping with this national direction, Parker River National
    Wildlife Refuge has served both wildlife and people since its establishment in 1942.
    In its coastal barrier island-salt marsh location along major bird migration routes,
    the refuge is used by over 300 species of birds. Parker River's extensive salt marshes
    serve as important feeding and resting areas for peak concentrations of up to 25,000
    ducks and 6,000 geese during fall and spring migrations. In addition, the refuge
    provides habitat for large flocks of warblers and shorebirds, and refuge wetlands
    are valued as a nursery for fish and shellfish. Over 400,000 people visit Parker
    River NWR each year. The natural beauty of unspoiled beach and dune, expansive salt
    marsh, and sparkling water offers visitors respite from the bustle of surrounding
    urbanization including the developed northern end of Plum Island. The combination
    of natural and man-altered habitat u2014 salt marsh, saltpans, brush, freshwater
    pools, and fields u2014 makes the refuge an outstanding area for wildlife observation.
    In addition to bird watching and environmental education, visitor activities include
    surf fishing, hiking, clamming, plum and cranberry picking, and hunting. In view
    of its two-fold mission, Parker Riveru2019s central management challenge is to protect
    its wildlife and natural character while providing an increasing number of visitors
    with quality recreational, educational, and interpretive experiences. In 1980 a
    nine-step comprehensive planning process and extensive public involvement effort
    to document long-range management and development goals for Parker River was initiated.
    The planning process was accomplished through the cooperation of a Fish and Wildlife
    Service team of refuge planners, wildlife managers, landscape architects, biologists,
    resource specialists, computer mapping specialists, and cartographers. The resulting
    Technical Report describes management measures necessary to retain the natural,
    wildlife, and human values associated with the refuge. Specifically, this report
    includes: (1). Background information about the refuge, its management, and the
    planning process. (2). A summary statement of policy direction and planning issues.
    (3). Long-range objectives u2014 both quantitative and qualitative u2014 derived
    from policy guidance, resource capabilities, and use demands.(4) A master plan map
    based on these objectives that shows functional and spatial relationships between
    present and potential refuge uses. (5) A phasing strategy and map for achieving
    the objectives over the next ten to twenty years. (6). A set of Construction Project
    Worksheets that give a detailed accounting for the major projects required to achieve
    the objectives. These worksheets serve as a bridge between concept and action.",nt"license_title":
