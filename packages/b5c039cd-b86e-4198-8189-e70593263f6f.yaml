  for the Lake Champlain Basin, Vermont and New York. Two impervious classes were
  mapped: (1) RoadsRailroads; and (2) Other Impervious. The latter category included
  parking lots, driveways, sidewalks, and buildings. Pertinent imagery could not be
  obtained for the Quebec portion of the Lake Champlain Basin, which was thus excluded
  from the final product. The primary source used to derive this impervious surfaces
  layer was 1-meter resolution National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data acquired
  in 2011. The NAIP datasets covering the study area were 4-band aerial imagery, meaning
  that they contained a Near Infrared band in addition to the visible bands (i.e.,
  Red, Green, Blue). This band improved the utility of the imagery, permitting use
  of vegetation indices that rely on the Near Infrared and Red bands (e.g., Normalized
  Difference Vegetation Index). Ancillary data sources included various thematic vector
  GIS datasets, including the Lake Champlain Basin watershed boundary, lakes, stream
  centerlines, road centerlines, railroad centerlines, and building points. This impervious
  surfaces dataset is considered current as of 2011. Object-based image analysis techniques
  (OBIA) were used to extract impervious surfaces using the best available remotely-sensed
  and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects
  based on their spectral and spatial properties while taking into account boundaries
  imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment, a rule-based expert
  system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by
  incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern,
  location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological
  procedures were used to ensure that the end product was both accurate and cartographically
  coherent. It is important to note that the mapping protocol described above was
  a \"top-down\" approach: impervious surfaces were mapped when they were visible
  in the available aerial imagery. In practical terms, impervious surfaces were not
  captured by the mapping process when they were obscured by tree canopy. Although
  this modeling limitation means that the total area of extant impervious surfaces
  would be underestimated in subsequent analyses, it also provides a better estimate
  of surfaces whose environmental effects are not mitigated by overhanging vegetation.
  Indeed, one of the well-known benefits of trees is that they absorb or slow rainwater
  before it hits the ground, so the top-down approach is a reasonable and effective
  method for mapping the impervious surfaces that most affect stormwater runoff volume.
  The draft impervious maps produced by automated feature extraction were extensively
  reviewed for accuracy, coherence, and aesthetic quality, and errors of omission
  and commission were fixed as necessary. Accuracy assessments were then conducted
  separately for the two sides of the Basin, indicating an overall accuracy of 99%
  for Vermont and 99% for New York. The overall accuracy for the combined area was
  also 99%. The user's accuracies for Roads/Railroads, Other Impervious, and Not Impervious
  were 98%, 98%, and 100% respectively.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\":
