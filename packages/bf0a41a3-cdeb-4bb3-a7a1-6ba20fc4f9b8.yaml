  some of the considerations that need to be made when designing algorithms for a
  vehicle health management application. The choices made here affect the quality
  of the diagnosis and prognosis (covered in Chapter 7). Therefore, the algorithmic
  design choices are made in conjunction with the design choices for diagnostics and
  prognostics to optimally support these tasks. Furthermore, additional considerations
  imposed by computational constraints, resource availability, algorithm maintenance,
  need for algorithm re-tuning, etc. will impact the solutions.rnIt should also be
  noted that technological advances, both in hardware and software, impose the need
  for new solutions. For example, as new materials and new sensors are being developed,
  the algorithmic solutions will need to follow suit.rnIn general, there seems to
  be a trend to have more sensor data available. While this is potentially a good
  thing, sensor data provides value only when it is being processed and interpreted
  properly, in part by the techniques described here. Testing of the methods, however,
  requires the u201crightu201d kind of data. Generally, there is a lack of seeded
  fault data which are required to train and validate algorithms. It is also important
  to migrate information from the component to the subsystem to the system levels
  so that health management technologies can be applied effectively and efficiently
  at the vehicle level. It may be required to perform elements described in this chapter
  between different levels of the vehicle architecture.\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S.

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
