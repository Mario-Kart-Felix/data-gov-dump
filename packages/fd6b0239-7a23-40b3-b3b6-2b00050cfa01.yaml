    Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, from 15 April - 7 May 2009, belt transect surveys of coral population
    and diseases quantitative assessments were conducted, as a part of Rapid Ecological
    Assessments (REA), during the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP)
    Cruise HI0903 in the Marianas Archipelago at biennial intervals by the Coral Reef
    Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC).
    During the cruise, there were 14 surveys in total conducted at REA sites around
    Agrihan Island in the Marianas Archipelago. At the specific REA sites, coral biologists
    along with fish biologists, algal biologists and marine invertebrate zoologist entered
    the water and conducted a fine-scale (~300 m2) and high degree of taxonomic resolution
    REA survey to assess and monitor species composition, abundance, percent cover,
    size distribution, diversity, and general health of fish, corals, macro-invertebrates,
    and algae in shallow-water (< 35 m) habitats. As a part of REA surveys, the coral
    belt surveys were focused on quantifying the diversity, abundance, density, and
    size-class distribution of the anthozoan and hydrozoan corals as well as the condition
    and health state of the coral reef populations. The surveys were conducted along
    two consecutively-placed, 25m transect lines. The belt width was dictated at the
    beginning of each dive by subjective perceived colony density: 1-m width was used
    in high density areas, while 2-m width was used in low density areas. Within each
    25m transect, five 2.5-meter segments were surveyed (beginning at points: 0, 5,
    10, 15, and 20 meters), whereby in each segment, all coral colonies whose center
    fell within 0.5m of either side of the transect line were identified to the lowest
    taxonomic level possible (genus or species) and two planar size metrics were collected:
    maximum diameter and diameter perpendicular to the maximum diameter. In addition,
    the extent of mortality, both recent and old, was estimated for each colony. Observers
    paid special attention to identifying as best as possible the extent of the former
    live colony. When a coral colony exhibited signs of disease or compromised health,
    additional information was recorded including type of affliction (bleaching, skeletal
    growth anomaly, white syndrome, tissue loss other than white syndrome, trematodiasis,
    necrosis, other, pigmentation responses, algal overgrowth, and predation), severity
    of the affliction (mild, moderate, marked, severe, acute), as well as photographic
    documentation and sometimes tissue samples. Tissue samples were catalogued and fixed
    in buffered zinc-formalin solution for further histopathological analyses. Raw survey
    data included species presence and relative abundance, colony counts per taxon,
    size (width and length), mortality, predation, and health status. A surveyed area
    was ranging from 10m2 to 25m2 per site.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
