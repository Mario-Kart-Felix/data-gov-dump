  true,\n\t\"url\": null,\n\t\"notes\": \"In the Phase I program, Busek Co. Inc. tested
  an existing Hall thruster, the BHT-8000, on iodine propellant.  The thruster was
  fed by a high flow iodine feed system, and supported by an existing Busek hollow
  cathode flowing xenon gas.  The Phase I propellant feed system was evolved from
  a previously demonstrated laboratory feed system.  Throttling of the thruster between
  2 and 11 kW at 200-600V was demonstrated.  Testing has shown that the efficiency
  of iodine fueled BHT-8000 is the same as with xenon, with iodine delivering slightly
  higher thrust to power (T/P).  rnrnPlume current was also measured at a variety
  of operating conditions.  Preliminary design work for a new thruster to be built
  in Phase II was also completed.rn  rnIn Phase II a complete iodine fueled system
  will be developed including the thruster, hollow cathode, and iodine propellant
  feed system.  The nominal power of the Phase II system is 8 kW.  However, it can
  be deeply throttled as well as clustered to much higher power levels.  The technology
  can also be scaled to &gt;100 kW per thruster to support MW-class missions.  The
  target thruster efficiency for the full scale system is 65&#37; at high Isp (~3000
  s) and 60&#37; at high thrust (Isp~2000 s).  These projections are based on Phase
  I testing and prior testing of higher power thrusters.rn  rnIodine enables dramatic
  mass and cost savings for lunar and Mars cargo missions, including Earth escape
  and near-Earth space maneuvers.  High purity iodine is available commercially in
  large quantities at much lower cost than xenon.  Iodine stores at 2 to 3 times greater
  density than xenon and at approximately one thousandth of the pressure and may be
  stored in low mass, low cost propellant tanks instead.  Passive, long term storage
  of a fully fueled system is feasible including storage in conformal tanks which
  may be used to shield internal components against some types of space radiation.\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
