    (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from
    the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
    Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless
    national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File
    is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to
    cover the entire nation. The primary legal divisions of most States are termed counties.
    In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties,
    the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, and municipalities,
    and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively
    for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four States
    (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places
    that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions
    of their States. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are
    treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of
    Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent
    entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following
    entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios
    in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth
    of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire
    area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties
    or equivalent entities. The 2010 Census boundaries for counties and equivalent entities
    are as of January 1, 2010, primarily as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary
    and Annexation Survey (BAS). This table contains housing data derived from the U.S.
    Census 2010 Summary file 1 database for counties. The 2010 Summary File 1 (SF 1)
    contains data compiled from the 2010 Decennial Census questions. This table contains
    data on housing units, owner and rental. This table contains population data derived
    from the U.S. Census 2010 Summary file 1 database for counties. The 2010 Summary
    File 1 (SF 1) contains data compiled from the 2010 Decennial Census questions. This
    table contains data on ancestry, age, and sex.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
