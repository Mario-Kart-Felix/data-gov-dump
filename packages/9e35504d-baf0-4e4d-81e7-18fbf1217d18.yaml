    Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, from 3 September - 1 October 2005, marine invertebrate quantitative
    assessments were conducted, as part of Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA), during
    the Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruise OES 0511 in the Marianas
    Archipelago. Such cruises are conducted at biennial intervals by the Coral Reef
    Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC).
    At specific reef sites, marine invertebrate zoologists along with coral and algal
    biologists entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~100 m2) and high degree
    of taxonomic resolution benthic REA survey for coral, algae, and key invertebrate
    species. Invertebrate surveys were focused on quantifying key non-coral invertebrate
    species common to the reef habitats, and were conducted using a combination of different
    survey techniques to quantify the diverse communities. These methods included belt-transect
    surveys, roving-swim surveys, and quadrat surveys. In belt-transect surveys, quantitative
    counts of key invertebrates were recorded along two consecutively-placed 25m long
    and 2m wide belt transects (total area = 100 m2). For any species that cannot be
    identified in the field, a photograph and a representative specimen, if possible,
    is collected for later identification. Roving-swim surveys were conducted in the
    general area with the goal to collect qualitative data for rare, larger, and cryptic
    organisms, such as Crown of Thorns Starfish and Triton's Trumpet snails which may
    not be seen during belt-transect surveys, and to survey any additional habitats
    present at the site, e.g. sand, sea grass, pavement, etc. This was accomplished
    by swimming a zig-zag pattern that extends roughly 5 m on either side of the two
    transect lines (total length = 500 m). Quadrat surveys were used to quantify the
    smaller, more cryptic invertebrates which were sometimes overlooked or too numerous
    to count during belt-transect surveys. Ten 0.25-m2 quadrats were laid out at 2-m
    intervals along two of the 25-m transects (total area = 5 m2). For each quadrat
    the percent cover of sponges, octocorals and zoanthids was recorded, as well as
    urchins, hermit crabs of the genus Calcinus, trapezid crabs, and coralliophilid
    snails. In addition, up to 25 cm diameters of all urchin species are measured. Based
    on data from previous REA surveys, a group of target invertebrate species was chosen
    for quantitative counts at 2 REA sites at Arakane Bank in the Marianas Archipelago.
    The species in the list were chosen because they have been shown to be common components
    of the reef habitats and they are species that are generally visible (i.e.; non-cryptic)
    and easily enumerated during the course of a single 50-60 minute SCUBA survey.",nt"owner_org":
