    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and, in particular,
    intelligent, autonomous aircraft operating in the National Airspace (NAS) have the
    potential to significantly impact modern society.  They could perform difficult
    and dangerous tasks such as fire fighting, border patrol, and search and rescue,
    and dull tasks such as surveying crops. The elimination of a cockpit and the pilots
    makes UAS operation attractive from an economic standpoint. In addition, much of
    the technology used for autonomy could benefit manned flight as a pilot's aid to
    help in tasks such as landing on an oilrig in the high seas.  Open questions remain,
    however, about how unmanned autonomous aerial vehicles can be safely incorporated
    into the NAS. UAS's operating in the NAS must sense and avoid other vehicles, follow
    air traffic commands, avoid the terrain and land without operator intervention,
    react to contingencies, and be reliable and cost-effective.rnrnThe current approach
    for UAS integration relies on radio links and the operator's acuity to direct them.
    Lost links, however, are unavoidable. UAS's must have the capability to make their
    own decisions based on information available via databases and information discovered
    by onboard sensors. Near Earth Autonomy proposes to develop technologies and capabilities
    leading to fully autonomous systems that are able to discover and adapt to unpredicted
    changes in their environment, and yet still accomplish the mission, with minimal
    or no human involvement. The proposal focuses on developing autonomy in the form
    of sensors and computer software that will enable UAS's of the future to operate
    safely in the NAS. Additionally, the proposal addresses how the technical challenges
    can be met and how the technology developed can be shown to be both trustworthy
    and commercially viable for general aviation. This is aligned with NASA's current
    initiative for safe integration of UASs in the national airspace led by Langley
    Research Center.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
