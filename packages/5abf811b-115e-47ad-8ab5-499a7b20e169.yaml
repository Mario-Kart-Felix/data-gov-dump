    miles of benthic habitat mapped from 2003 to 2004 along the middle to lower Delaware
    Bay Coast. The bottom sediment map was constructed by the utilization of a Roxann
    Seabed Classification System and extensive sediment grab samples. Data was collected
    in a gridded trackline configuration, with tracklines spacing of 100 meters parallel
    to the shoreline and 200 meters perpendicular to the shoreline.This project is an
    extension of the work currently being performed in Delaware waters by DNREC's Delaware
    Coastal Program's Delaware Bay Benthic Mapping Project.The bottom sediment point
    data, which has been classified according to the existing benthic mapping Roxann
    box plot, are converted from a number that categorizes the point according to its
    corresponding box (in the Roxann) into a number which reflects the sediment properties
    of each box in relation to one another. A ranking scale is used to allow a statistical
    griding scheme to interpolate between sediment data points, while minimizing erroneous
    sediment classifications and allowing gradational sediment deposits to be grided.
    A ranking scale from 0 to 28 was used for this project, with 0 representing the
    finest grained classifications (fluidized clay) and 28 representing the coarsest
    grained classifications (dense shell material). Table 1 illustrates the distribution
    of sediment classifications along the ranking scale, which takes into account the
    relation of sediment types and grain sizes to one another using both the Wentworth
    Scale and Shepard's classification system. Finer grains are more similar in their
    deposition environments, such as clay and silts, because they reflect similar current
    regimes, sorting, and reworking patterns (Poppe et al., 2003). While coarse sediments
    are much more dissimilar to finer grains, with respect to current velocities, sorting,
    and winnowing, the finer grains are much more closely related in their sediment
    diameters that the coarser grains as you increase in Phi size and/or diameter. These
    account for the close clustering of coarse grained deposit descriptions at the upper
    end of the ranking scale, while the finer grained sediments show a gradation as
    you increase in the rating scale.The bottom sediment data is grided in Surfer 8,
    a surface and terrain modeling program, using block kriging and a nugget effect.
    This statistical griding technique estimates the average value of a variable within
    a prescribed local area (Isaaks and Srivastava, 1989). Block kriging utilizes the
    existing point data values, weights the values of the data depending upon the proximity
    to the point being estimated, to discretize the local area into an array of estimated
    data value points and then averaging those individual point estimates together to
    get an average estimated value over the area of interest (Isaaks and Srivastava,
    1989). A variogram is constructed for the data, and the resultant spatial model
    that is developed from the variogram is used in the block kriging surface model
    to more accurately interpolate the sediment data . The fitted model was a nugget
    effect (with an error variance of 21.8%) and a linear model (with a slope of 0.00286
    and an anisotropy of 1, which represents a complete lack of spatial correlation).
    The accuracy of the estimation is dependent upon the grid size of the area of interpolation,
    the size of each cell within the grid, and the number of discretized data points
    that are necessary to estimate the cells within that grid spacing. The grid size
    that was used to interpolate the bottom sediment maps was 442 lines x 454 lines,
    with a cell size of 44.93 m2. The nugget effect is added to allow the griding to
    assume there is very little, if any, lateral correlation or trends within the bottom
    sediment (Isaaks and Srivastava, 1989). The nugget effect model entails a complete
    lack of spatial correlation; the point data values at any particular location bear
    no similarity even to adjacent data values (Isaaks and Srivastava, 1989). Without
    the nugget effect the griding would assume that you could only have a linear progression
    of sediment types and would insert all the sediment types along the scale between
    two sediment types (i.e. silty fine to medium sands and fine to medium sand with
    varing amounts of pebbles would beinserted between fine sand and coarse sand even
    though that is not what is occurring along the bottom. The sediment data is grided
    with no drift for the data interpolation, also helping to minimize erroneous classifications.
