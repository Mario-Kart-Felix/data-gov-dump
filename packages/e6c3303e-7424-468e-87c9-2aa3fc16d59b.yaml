    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "NASA has a critical need for improved bi-directional
    data transmission rates from a variety of spacecraft to Earth.  NASA estimates that
    the current Mars to Earth transfer rate of 6 Mbps might be increased to 600Mbps
    using a Laser Communication (LC) system.  Beam jitter caused by spacecraft-based
    motion must be reduced to sub-microradian levels to enable beaconless optical beam
    pointing.  ATA will create a Compact, Lightweight Isolation Platform (CLIP) that
    will host the LC collimator telescope and provide a stabilized platform to prevent
    the 150-microradian spacecraft disturbance environment from reaching the LC terminal.
     To enable that stabilization, ATA will develop an ultra-low angular noise Capacitive
    Angular Position Sensor (CAPS).  The proposed sensor will have low power and high
    reliability, which ATA will demonstrate by producing TRL 4 prototypes in Phase I
    and TRL 5 CLIP engineering development unit (EDU) in Phase II.rnThe integrated CLIP
    overall design is a major innovation.  Most significantly, the platform payload
    capacity must increase from the typical few hundred grams to as much as 50 kilograms,
    roughly two orders of magnitude, but without major growth in the mass of the platform
    itself.  While the payload for most stable platforms is only a small fraction of
    the platform overall mass, the CLIP payload must be from more than half (3 kg) to
    as much as 94 percent of the total platform mass (3-50 kg payload + 3 kg platform).
     Combined with the large payload range, the needed disturbance rejection from 150-microradian
    to less than 0.5-microradian across the broad frequency range of 0.1 to 500 Hz requires
    innovation in the platform suspension, high-performance actuators, servo controls,
    and structure.  Other programs have demonstrated these requirements individually,
    but the innovation CLIP provides is to combine structure, suspension, actuators,
    and sensors to give the required performance within the stringent 3-kg weight and
    15-W power constraints.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
