  processes that are important for understanding the electrical properties of materials,
  both single crystal minerals and igneous rocks, both laboratory-grown and from natural
  environments.  The prevailing view in the geophysics community is that the electrical
  conductivity structure of the Earthu2019s continental crust over the 5-35 km depth
  range can best be understood by assuming the presence of intergranular fluids and/or
  intergranular carbon films. Based on studies of melt-grown MgO, magma-derived sanidine
  and anorthosite feldspar and upper mantle olivine single crystal we present evidence
  for the presence of electronic charge carriers, the importance of which has been
  largely ignored. These charge carriers derive from peroxy defects, which are introduced
  during cooling, under non-equilibrium conditions, through a redox conversion of
  pairs of solute OHu2013 arising from the solid state dissolution of H2O.  It can
  be shown that, during reheating, the peroxy defects become thermally activated in
  a 2-step process. Step 2 leads to the release of defect electrons in the oxygen
  anion sublattice. Known as positive holes and symbolized by hu2022, these electronic
  charge carriers are associated with energy states at the upper edge of the valence
  band. They are highly mobile.  Chemically equivalent to Ou2013 in a matrix of O2u2013
  they are highly oxidizing. However, though metastable, the hu2022 can exist in minerals,
  which crystallized in highly reduced environments. The hu2022 appear to control
  the electrical conductivity of crustal rocks over much of the 5-35 km depth range.
  We make the extraordinary and seemingly paradoxial claim that MgO crystals, grown
  from the melt under the viciously reducing conditions of a carbon arc fusion furnace,
  contain peroxy defects in their crystal structure, hence oxygen in the valence state
  1u2013.  When the peroxy defects break up, they release positive hole charge carriers,
  formally defect electron in the oxygen anion sublattice, equivalent to Ou2013 in
  a matrix of O2u2013.  These positive holes have two outstanding properties: they
  are highly mobile and highly oxidizing.\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S. Government

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
