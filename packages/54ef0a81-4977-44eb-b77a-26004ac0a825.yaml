    1 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of the north shore of Buck Island
    St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD
    personnel, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal,
    and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin
    Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101
    ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS
    HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and
    has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from
    NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The processed CARIS data
    was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle with footprint size
    3*3. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap
    9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster', with
    cell size 1, was used to generate the final ESRI Grid. While the project was conducted
    to meet IHO Order 2 accuracy standards, there is a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m
    high) in the dataset that the user should take into consideration when performing
    any analysis.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
