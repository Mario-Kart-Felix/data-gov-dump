  ISRU Resource Acquisition &lt;/em&gt;project element will develop two technologies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exploration
  Ground Data Systems (xGDS)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sample Acquisition on Asteroids,
  Mars, Moons of Mars, and Lunar Cold Traps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A primary
  technology of this element is development of HRS&amp;rsquo;s Exploration Ground
  Data Systems (xGDS) software, a set of planning, monitoring, archiving, and search
  tools for dealing with data sent to or received from robotic spacecraft or crew
  systems.&amp;nbsp; xGDS is being matured through technology development under HRS
  (with STMD funds) and field-tested with funds from the Human Exploration and Operations
  Mission Directorate (HEOMD) and Science Mission Directorate (SMD).&amp;nbsp; The
  outcome of this development will be that the desired parts of the xGDS system (likely
  the traverse planner, real time plotting, and raster mapping tools) will be ready
  to be infused into the lunar Resource Prospector Mission (RPM).&amp;nbsp; The scope
  of FY14 xGDS work includes maturing time delayed image and video processing and
  archiving tools and adding support for mobile devices.&amp;nbsp; During 2014, xGDS
  will support the AES-funded Regolith and Environment Science and Oxygen and Lunar
  Volatile Extraction (RESOLVE) payload thermal vacuum chamber testing the SMD-funded
  Mojave Volatiles Prospector (MVP) project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another technology
  under this element will develop regolith sampling and excavation for reduced and
  low gravity environments.&amp;nbsp; The objective for this work in FY14 is to acquire
  representative samples of target bodies in order to characterize the regolith for
  ISRU prospecting purposes which would also benefit science objectives and other
  relevant Strategic Knowledge Gaps (SKG&amp;rsquo;s). The requirements of the Advanced
  Exploration Systems (AES) lunar Resource Prospector (RP) are focused on a lunar
  South pole mission near the impact site of the recent Lunar CRater Observation and
  Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) mission in order to obtain ground truth on the lunar
  surface.&amp;nbsp; Orbital data from neutron spectrometers shows that most of the
  detected hydrogen on the moon is in these crater floor cold traps. The goal is to
  confirm the existence of volatiles such as water, hydrogen and helium in the regolith
  at the lunar poles.&amp;nbsp; Other target bodies such as asteroids and Mars&amp;rsquo;
  moons will also need prospecting and characterization. One of the primary potential
  uses of the returned asteroid in the Asteroid Initiative is for ISRU demonstrations
  in lunar orbit.&amp;nbsp; Sampling devices will be needed to prospect the asteroid
  for useful resources, such as water on a carbonaceous condrite. The Mars&amp;rsquo;
  moons and Mars itself are also of interest for ISRU purposes and can be sampled
  with robotic devices or by human crews to determine the ISRU value of their regolith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regolith
  excavation and sample acquisition in low gravity environments ( micro-G, 1/3 G,
  1/6th G) is difficult due to the lack of reaction force from the weight of the excavation
  robot.&amp;nbsp; On Earth, excavators are typically large and heavy to take advantage
  of this large reaction force to counter-act the digging forces. In space, new methods
  of digging and sampling must be found, due to their light weight in low gravity
  environments.&amp;nbsp; Percussive excavation is one method for reducing digging
  forces, and in FY14, the HRS project will test interfaces for a large percussive
  excavation end effector: the Vibratory Implement for Percussive Excavation of Regolith
  (VIPER) which is designed to be mounted on the All-Terrain Hex-Limbed Extra-Terrestrial
  Explorer (ATHLETE) robot from JPL. The VIPER was designed and fabricated by HRS.
  A smaller percussive excavation implement called Badger, will be operated on the
  Centaur 2 mobility robot with a positioning mechanism. First, the Badger implement
  will be mounted for Geo-Technical Testing in a Controlled Simulant Bin. Afterward,
  the pair of devices from will be integrated onto Centaur 2 and tested at a NASA
  outdoor test facility.&amp;nbsp; The Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations
  Robot (RASSOR) 2.0 will be completed and tested in a regolith test bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
  objective of this effort is to raise the technology readiness level (TRL) of sampling
  and excavation for reduced and low gravity environments to the point where it is
  viable for future precursor or Asteroid exploration missions.&amp;nbsp; A second
  objective is to have technologies identified and proven to be feasible for lunar
  cold trap access and prospecting which could be a follow-on mission to the Resource
  Prospector.&amp;nbsp; The same technologies may be useful for Mars prospecting at
  the poles. A third major objective is to demonstrate how to reduce digging forces
  and make low -weight excavators possible on low-gravity target bodies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
