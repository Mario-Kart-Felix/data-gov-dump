	"notes": "Anthropogenic inputs of mercury into the environment have resulted in an increasing gradient of mercury from west to east across North America. In conjunction, the current availability of methylmercury (the form of mercury toxic to animals and humans) in aquatic ecosystems is at levels posing risks to human and ecological health. Risk levels vary considerably in response to methylmercury availability, which is affected by lake hydrology, biogeochemistry, habitat, topography, and proximity to airborne sources. The Common Loon was selected as a suitable bioindicator of aquatic mercury toxicity, based on ecological, logistical, and other criteria, including public valuations of natural resources. In New York State, loons were sampled opportunistically in the Adirondack Park from 1998-2000. Based on risk categories developed from the literature and in situ studies by BioDiversity Research Institute and their collaborators, 17% of the breeding loon population in New York is estimated to be at risk from mercury contamination. Loons in the high risk categories were captured on acidic, low alkalinity lakes in the Adirondack Park that had low levels of dissolved organic carbon. As has been found elsewhere in the Northeast, blood mercury levels in adult birds were higher than those in juvenile loons, and adult male loons had higher blood and feather mercury levels than did females. Higher blood and feather mercury levels in male loons reflect both the ability of females to depurate mercury into eggs and the tendency of males to eat larger fish than females. The results of the sampling efforts in New York are coordinated with contaminant sampling in loons throughout the Northeast to better assess the neurologic, behavioral, and physical impacts of mercury toxicity on loons. Population models based on related studies in the Northeast indicate that mercury toxicity has potential to negatively impact breeding loon populations by reducing overall reproductive success. Thus, in New York, it is recommended that population monitoring and contaminant sampling of breeding loons continue through the efforts of the newly established Adirondack Cooperative Loon Program. Such population monitoring programs and continued refinement of population models enable the early detection of declining population trends and the implementation of management efforts, as well as assisting in state and national policies and regulations that reflect the ecological injury mercury is currently having on the freshwater landscape. Results of blood lead levels from loons sampled in New York from 1998-2000 are still pending. Dead loons found by the general public were forwarded to the NYS Wildlife Pathology Laboratory for necropsy analysis. Lead toxicity due to the ingestion of lead fishing tackle accounted for 20% of the mortality in loons necropsied by the NYS Wildlife Pathology Laboratory. Currently, legislation is under consideration in New York to regulate the sale and use of lead fishing tackle. Passage of these bills would eventually reduce the quantity of lead sinkers deposited in New York waterbodies, which should significantly decrease the chances of waterbirds, such as loons, ingesting lead sinkers and developing lead toxicity.",
