    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The EUMETSAT OSI-SAF NAR SST products are
    SST fields derived from NOAA/AVHRR data and available over 6 pre-defined zones,
    4 times per day.  After acquisition and calibration at CMS, the NOAA/AVHRR data
    are re-mapped onto a stereopolar grid to produce mosaics of consecutive orbits over
    Europe and the Near Atlantic at a 2 km resolution. Mosaics are made over a "Rectification
    Grand Domaine" area (RGD). For re-mapped grid points observed by more than one
    overpass, the smallest satellite zenith angle data are selected. In the normal conditions
    when two satellites are operational, four mosaics per day are produced for all the
    AVHRR channels. SSTs are then calculated from these data. Six zones are then extracted
    . They are 1024 * 1024 pixels in size to offer the users (presumably interested
    by local phenomena) the possibility of handling a restricted volume of data. Note
    that SSTs are calculated over the entire RGD, but only the predefined zones are
    delivered as NAR products.The operational CMS AVHRR cloud mask in use is based on
    a multi-spectral thresholding algorithm (Derrien and Le Gleau 1999). Some refinements
    specific to the marine conditions have been introduced including Use of fine scale
    climatology and a fine gradiant climatology to assist in the detection of clouds
    in areas characterised by strong thermal gradients. SSTs are derived from the 11
    and 12 micron brightness temperatures (T11 and T12) . The NOAA /AVHRR has three
    IR channels : channel 3 (3.6-3.8 micron), channel 4 (10.2-11.2 micron) and channel
    5 (11.5-12.5 micron) which provide IR data at 1-km spatial resolution at the satellite
    subpoint (Kidwell, 1997). NOAA-14 and NOAA-16 have similar characteristics, but
    with distinct radiometer filter functions that necessitate distinct algorithm coefficients.
    The algorithms coefficients are derived from multilinear regression on a simulation
    database . At night the use of the 3.7 channel in a triple window algorithm improves
    the SST retrieval performances under high water vapor content conditions.  The expected
    accuracy is defined as the expected bias and standard deviation of the primary calculations
    against drifting buoy measurements determined on a monthly or yearly basis. The
    following performance evaluation was derived from a detailed validation of NOAA/AVHRR
    derived SSTs (Brisson et al 2001). Bias: Apart for the first 2 months after the
    launch of a new satellite, the monthly biases should remain within +/-0.4 K by night.
    By day local biases of several K are possible because of shallow diurnal heating.
    nStandard deviation: see table below: low-cloud cases (cloud coverage less than
    10% of the validation box) have been separated from all cases (cloud coverage less
    than 60%). The "expected maximum standard deviation" or the expected maximum biases
    are the maximum values that can be observed under normal conditions. When these
    values are overpassed, some anomaly may have occurred and the problem must be identified.
    Standard deviation Table Yearly, all Monthly, all Yearly, low-cloud Monthly, lowcloud
    0.7 0.8 0.6 0.7 nPhysical definition nsubskin SST : Comparable to in situ (buoy)
    measurements at night. nRelation to bulk SST: equivalent to bulk SST by night. By
    day, a bias of several Kelvin may be found under favorable diurnal heating conditions,
    nRelation to skin SST: By day and by night the subskin SST is convertible to skin
    temperature by subtracting 0.2K. nUnits and range nUnits: Centi-Kelvins nWhen using
    GRIB format, a scaling factor of 100 must be applied. nNo lower limit is imposed
    on the SST calculations, providing the sea is ice free. The expected range is thus
    from about -3 degC till 35 degC, corresponding to actual values of 27000 to 30800.
    nUnprocessed data (for whatever reason) show a negative value (-32768) in HDF format,
    or is flagged as missing in GRIB section3. nOrigin nSST calculated from the IR channel

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
