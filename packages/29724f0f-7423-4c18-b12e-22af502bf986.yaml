  of constant recharge values for the Tillman terrace and alluvial aquifer in southwestern
  Oklahoma. The Tillman terrace and alluvial aquifer encompasses the unconsolidated
  terrace deposits and alluvium associated with the North Fork of the Red River and
  the Red River in the western half of Tillman County. These sediments consist of
  discontinuous layers of clay, sandy clay, sand, and gravel. The aquifer extends
  over an area of 285 square miles and is used for irrigation and domestic purposes.
  Granite and the Hennessey Formation outcrop in northern parts of the aquifer where
  alluvial deposits are absent. These outcrops were included as part of the aquifer
  in a thesis in which the ground-water flow in the aquifer was modeled. A recharge
  value of 2.87 inches per year was used in the ground-water flow model and in this
  data set. The recharge polygons were derived from two sources. The outer polygon
  representing the outer shell of a model grid for a ground-water flow model of the
  Tillman terrace and alluvial aquifer was digitized from a paper map in a thesis
  at a scale of 1:249,695. Polygons and lines representing geologic contacts were
  extracted from a published digital surficial geology data set based on a scale of
  1:250,000. Small polygons along the eastern boundary of the aquifer were created
  when the outer polygon of the model grid and the geology polygons and lines were
  combined. These small polygons represent geologic units other than the Tillman terrace
  and alluvial aquifer within the model grid. Three small polygons representing outcrops
  of granite and the Hennessey Formation in the northern parts of the aquifer also
  were extracted from the digital surficial geology data set. Ground-water flow models
  are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models
  are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar
  results. Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented in this data
  set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently
  collected data.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\": \"bbox-east-long\",\n\t\t\"value\":

  representing the aquifer as reported by Al-Sumait (1978) was digitized from a map
  published at a scale of 1:249,695. Recharge polygons representing bedrock outcrops
  were constructed from digital data sets by Cederstrand (1996) that were scan digitized
  from mylar maps at a scale of 1:250,000. The recharge polygons represented at this
  scale are indicative of broad, regional trends and should not be interpreted as
  site-specific. The recharge polygon was digitized from a paper map (8 inches by
  11 inches), with a maximum registration root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.005
  map inches 0.013 map centimeters and 364 feet (111 meters) ground distance. Ground-water
  flow models are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems.
  Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce
  similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are closely interrelated.
  As long as these two model inputs are in balance the model has a small mean residual;
  it represents the natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is accurately
  known, the model can be used to accurately determine recharge. Likewise, if the
  hydraulic conductivity is poorly known, then the recharge will be poorly determined.
  Therefore, values of recharge used in the model and presented in this data set are
  not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently collected
  data. Recharge probably varies considerably over the local area, and model recharge
  is at best an average over an area at least as large as the model grid (and probably
  much larger than a single cell).\", \"Access Constraints: None.\"]\"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"key\":
