    field that is concerned with the development of tools and technologies to enable
    automated detection, diagnosis, prediction, and mitigation of adverse events due
    to software anomalies.rnSignificant effort has been expended in the last several
    decades in therndevelopment of verification and validation methods for softwarernintensive
    systems, but it is becoming increasingly more apparent that this isrnnot enough
    to guarantee that a complex software systemrnmeets all safety and reliability requirements.
    rnrnModern software systems can exhibit a variety of failure modes which can go
    undetected in a verification and validation process.  While standard techniques
    for error handling, fault detection and isolationrncan have significant benefits
    for many systems, it is becoming increasingly evident that new technologies and
    methods are necessary for the development of techniques to detect, diagnose, predict,
    and then mitigate the adverse events due to software that has already undergone
    significant verification and validation procedures.rnThese software faults often
    arise due to the interaction between the softwarernand the operating environment.rnUnanticipated
    environmental changes lead to software anomalies that may have significant impact
    on the overall success of the mission.rnBecause software is ubiquitous, it is not
    sufficient that errors arerndetected only after they occur. Rather, software must
    be instrumented andrnmonitored for failures before they happen.rnThis prognostic
    capability will yield safer and more dependable systems for the future.  This paper
    addresses the motivation, needs, and requirements of software health management
    as a new discipline.rnrnPublished in the Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Space

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
