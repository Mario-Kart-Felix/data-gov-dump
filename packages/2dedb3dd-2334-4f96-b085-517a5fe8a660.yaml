    is remotely sensed high-resolution elevation data collected by an airborne collection
    platform. This LiDAR dataset is a survey of areas of coastal New York, including
    Long Island, eastern Westchester, and the tidal extents of the Hudson River. The
    project area consists of approximately 950 square miles. The project design of the
    LiDAR data acquisition was developed to support a nominal post spacing of 1.0 meter
    or better (1.0 meter GSD). The LiDAR data vertical accuracy is in compliance with
    the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA) RMSE estimation of elevation
    data in support of 1 ft. contour mapping products. GMR Aerial Surveys Inc. d/b/a
    Photo Science, Inc. acquired 740 flight lines in 63 lifts between November 2011
    and April 2012, while no snow was on the ground, rivers were at or below normal
    levels, no strong onshore winds, high waves, floods, or other anomalous weather
    conditions. Specified areas of the project were collected at a tide stage where
    water levels are at least 1-foot below mean sea level (MSL). This collection was
    a joint effort by the NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) and the New York
    State Department of Environmental Conservation. The data collection was performed
    with three Cessna 206 single engine aircrafts, utilizing Optech Gemini sensors;
    collecting multiple return x, y, and z as well as intensity data. The data were
    classified as Unclassified (1), Ground (2), Low Point (Noise) (7), Water (9), Breakline
    Edge (10), Withheld (11), Tidal Water (14), Overlap Default (17), and Overlap Ground
    (18), Overlap Water (25), and Overlap Tidal Water (30). Upon receipt, the NOAA Office
    for Coastal Management (OCM), for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes,
    converted these classifications to the following: 1 - Unclassified 2 - Ground 7
    - Low Point (Noise) 9 - Water NOAA tide gauges were used as the basis for flight
    planning the tidally coordinated areas. The Stevens Institute NY Harbor Observation
    and Prediction System (NYHOPS) data were used to confirm accuracy of NOAA predicted
    tides in Hudson. Some areas were collected using tidal restraints as listed below:
    Tidal Wetlands and tributary mouths selected for tidal coordination at Mean Sea
    Level (MSL) minus 1 foot were: Rondout Creek Outlet; Vanderburg Cove, Moodna Creek,
    Constitution Marsh, Iona Marsh, Annsville Creek, Croton River Outlet, Marlboro Marsh,
    Manitou Marsh, Fishkill Creek Outlet, and Wappingers Creek Outlet. The Upper Hudson
    area from North of Goose Island was also collected to the same specification. Tidal
    Wetlands and tributary mouths selected for tidal coordination at Mean Sea Level
    (MSL) were Haverstraw at Minisceongo Creek and Piermont Marsh. On Long Island the
    following areas were collected at MSL: 1) the northern shore of Nassau and Suffolk
    counties from approximately Glen Cove on the western boundary to Nissequogue on
    the eastern boundary 2) the Peconic Bay from Riverhead on the western boundary to
    the east end of Shelter Island and Accabonac Harbor on the eastern boundary 3) western
    Great South Bay. The remainder of the project area had no tidal restrictions for
    collection. LAS tiles indicate if they are tidally coordinated or not. If tidal
    coordination only covers part of the tile the tile will be labeled tidally coordinated
    (i.e.MSL-1). In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications,
    Photo Science, Inc. established a total of 81 control points that were used to calibrate
    the LiDAR to known ground locations established throughout the New York project
    area. Trimble R8-3 GNSS receivers were used to complete the collection. Real Time
    Kinematic (RTK) survey methodology was typically performed using the New York State
    Spatial Reference Network (NYSNet), a CORS/Real Time GPS Network. Additionally,
    control values from various other projects completed by Photo Science in and around
    the project area, were used as supplemental control points to assist in the calibration
    of the LiDAR dataset. The dataset was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum
    of UTM NAD83 (NSRS2007), UTM Zone 18, meters and vertical datum of NAVD1988 (GEOID09),
    meters. Upon receipt, for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes,
    the NOAA Office for Coastal Management converted the data to GRS80 Ellipsoid (GEOID09)
    heights, to geographic (NAD83, NSRS2007) coordinates, and from las format to laz
    format. LiDAR data were collected in RAW flightline swath format, processed to create
    Classified LAS 1.2 files formatted to 2093 individual 750m x 750m tiles, Hydro Flattening
    Breaklines in ESRI shapefile format, 1.0 meter gridded Tidal Water ERDAS IMAGINE
    (.img) files formatted to 670 individual 3000m x 3000m tiles, and 1.0 meter gridded
    V-Datum ERDAS IMAGINE (.img) files formatted to the same 3000m x3000m tile schema.
    LiDAR data were originally delivered to NOAA/Dewberry for quality control validation
    under Delivery Lots 1 and 2. The lineage (data quality), positional, content (completeness),
    attribution, logical consistency, and accuracies of all digital elevation data produced
    conform to the specifications stipulated in NOAA Task Order EA133C11CQ0009 - T011.",nt"license_title":
