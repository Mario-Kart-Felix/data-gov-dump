  Plum Island since before Refuge establishment in 1942. An aerial survey in 1948
  revealed at least 15 deer wintering on the island portion of the refuge. Deer numbers
  increased and peaked at an estimated 38 animals in the mid 1950's. At that time,
  the refuge biologist stated \"the herd is approaching the critical state of the
  carrying capacity\" for the refuge. During January and February, 1956, refuge  personnel
  noted that, \"extensive damage to the limited browse is now evident.\" Deer were
  browsing twigs of pitch pine (Pinus rigida) up to 3/8\" in diameter and were damaging
  the two-year-old Austrian pine (Pinus nigra) plantation. In 1957, an archery hunt
  for deer was initiated and continued for five years. Thirty-five deer were removed
  during this five year period. For the next 16 years; the number of deer on the refuge
  appeared to remain  somewhat stable, at about 12 animals. Deer numbers began to
  increase rapidly in the mid 70's. By 1982 \"numerous\" deer were being seen at all
  times of the year on the refuge, especially in late summer, feeding in the mowed
  fields.  In 1983, an effort was initiated to monitor the trend and nutritional status
  of Plum Island deer. It has been estimated that the refuge habitat can support in
  the range of 15-35 animals during the critical winter months when deer are under
  the greatest environmental stress and green browse such as grasses and forbes are
  not available. The Master Plan for Parker River National Wildlife Refuge, U.S. Fish
  and Wildlife Service, April 1986, page 44, identifies 16 acres of optimum quality,
  806 acres of acceptable quality, and 1,237 acres of  minimum quality deer habitat
  on the refuge. From this data it was calculated that 15-20 (with a peak of 35) healthy
  deer could be maintained on the refuge without causing damage to the habitat - habitat
  which supports many other species of wildlife as well as deer. The December 1986
  Environmental Assessment - Public Deer Hunt has been reviewed and updated and is
  presented for additional public review and comment. The basic changes are the inclusion
  of more current research information and updating of the existing program. Wording
  and text have also been adjusted in an effort to clarify meaning and context.\",\n\t\"owner_org\":
