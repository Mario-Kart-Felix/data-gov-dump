    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The innovation being developed in this program
    is a Mg Hall Effect Thruster system that would open the door for In-Situ Resource
    Utilization based solar system exploration.  Magnesium is light and easy to ionize.
    Performance advantages of a Mg thruster include far higher specific impulse and
    less life limiting erosion.  Additional advantages include low propellant cost and
    low pressure propellant storage. A system efficiency &gt;50&#37; is expected from
    an optimized, high power Mg HET.  More importantly, the Isp for a high efficiency
    magnesium Hall thruster driven by a 400V power processing unit may exceed 5000s.
     For a Mars-Earth transfer, the propellant mass savings with respect to a xenon
    HET system are enormous.  Mg can also be combusted in a rocket with CO2 or H2O,
    enabling a multi-mode propulsion system with propellant sharing and ISRU.  In the
    near term, CO2 and H2O would be collected in-situ on Mars or the Moon. In the far
    term, Mg itself would be collected from Martian and lunar regolith.  In Phase I,
    an integrated, medium power (1-3kW) Mg HET system was developed and tested.  Controlled,
    steady operation at constant voltage and power was demonstrated. Preliminary measurements
    indicate Isp &gt;4000 s was achieved at a discharge potential of 400V. The feasibility
    of delivering fluidized Mg powder to medium or high power thruster was also demonstrated.
    The objective of Phase II will be to evaluate the performance of an integrated,
    high power Mg Hall thruster system in a relevant space environment. In the first
    task, we will improve the medium power thruster system and characterize it in detail.
     In the second task, the knowledge gained will be used to design and build a high
    power (8-20kW) Mg HET. In the third task, a fluidized powder feed system supporting
    the high power thruster will be built and delivered to Busek.  In the fourth task,
    the integrated high power system will be fully characterized.  Measurements will
    include performance and plume properties.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
