The polygons define areas where entities that have entered into or have requested a Negotiated Non-Competitive Lease or Memorandum of Agreement with BOEM can dredge sand, gravel or shell resources from the OCS. Section 8 (k) of the OCS Lands Act (OCSLA), as amended by Public Law 103-426 (enacted in 1994), provides BOEM the authority to negotiate an agreement for the use of OCS sand, gravel, and shell resources for use in: (1) a project for shore protection, beach restoration, or coastal restoration under taken by a Federal, State, or local government agency; or (2) for use in a construction project funded in whole or in part by, or authorized by, the Federal government. This dataset is a collection of proposed, previous, and current authorized lease areas under BOEM's purview. The intent is to update the dataset when leases are proposed, added or renewed. Attribution consists of state, sand volume, and dates and identification properties associated with the lease. Revisions to the data, which would most often be to attribution, will occur regularly.",
