  2010 housing unit count and population. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded
  on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad
  tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county
  limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Blocks are the
  smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial
  census. A block may consist of one or more faces.n\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\":
