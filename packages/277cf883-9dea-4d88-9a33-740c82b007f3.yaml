    simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census Bureau's
    Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing
    (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed for
    small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the
    intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain
    the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas
    may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available
    as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.nnThe
    Cartographic boundary shapefiles include both incorporated places (legal entities)
    and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities).  An incorporated place
    is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as
    opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services
    or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always
    nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.
     An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have
    other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical
    counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled
    concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally
    incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located.  The boundaries
    for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials
    and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated
    place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census
    to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the
    same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  The
    only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some
    housing and population.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
