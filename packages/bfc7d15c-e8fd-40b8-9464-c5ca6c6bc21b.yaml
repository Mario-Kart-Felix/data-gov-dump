    USGS 7.5' DEM Quads for the main 8 Hawaiian Islands. Individual DEM quads were first
    converted to a common datum, and vertical unit, and subsequently mosaicked in ArcGIS
    9.x. The hillshade were created from these DEMs using the Hillshade function in
    ArcGIS 9.2's Spatial Analyst Extension. For all the hillshades, the altitude was
    set at 45, the Z factor at 1 and the output cell size at 10. The azimuth was set
    to 45 for the Hawaii (Big Island), Maui and Kauai hillshades. The azimuth was set
    to 315 for the remaining island hillshades. All rasters are 16 bit signed integers
    with a spatial resolution of 10 meters. They are in the ERDAS Imagine (.img) format
    and are referenced to the NAD83 UTM coordinate system. The hillshade for Hawaii
    (Big Island) is in UTM zone 5N, and the hillshades for the remaining 7 islands are
    in UTM zone 4N. On this metadata sheet, the bounding coordinates and row and column
    counts are for a hypothetical 10m grid that would contain the 8 main Hawaiian Islands.
    For bounding coordinates and the number of rows and columns for each actual, individual
    hillshade, users should consult their respective layer properties.",nt"license_title":
