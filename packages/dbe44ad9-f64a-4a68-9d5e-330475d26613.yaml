    final late-season frameworks from which States may select season dates, limits,
    and other options for migratory bird hunting seasons. The effect of this final rule
    is to facilitate the States' selection of hunting seasons and to further the annual
    establishment of the late-season migratory bird hunting regulations. This dataset
    contains the administrative High Plains Mallard Management Unit delineation that
    is used by states in this process. The High Plains Mallard Management Unit consists
    of all areas in the Central Flyway west of the easternmost areas/boundaries described
    below. North Dakota High Plains Unit: That portion of the State south and west of
    a line from the South Dakota State line along U.S. 83 and Iu00e2u0080u009394 to
    ND 41, north to U.S. 2, west to the Williams/Divide County line, then north along
    the County line to the Canadian border. South Dakota High Plains Zone: That portion
    of the State west of a line beginning at the North Dakota State line and extending
    south along U.S. 83 to U.S. 14, east on U.S. 14 to Blunt, south on the Blunt-Canning
    Rd to SD 34, east and south on SD 34 to SD 50 at Leeu00e2u0080u0099s Corner, south
    on SD 50 to Iu00e2u0080u009390, east on Iu00e2u0080u009390 to SD 50, south on SD
    50 to SD 44, west on SD 44 across the Platte-Winner bridge to SD 47, south on SD
    47 to U.S. 18, east on U.S. 18 to SD 47, south on SD 47 to the Nebraska State line.
    Nebraska High Plains: That portion of Nebraska lying west of a line beginning at
    the South Dakota-Nebraska border on U.S. Hwy. 183; south on U.S. Hwy. 183 to U.S.
    Hwy. 20; west on U.S. Hwy. 20 to NE Hwy. 7; south on NE Hwy. 7 to NE Hwy. 91; southwest
    on NE Hwy. 91 to NE Hwy. 2; southeast on NE Hwy. 2 to NE Hwy. 92; west on NE Hwy.
    92 to NE Hwy. 40; south on NE Hwy. 40 to NE Hwy. 47; south on NE Hwy. 47 to NE Hwy.
    23; east on NE Hwy. 23 to U.S. Hwy. 283; and south on U.S. Hwy. 283 to the Kansas-Nebraska
    border. Kansas High Plains Zone: That portion of the State west of U.S. 283. Oklahoma
    High Plains Zone: The Counties of Beaver, Cimarron, and Texas. Texas High Plains
    Zone: That portion of the State west of a line extending south from the Oklahoma
    State line along U.S. 183 to Vernon, south along U.S. 283 to Albany, south along
    TX 6 to TX 351 to Abilene, south along U.S. 277 to Del Rio, then south along the
    Del Rio International Toll Bridge access road to the Mexico border. Central Flyway--includes
    Colorado (east of the Continental Divide), Kansas, Montana (Counties of Blaine,
    Carbon, Fergus, Judith Basin, Stillwater, Sweetgrass, Wheatland, and all counties
    east thereof), Nebraska, New Mexico (east of the Continental Divide except the Jicarilla
    Apache Indian Reservation), North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming
    (east of the Continental Divide). This boundary was defined as the result of an
    assessment of mallard band-recovery and harvest distributions conducted back in
    the early 1970s.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
