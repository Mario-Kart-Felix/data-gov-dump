    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Over the next decade, a host of new technologies
    and capabilities will be needed by NASA to support Project Constellation. For risk
    reduction considerations, it is desirable that they be flown on other missions prior
    to use on vehicles such as Orion or Altair.  An innovative and cost-effective approach
    to doing so is to use picosats, which are miniaturized spacecraft with masses on
    the order of a few kilograms. Because of their size, weight and power requirements,
    they are ideal for low-cost, quick-turn-around technology demonstration missions.
    Picosats are now being developed at universities by teams of students for "hands
    on" experience with real space hardware. The University of Texas at Austin (UT)
    and Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU), for example, are working with NASA Johnson
    Space Center to implement a series of four picosat missions that would culminate
    in an on-orbit demonstration of autonomous rendezvous and docking (AR&amp;D). This
    is a mission-critical, system-level technology needed by Project Constellation,
    especially Orion. Accordingly, Emergent Space Technologies, Inc. (Emergent) proposes
    to team with UT to move the Platform for Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking with
    Innovative GN&amp;C Methods (PARADIGM) picosats out of the university research realm
    and into the commercial marketplace.  These spacecraft are being built by UT students
    to fly in concert with the picosats being built by their TAMU counterparts. The
    Flight 1 spacecraft are being readied for launch in early 2009 and are primed for
    transition to industry.  Emergent will work with UT and TAMU in Phase 1 to design
    the 3 missions that will follow Flight 1. In Phase 2, we will use our considerable
    engineering expertise and AR&amp;D spaceflight experience to help achieve a successful
    Flight 2.  In Phase 3, we will successfully implement Flights 3 and 4 and in the
    process develop a picosat product line that can be applied to a variety of commercial
    space applications.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
