    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, distance from tree stems to the furthest
    canopy element, and a species survey of secondary forests in Para and Rondonia,
    Brazil, from 2002-2003. The forest areas were defined as Type A and Type B stands.
    Measurements were made in the overstory, understory, and midstory of each stand.
    Type A stands were sampled intensively, with the goal of providing high-fidelity
    spatial information about the 3-dimensional structure of the stand. These stands
    were 60 x 60-m (0.36-ha) areas divided into 10 x 10-m grids of uniform clearing
    and abandonment history and were identifiable from Landsat images. Type B stands
    were sampled extensively, with the goal of providing unbiased estimates of biomass,
    along with some information about the vertical structure of the stand and of spatial
    variability. These stands were polygons of uniform clearing and afforestation history
    based on multitemporal Landsat imagery, and varied in size and shape. The Landsat
    files provide classified land cover for each scene and can be used as a time series
    to evaluate land cover change over time. Each Landsat file is a geolocated land
    cover map based on 30-m Landsat data. NOTE: There were additional files which could
    not be archived due to file problems. Data Quality Statement: The Data Center has
    determined that this data set has missing or incomplete data, metadata, or other
    documentation resulting in diminished usability of this product. Known Problems:
    Some unresolved issues remain where data values are inconsistent with the variable
    descriptions provided with the data set. The site identification and plot identification
    values are not consistently used in all three data files. The variables are not
    adequately described.",nt"owner_org": "d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed",nt"extras":
