    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;In FY15, the HRS Rover Technologies
    will begin design of a prototype rover designed for the lunar surface, begin development
    of resource efficient navigation software that will operate on existing space qualified
    computing systems, and will begin development of rover operational tools to operate
    the rover under time delay.&amp;nbsp; The ultimate purpose of the RP rover is to
    support prospecting and processing of volatiles on the lunar surface.&amp;nbsp;
    This work follows preliminary concepts developed by HRS for AES during FY14, and
    will have four wheel modules on the rover, with each wheel module having independent
    propulsion, steering and active suspension.&amp;nbsp; The rover will have navigation
    cameras on a mast for longer duration planning and hazard cameras under the belly
    of the rover for close-in reactive hazard detection.&amp;nbsp; For the lunar environment,
    the rover will have radiation hardened motor control and avionics, will use conduction
    cooled components and will have means to reject heat to the environment under vacuum
    conditions.&amp;nbsp; The Resource Prospector Design Reference Mission requires
    the surface element (rover plus payload) to operate in a Permanently Shadowed Region
    for up to 6 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rover will have active suspension, 4 wheel
    propulsion, and offset &amp;ldquo;crab&amp;rdquo; steering.&amp;nbsp; The combination
    of these three systems enables the rover to operate in soft regolith by providing
    the ability to use a combination of the offset steering and active suspension to
    lift a stuck wheel from the regolith re-position the wheel and continue roving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At
    the end of FY15, the Rover Technologies task will have generated a functional prototype
    rover designed for operations under a 1G environment, with designs focused on a
    path towards a lunar environment.&amp;nbsp; This prototype will be available for
    functional testing with integrated Science payloads and will be available for testing
    in rockyards and gravity offloaded conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also
    in FY15, development and customization of navigation software will begin.&amp;nbsp;
    This effort will involve researching which parts of the existing HRS developed rovers
    are applicable in the RP mission requirements, then prototyping this work using
    the existing KRex rover.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, through a combination of initial
    KRex testing and then RP rover testing, software for planning, executing, monitoring
    and archiving roving activities will be developed as part of the Rover Technologies
    task.&amp;nbsp; Through these development cycles, the rover software is planned
    to be at TRL 6 prior to project RP PDR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current plans show the
    rover prototype will undergo vibration testing, then component and subassemblies
    will undergo radiation and thermal vacuum testing during FY16.&amp;nbsp; Post environmental
    testing, subsystems will be selectively upgraded based on test results, then re-tested.&amp;nbsp;
    At the end of this development cycle, Rover Technologies (including motor controllers,
    actuators navigation s/w, remote driving tools) are planned to be at TRL 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many
    of the core technologies will leverage prior STMD investment, but will need updating,
    further customization for mission requirements, and to be environmentally tested
    per RP mission environmental specification document, RPM-SPEC-0001 Environments
    Specification.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
