Detailed descriptions of the 2-meter survey method and equipment design can be found in Coolbaugh et al. (2007) and Sladek et al. (2007), and are summarized here.\nThe survey method was devised to measure temperature as far below the zone of solar influence as possible, have minimal equilibration time, and yet be portable enough to fit on the back of an all-terrain vehicle (ATV); Figure 2). This method utilizes a direct push technology (DPT) technique where 2.3 m long, 0.54\u201d outer diameter hollow steel rods are pounded into the ground using a demolition hammer. Resistance temperature devices (RTD) are then inserted into the rods at 2-meter depths, and allowed to equilibrate for one hour. The temperatures are then measured and recorded, the rods pulled out of the ground, and re-used at future sites. Usually multiple rods are planted over the course of an hour, and then the sampler returns back to the first station, measures the temperatures, pulls the rods, and so on, to eliminate waiting time.\nAt Wagon Wheel Gap, 32 rods were planted around the hot springs between June 20 and July 1, 2012. The purpose was to determine the direction of a possible upflow fault or other structure. Temperatures at 1.5m and 2m depths were measured and recorded in the attribute table of this point shapefile. Several anomalous temperatures suggest that outflow is coming from a ~N60W striking fault or shear zone that contains the quartz-fluorite-barite veins of the adjacent patented mining claims.\nIt should be noted that temperatures at 2m depth vary according to the amount of solar heating from above, as well as possible geothermal heating from below.\nSpatial Domain:\nExtent:\nTop:\n4490310.560635 m\nLeft:\n150307.008238 m\nRight:\n433163.213617 m\nBottom:\n4009565.915398 m\nContact Information:\nContact Organization:\nGeothermal Development Associates, Reno, Nevada\nContact Person:\nRichard \u201cRick\u201d Zehner\nAddress:\n3740 Barron Way\nCity:\nReno\nState:\nNV\nPostal Code:\n89511\nCountry:\nUSA\nContact Telephone:\n775-737-7806\nSpatial Reference Information:\nCoordinate System:\nUniversal Transverse Mercator (UTM) WGS\u20191984 Zone 13N\nFalse Easting:\n500000.00000000\nFalse Northing:\n0.00000000\nCentral Meridian:\n-105.00000000\nScale Factor:\n0.99960000\nLatitude of Origin:\n0.00000000\nLinear Unit:\nMeter\nDatum:\nWorld Geodetic System 1984 (WGS \u20191984)\nPrime Meridian:\nGreenwich\nAngular Unit:\nDegree\nDigital Form:\nFormat Name:\nShape file",
