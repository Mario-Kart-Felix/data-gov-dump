    backscatter mosaic of selected portions of seafloor around Mona Island, Puerto Rico.
    NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy
    Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry
    data in Puerto Rico from 2/25/08 to 3/8/08. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted
    Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) in 2008. It was processed
    by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied
    (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using
    final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 19 north, datum
    NAD83. The backscatter component of the bathymetry data was geometrically and radiometrically
    corrected using Geocoder 3.2.1 software. Acoustic backscatter mosaics are an important
    piece of information when characterizing surficial seafloor features and delineating
    benthic habitats. The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards,
    dependent on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate
    the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.",nt"owner_org":
