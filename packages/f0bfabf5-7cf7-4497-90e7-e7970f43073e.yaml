    backscatter mosaic of the Abrir La Sierra Bank off the coast of western Puerto Rico,
    collected using a SeaBat Reson 8124 (200 kHz) multibeam echosounder.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA
    Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory,
    federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the
    U.S. Caribbean from 4/14/07 to 4/24/07. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg
    Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) and with a moon pool-mounted Reson
    8124 multibeam echosounder (200 kHz). It was processed by a NOAA contractor using
    CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity)
    and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from
    NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 19 north, datum NAD83. The backscatter component
    of the bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using Geocoder
    3.0 software. Acoustic backscatter mosaics are ostensibly an important piece of
    information when characterizing surficial seafloor features and delineating benthic
    habitats.The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards,
    dependent on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate
    the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.",nt"owner_org":
