    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The 'Pit Study' was meant to identify the
    remnants of former oil extraction sites which pose the threat of creating an oil
    spill. These remnants include many other items besides the pits suggested by the
    study title. e.g. tank batteries, collection and separation apparatus, metering
    stations and wells. In these coastal water areas, erosion frequently exposes oil
    production elements that were formerly buried or on land, such as pipelines and
    manifold headers. Additionally, the cribbing surrounding a well may decay or fall
    away, leaving the well exposed. These exposed elements are susceptible to damage
    by boat traffic as well as a hazard to navigation. Pits of most concern are generally
    associated with production facilities and tank batteries where oil from multiple
    wells is collected. These pits were used for trash and as an emergency overflow
    for oil. Pits associated with wells themselves (Non-hazardous Oilfield Waste or
    NOW pits) generally only contained drilling fluids, rarely oil. These data are held
    in a point dataset [pit_study_LOSCO_1998] representing all completed phases of the
    project - phases 1-7. The point dataset may be linked to five other database files
    ([opametalsap7] [oparemactap7] [opawellidap7] [opasampleap7] [opaassessap7])that
    include attributes related to sampling performed at the site, the assessors who
    made the observations, well cross reference numbers, and recommended remedial action.
    The data set includes an ArcView project file to display the data and make all these
    appropriate linkages. The subjects of the pit study were identified through a variety
    of sources including NASA Aerial Photography, Landsat imagery, and oil well drilling/extraction
    permit data. It is important to note that the permitting process was not implemented
    until the mid 1940's, whereas the oil exploration/production in Louisiana commenced
    about 1906. This means there are many wells present which were never documented
    in a permit. Furthermore, poor location reference points in swampy areas, coupled
    with some operator independence, means that even permitted wells may have been located
    200-300 feet from their permitted location. The contractors for LOSCO used this
    information as a guide for areas to investigate for potential oil spill sources.
    In the field, they noted all apparatus and pits with this potential, even if they
    were not looking for them in particular. The positions of these features were determined
    with GPS. The data associated with each point includes feature type, observations
    on the feature, and in some cases, photographs and/or site plans.",nt"license_title":
