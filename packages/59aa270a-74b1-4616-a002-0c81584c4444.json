	"notes": "Mosquito control districts often use ultra-low volume (ULV) applications of insecticides to control adult mosquitoes. Few field studies have tested the effects of these applications on non-target species. We quantified the effect of ULV applications of synergized pyrethrin, permethrin, and malathion on non-target invertebrates and mosquitofish inhabiting seasonal wetlands on the Sutter and Colusa National Wildlife Refuges (NWR)s in central California. Synergized pyrethrin was applied over three irrigated fields at Sutter NWR, and malathion and permethrin were each applied over two fields at Colusa NWR. There were three control fields at each site. We monitored the abundance, biomass, and species composition of aquatic invertebrates before and after treatments, analyzed water samples for pesticide residue, counted flying insects 'knocked down' by the treatments, trapped flying insects (Colusa only), and tracked survival of caged adult and larval mosquitoes and mosquitofish. Survivorship of larval mosquitoes indicated whether pesticides were deposited in the water in quantities lethal to aquatic insects. We also tested the efficacy of pyrethrin against mosquitoes in riparian vegetation. No reductions were detected in the total abundance or biomass of aquatic macro-invertebrates in treated or control fields in any trial. Aquatic Coleoptera and Ephemeroptera showed lower post-treatment abundances in one treated field each (permethrin and malathion, respectively) but not in the other of the same treatment. Larval mosquitoes showed high survival in all treated and control fields. Mosquitofish died from unrelated causes at Sutter NWR, but all survived at Colusa NWR. All adult mosquitoes died when caged over fields treated with malathion and permethrin. All survived in control fields, indicating that insecticide did not drift into control areas. Abundances of flying insects decreased in both treated and control fields when insecticides were applied, Flying insect abundance rebounded 24 h later in both sets of fields. Our tests of the efficacy of ULV application of pyrethrin in riparian vegetation showed that few caged adult mosquitoes died when wind speeds were approximately 1 mph, but mortality was evident when wind speed was 8- 10 mph. Higher wind speeds allow better penetration of the vegetation. The results of our study suggest that ULV applications of these insecticides for the control of adult mosquitoes do not substantially affect the abundance of aquatic macro-invertebrates or fish in treated wetlands. The reasons for this are discussed.",
