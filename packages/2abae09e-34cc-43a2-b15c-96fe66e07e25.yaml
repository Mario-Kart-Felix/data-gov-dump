    "["Use Constraints: There are several limitations to this dataset and it is important
    they be carefully considered for each particular application. 1. The differences
    between county areas classified as agricultural land in the NLCDe 92 and in the
    1997 county file of agricultural pesticide use (Thelin, 2005) can cause errors in
    the estimated distribution of use. The areas of agricultural land in the 1997 county
    agricultural pesticide use are primarily based on the 1997 Census of Agriculture
    (surveys) while the areas of agricultural land in the NLCDe 92 are based primarily
    on satellite imagery. For counties in which there are temporal and/or areal discrepancies
    between the two primary data sources, the probability of error increases in the
    pesticide grids. Ideally, mapped agricultural land identified by the actual crop
    grown rather than groups of crops (such as row crops, small grains, etc.) would
    be used with the pesticide information by crop, and the information on pesticide
    application and mapped cropland would correlate within the same time period. 2.
    The limitations of each type of data used to estimate use are inherited by this
    dataset: a) Please refer to Thelin and Gianessi (2000) for more information related
    to limitations of the county pesticide use estimates. An example of a limitation
    of the county-level pesticide use data is the non-disclosure of some census crop
    information to protect the identity of individual farmers (U.S. Department of Agriculture,
    1999). Another limitation to consider is that state pesticide-use coefficients (average
    annual application rates and percent of a crop's acres in a state treated with a
    pesticide) are gathered from surveys and reports covering a 4-year period (Gianessi
    and Marcelli, 2000). The total amount of pesticide use by county, as determined
    from the pesticide grids, closely match the total amount of county pesticide use
    from Thelin's (2005) source data (differences are all less than 1 kg). Therefore,
    the grids reflect the pesticide use from the source county data correctly at the
    county scale. However, when sub-county areas (such as small watersheds) are evaluated,
    the potential for error for estimating pesticide use increases. b) The National
    Land Cover dataset 1992 (NLCD 92) is subject to misclassification of agricultural
    land in some areas despite the extensive use of ancillary information (Vogelmann
    and others, 2001). (For additional information related to accuracy assessment of
    the NLCD, see http://landcover.usgs.gov/accuracy/index.php). The pesticide use grid
    dataset incorporates an enhanced version of the NLCD 92 which includes reclassification
    in some areas based on U.S. Geological Survey's Land Use and Land Cover dataset
    of the 1970 and 1980's. Classification of agricultural land is further complicated
    by farmland that is used for multiple crops, or left fallow. 3) The limitations
    described in #1 and #2 above can cause some grid-cell values (estimated pesticide
    application) to be unrealistically high. For example, in a few counties in Texas,
    where much of the pasture lands appear to be classified as "shrubland" in the
    NLCDe 92, tens of thousands of kilograms of 2,4-D are distributed amongst the very
    small areas classified as "pasture/hay". 4) Conversely, the limitations described
    in #1 and #2 can also cause underestimation of pesticide use in areas, where, for
    instance, grasslands are misclassified as "pasture/hay". In these counties, the
    amount of pesticides are distributed over areas that may truly be a mix of grasslands
    and pastured land, which result in a low pesticide use intensity. In addition, this
    "dilution" effect is introduced in the 875 counties in which the CGF areas served
    to substitute ORCH areas due to the absence of land classified as ORCH. 5) The grid
    cells in all 219 agricultural pesticide grids are zero in 42 counties and statistically
    equivalent entities ("county equivalents"). The majority of these 42 counties
    and county equivalents are individual cities that comprise mostly urban land use
    (and therefore indicative of little or no agricultural pesticide use). The amount
    of agricultural pesticide use in these 42 counties and county equivalents are not
    excluded in the pesticide grids but rather combined with its adjacent or surrounding
    county. The counties and county equivalents that have pesticide use combined with
    its adjacent or surrounding county are: COUNTY STATE NAME OF COUNTY CODE (FIPS)
