  located in the Mojave Desert of southeastern Nevada and northwestern Arizona. It
  was impounded in 1935 by the construction of Hoover Dam and is one of a series of
  multi-purpose reservoirs on the Colorado River. The lake extends 183 km from the
  mouth of the Grand Canyon to Black Canyon, the site of Hoover Dam, and provides
  water for residential, commercial, industrial, recreational, and other non-agricultural
  users in communities across the southwestern United States. Extensive research has
  been conducted on Lake Mead, but a majority of the studies have involved determining
  levels of anthropogenic contaminants such as synthetic organic compounds, heavy
  metals and dissolved ions, furans/dioxins, and nutrient loading in lake water, sediment,
  and biota (Preissler, et al., 1998; Bevans et al, 1996; Bevans et al., 1998; Covay
  and Leiker, 1998; LaBounty and Horn, 1997; Paulson, 1981). By contrast, little work
  has focused on the sediments in the lake and the processes of deposition (Gould,
  1951). To address these questions, sidescan-sonar imagery and high-resolution seismic-reflection
  profiles were collected throughout Lake Mead by the USGS in cooperation with researchers
  from University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV). These data allow a detailed mapping
  of the surficial geology and the distribution and thickness of sediment that has
  accumulated in the lake since the completion of Hoover Dam. Results indicate that
  the accumulation of post-impoundment sediment is primarily restricted to former
  river and stream beds that are now submerged below the lake while the margins of
  the lake appear to be devoid of post-impoundment sediment. The sediment cover along
  the original Colorado River bed is continuous and is typically greater than 10 m
  thick through much of its length. Sediment thickness in some areas exceeds 35 m
  while the smaller tributary valleys typically are filled with less than 4 m of sediment.
  Away from the river beds that are now covered with post-impoundment sediment, pre-impoundment
  alluvial deposits and rock outcrops are still exposed on the lake floor. For more
  information on the seismic surveys see http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/operations/ia/public_ds_info.php?fa=1999-014-FA
  These data are also available via GeoMapApp (http://www.geomapapp.org/) and Virtual
  Ocean ( http://www.virtualocean.org/) earth science exploration and visualization
