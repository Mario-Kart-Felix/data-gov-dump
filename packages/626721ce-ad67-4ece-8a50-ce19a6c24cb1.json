	"notes": "Mitigation Target Areas (MTA) were developed by the California Department of Fish and Game for the Interim Mitigation Strategy (IMS). The MTAs are an identification of generalized target sub-areas for initial priority acquisition under the IMS. The MTAs were developed through collaboration between desert land trust experts, BLM, and CDFG biologists. These sub-areas were known to contain high-quality habitat with parcels that may potentially be available for acquisition under the provisions of SB 34. The selected MTAs are intended only for habitat acquisition under the provisions of SB 34 and do not necessarily correspond with mitigation areas yet to be defined after more detailed analyses under the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP) Conservation Strategy. However, it is anticipated that the DRECP Conservation Strategy conservation areas will include portions of the areas designated here as IMS MTAs. The MTAs were developed using ArcGIS 9.3. The sub-regions were selected using 25 square mile hexagons (one of the methods used to display composite spatial data by CDFG - e.g., Bird Species of Special Concern data (WFO 2008)). To identify appropriate MTAs within these sub-regions, the areas were further refined using a standardized, sequential comparison with a series of GIS data layers to select the hexagons with the highest conservation value. The process included examination of the following data: Hexagons that intersected at least one of the following GIS layers were retained: 1. Areas of Conservation Emphasis II (ACE II) - The DRECP includes portions of the ACE II ecoregions: Mojave, Sonoran, and Colorado Deserts, Sierra Nevada, and Southern California Mountains and Valleys. Areas with the highest biological value were retained. 2. California Essential Connectivity Areas (CEHC). 3. Potentially available lands for conservation - hexagons with unclassified or State-owned lands in BLM's Federal and State Surface Estate layer were retained",
