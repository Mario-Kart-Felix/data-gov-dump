    percussive drill designed for space use under a NASA-funded Mars Instrument Development
    Program (MIDP) project ? the Low-force Sample Acquisition System (LSAS). The flight-like
    drill prototype that was the end result of the project successfully drilled and
    acquired 1 cm3 samples from a variety of rocks and soils including the hardest anticipated
    Martian rock (basalt) and frozen soil. This ability was demonstrated not only in
    ambient conditions but also in a thermal/vacuum chamber replicating Mars pressure
    and extreme temperatures. The rotary percussive approach is simple, robust, and
    highly efficient with regards to power and mass.rnrnDuring the SBIR 2006 Phase I
    effort, Alliance took this heritage device and expanded its potential to include
    coring against a variety of rock materials anticipated to be encountered on Mars.
    Through the use of a breadboard fixture, coring bit designs and coring parameters
    were evaluated to identify optimum combinations. At the completion of test a conceptual
    design was generated taking this coring experience into account and adding core
    retention, break and ejection features. A bit change mechanism, identified as a
    requirement for successful operation while maintaining design robustness and simplicity,
    was added as well.rnrnA Phase II effort is now proposed that will take this conceptual
    design into prototype form. Primary activities to be performed during Phase II will
    include:rnrn?tAdditional coring test runs to work out final details of detail bit
    designrn?tDetail design and prototyping of core handling mechanismsrn?tPrototype
    testing of core handling mechanismsrn?tDesign and manufacture of full prototype

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
