At the start, MISTI compiled a baseline stabilization and impact evaluation and survey. For the five waves of surveys, each of which was conducted over several months, a total of 190,264 individual interviews were undertaken in 5,093 different villages across 130 districts of the 23 provinces where stabilization initiatives were being implemented or considered. These data were compiled into one file to facilitate easy access for international development practitioners, researchers and other interested parties in accordance with the USAID\u2019s Open Data Policy. As part of this process, village names and locations have been replaced with unique village identifiers to ensure the safety of Afghan stakeholders. This preserves a researcher's ability to access granular data and see trends at the village-level, but prevents data consumers from attributing responses to a named Afghan village.  The datasets supplied here are in CSV format. These data were analyzed for the MISTI impact evaluation of USAID stabilization programming in Afghanistan, 2012-2014.  USAID\/Afghanistan\u2019s MISTI ranks as the largest and most comprehensive trends analysis and impact evaluation of stabilization interventions that the U.S. Government has ever undertaken. It is also the only one to date subjected to peer review; in addition, three peer review papers for publication in leading journals and a presentation for the 2015 annual conference of the American Evaluation Association are in preparation.",

	"notes": "The raw data from the Measuring Impact of Stabilization Initiatives (MISTI) project is the largest and most comprehensive evaluations of stabilization interventions ever undertaken by USAID.  The MISTI dataset contains five semi-annual iterations or \u201cwaves\u201d of surveys conducted by Management Systems International (MSI) from September 2012 through November 2014 to assess the impact of USAID projects on stability and resilience at the district and village levels in Afghanistan.  The main objective of the stabilization projects covered by the surveys, including the Stability in Key Areas (SIKA) programs, the Community Cohesion Initiative (CCI), the Afghan Civilian Assistance Program II, and the Kandahar Food Zone (KFZ), was to promote good governance and stability by building connections between government leaders and local communities.  USAID\u2019s efforts in these projects included training local government officials on how to manage projects, producing manuals that informed the public on how to tap into government services, and providing support for small-scale public works projects.  MISTI data analysis included village demographic characteristics, violent incident counts, stabilization and the National Solidarity Programme (NSP) project activities.  Perception indicators from interviews of 190,264 people conducted in 5,093 villages across 130 districts and 23 provinces in Afghanistan, has already yielded important insights that will inform U.S. and Afghan Government policy and practice related to transition. You can find all the MISTI Impact Evaluation reports on USAID\u2019s Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC) by clicking on the references below.  And, you can find a more complete description of the project by looking at the Fact Sheet included in that same list of references. ",
