    estimates of total atrazine use on 16 agricultural crops and four agricultural land
    uses between 1992 and 2007. For each year, atrazine use was estimated for all counties
    in the conterminous U.S. (except California) by combining (1) proprietary data from
    the DMRKynetec (DMRK) AgroTrak database on the mass of atrazine applied annually
    to agricultural crops, (2) county harvested crop acreage, from the 1992, 1997, 2002,
    and 2007 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Censuses of Agriculture, and (3)
    annual harvested crop acreage from the National Agriculture Statistics Service (NASS)
    for non-Census years between 1992 and 2007. Annual DMRK estimates of pesticide use
    on individual crops were derived from surveys of major field crops and selected
    specialty crops in multicounty areas referred to as Crop Reporting Districts (CRD).
    The CRD-level atrazine-use estimates were disaggregated to obtain county-level application
    rates by dividing the mass (pounds) of pesticides applied to a crop by the acreage
    of that crop in the CRD, to yield a rate per harvested acre. When atrazine-use estimates
    were not available for a CRD, crop, or year, an estimated CRD-level rate was developed
    following a hierarchy of decision rules that checked first for the availability
    of a crop application rate from surveyed atrazine application rate(s) for adjacent
    CRDs for a specific year, and second, the rates from surveyed CRDs within for USDA
    Farm Production Regions for a specific year or multiple years. The estimation method
    applied linear interpolation to estimate crop acreage for years when harvested acres
    for a crop and county were not reported in either the Census of Agriculture or the
    NASS database, but were reported by these data sources for other years for that
    crop and county. Data on atrazine use for the counties in California were obtained
    from farmers' reports of pesticide use collected and published by the California
    Department of Pesticide Regulation-Pesticide Use Reporting (DPR-PUR) because these
    data are more complete than DMRK survey data. National and state annual atrazine-use
    totals derived by this method were compared with other published pesticide-use estimates
    and were highly correlated. The method developed is designed to be applicable to
    other pesticides for which there are similar data; however, for some pesticides
    that are applied to specialty crops, fewer surveys are usually available to estimate
    application rates and there are a greater number of years with unreported crop acreage,
    potentially resulting in greater uncertainty in use estimates.",nt"license_title":
