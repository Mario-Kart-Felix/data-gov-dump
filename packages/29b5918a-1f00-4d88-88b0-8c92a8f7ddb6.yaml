    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is
    the layer of air closest to the ground which is directly influenced on a daily basis
    by the heating and cooling of the earth's surface. The exact depth of the ABL varies
    according synoptic weather conditions and the time of day. During the daytime it
    is usually between 1 and 3 km; during the night it is much shallower. The ABL is
    important because it links the fluxes of heat and water vapor observed at the surface
    to the general circulation of the atmosphere. To model climate correctly, it is
    necessary for the ABL to be well understood and represented in the model. Because
    the air in the ABL is turbulent, small scale variations (about 1 km or less) in
    evaporation and heat flux at the surface are smoothed, with the temperature, humidity
    and depth of the ABL being uniform over the entire area. Larger scale variations
    (on the scale of 10 km or more) may lead to differences in ABL properties between
    the different surface types. Such differences may cause local atmospheric circulations
    to develop which may be important for the local climate of an area. During ABRACOS,
    three ABL measurement campaigns were carried out. These campaigns were called the
    Rondonia Boundary Layer Experiment (RBLE) 1, 2 and 3 and were held at Ji-Parana
    where the scale of the forested and deforested areas is large enough for each surface
    type to develop its own ABL. Refer to the related data set, Pre-LBA Anglo-Brazilian
    Amazonian Climate Observation Study (ABRACOS) Data, for additional information.The
    processed, quality controlled and integrated data in the documented Pre-LBA Data
    sets were originally published as a set of three CD_ROMs (Marengo and Victoria,
    1998) but are now archived individually.  The campaigns were held during the dry
    season when the difference in evaporation between the two surfaces types, forest
    and pasture, is at its greatest. Measurements were made with both free-flying radiosondes
    which measure temperature, humidity, and wind up to about 12 km and with a tethered
    balloon which makes more detailed measurements in the lowest 1 km of the atmosphere.
    Measurements were made at both the forest and clearing sites. Profiles of potential
    temperature measured during RBLE2 show that the daytime ABL was deeper over the
    clearing than the forest. The data have been used to test several models of ABL
    development. It appears that the ABL over pastures or over clearings grows more
    rapidly than predicted by the models, possibly because of the increased turbulence
    generated by the strips of forest typical of this area. The data have also been
    used to initialize one-dimensional climate models used in experiments to investigate
    the sensitivity of climate to land surface parameters, and to initialize a mesoscale
    model which can predict local effects on climate caused by the pattern of deforestation
    in this area.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
