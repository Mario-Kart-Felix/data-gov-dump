  Quality from Forests and Canopy The intent of this issue is to: Identify are the
  areas of greatest need with respect to air quality and where forests can have the
  greatest benefit. Air Quality was addressed with the following data layers: 1. Non-attainment
  areas Non-attainment areas were obtained from the Idaho Department of Environmental
  Quality. These are areas within Idaho where air pollution levels persistently exceed
  the national ambient air quality standards may be designated \"nonattainment.\"
  EPA considers any geographic area that meets or has pollutant levels below the NAAQS
  an attainment area. Under ideal circumstances, all of Idaho would be classified
  as 'attainment'. An area with persistent high pollutant levels is designated a nonattainment
  area. This means that the area has violated federal health-based standards for outdoor
  air pollution. Each nonattainment area is declared for a specific pollutant. This
  means that the same area could be 'attainment' for one pollutant, but 'nonattainment'
  for a different pollutant. Nonattainment areas for different pollutants may overlap
  each other or share common boundaries. This layer was used to select all the HUC6
  watersheds that contained non-attainment areas. HUC6 watersheds that contained a
  non-attainment area were given a value of 5 and HUC6 watersheds that did not contain
  a non-attainment area were given a value of 0. 2. Fire Impact Zones The Fire Impact
  Zones came from the Montana / Idaho Airshed Group. http://www.smokemu.org/index.php
  Air Impact Zones are areas where smoke is likely to be a problem because of local
  topography, meteorology, and areas with existing air quality problems which smoke
  will exacerbate, or other factors. http://www.fs.fed.us/r1/fire/nrcc/smoke_web_pages/AS-IZ_Map.pdf
  The air impact zones were given a value of 5 and other areas with no air impact
  zone were given a value of 0. Impervious surfaces and Canopy came from the National
  Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 imperviousness layer that was produced through a
  cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC)
  Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies www.mrlc.gov.
  For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer
  to http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. 3. NLCD 2001 Impervious Surfaces The NLCD_2001_impervious
  layer was classified on the percent imperviousness value by natural breaks into
  5 classes and weighted as follows: Class %_Impervious Weight 0 0-6 0 1 7-17 1 2
  18-30 2 3 31-46 3 4 47-65 4 5 66-100 5 The Impervious surface weight was lowered
  by the mean percent canopy cover weight 4. NLCD 2001 Canopy Cover The NLCD_2001_canopy
  layer was classified on the percent canopy cover value. A neighborhood mean canopy
  cover was created from the canopy cover by taking the mean value of the 25 (5 by
  5) neighboring cells for every cell. The mean canopy cover value is a measure of
  the canopy cover surrounding impervious areas. The mean canopy cover was grouped
  by natural breaks into 5 classes and weighted as follows: Class Mean %_Canopy Weight
  1 0-17.43 0 2 17.43-38.35 1 3 38.50-59.27 1 4 59.27-78.69 2 5 78.69-100 3 Issue
  Process: This map is created additively from areas that did not attain air quality
  standards, smoke impact zones, and impervious surfaces. The additive result was
  reclassified into 5 classes based natural breaks giving resulting values of 0 to
