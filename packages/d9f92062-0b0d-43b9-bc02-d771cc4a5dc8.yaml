    intensity of the sea floor of the Historic Area Remediation Site (HARS), located
    offshore of New York and New Jersey. The data were collected with a multibeam sea
    floor mapping system on surveys conducted November 23 - December 3, 1996, October
    26 - November 11, 1998, and April 6 - 30, 2000. The surveys were conducted using
    a Simrad EM 1000 multibeam echo sounder mounted aboard the Canadian Hydrographic
    Service vessel Frederick G. Creed. This multibeam system utilizes 60 electronically
    aimed receive beams spaced at intervals of 2.5 degrees that insonify a strip of
    sea floor up to 7.5 times the water depth (swath width of 100 to 200 m within the
    survey area). The horizontal resolution of the beam on the sea floor is approximately
    10% of the water depth (3-5 meters in the survey region). Vertical resolution is
    approximately 1 percent of the water depth, or 0.3 m. Maps derived from the mulitbeam
    observations show sea floor topography, shaded relief, and backscatter intensity
    (a measure of sea floor texture and roughness) at a spatial resolution of 3 m/pixel.",nt"license_title":
