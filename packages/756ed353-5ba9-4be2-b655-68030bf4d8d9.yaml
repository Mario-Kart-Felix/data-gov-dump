  for fish and wildlife, and a number of National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) were established
  along the river to protect migratory birds, species listed under the Endangered
  Species Act, and habitats necessary for the survival of these species. Fish and
  wildlife are exposed to environmental contaminants entering the Columbia River from
  point and nonpoint sources. Even when released in small concentrations, some contaminants
  can biomagnify and harm top level predators, and can impact species using NWR lands.
  We collected sediment, invertebrates, fish, and eggs of piscivorous and non-piscivorous
  birds in 1990 and 1991 within various river segments to determine contaminant concentrations,
  compare concentrations within river segments, identify concentrations in biota that
  exceed guidance or reference levels, evaluate the magnitude of exceedances using
  hazard quotients (HQs), and derive biomagnification factors (BMFs) for persistent,
  bioaccumulative compounds. BMFs were used to develop target fish concentrations
  (TFCs), or the concentrations in fish estimated to be protective of upper trophic
  level species such as bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). We collected samples
  in the lower Columbia River below Bonneville Dam (four river segments including
  three NWRs), at Umatilla NWR and above McNary Dam, and in the lower Willamette River
  near Portland. We found most organochlorine (OC) pesticides were below detection
  in sediment in biota. However, similar to previous and concurrent studies, the pesticide
  transformation products DDE and DDD were the most commonly detected and most elevated
  compounds in biota from both rivers. DDE was detected in all fish samples during
  both years of the study, and in nearly all samples of clams and bird eggs. Polychlorinated
  biphenyls (PCBs), represented as total Aroclor PCBs or by summing individual congeners,
  were commonly found in fish and bird egg samples, but were rarely detected in sediment
  or invertebrates. Mercury was detected in all invertebrates and birds eggs, and
  in most fish sampled. In invertebrates, mercury was below estimated guidance values
  for the protection of avian invertebrate predators, but some fish samples exceeded
  these guidance values. Mercury in eggs of some piscivorous birds in the lower river
  segments exceeded values associated with impaired reproduction in sensitive individuals.
  Although bioaccumulative contaminants were near or below detection limits in sediment
  and invertebrates, our results document biomagnification of some OC compounds to
  concentrations likely resulting in adverse impacts to piscivorous birds. Results
  did not indicate that individual river segments differed in their contribution to
  the contaminant concentrations observed in biota. This trend indicates that the
  river receives contaminants from numerous widespread sources, and that contaminants
  were evenly distributed in biota. The role of bed sediment in contaminant transfer
  to biota in the river is unknown, and additional information is needed to characterize
  this role and to develop better management strategies for bed sediment disturbance.
  We recommend a basin-wide strategy to better control release of bioaccumulative
  contaminants to the river and minimize impacts to fish-eating birds, to monitor
  changes in OC contaminants over time, and to better address contaminant uptake from
  sediment sources.\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"License Not Specified\",\n\t\"extras\":
