  Fisheries Independent Survey (SEFIS) are conducting research on Red Snapper (lutjanus
  campechanus). The multibeam data covers a total of 232 sq km and was collected in
  2010 by the NOAA Ship Nancy Foster with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002
  multibeam echo sounder (95 kHz). It was processed by NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography
  Branch using CARIS HIPS 7.1 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude,
  sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final
  approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. The processed CARIS data was used to
  generate a CARIS BASE surface using CUBE. The CARIS export option \"BASE Surface
  to ASCII\" was then used to create a GeoTiff of the priority areas in ArcGIS 10.
  Curvature was derived from this surface using the profile curvature function in
  ArcGIS 3D Analyst.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\":
