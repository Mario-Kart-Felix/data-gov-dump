    parameters, texture, and color are reported for 185 georeferenced soil profile sample
    points over four forested headwater catchments near Juruena, Mato Grosso, Brazil
    (Novaes Filho, et al., 2007a and Novaes Filho, et al., 2007b). Samples were collected
    from an approximately 20 x 20 m grid over each watershed from 2004/05/01 to 2004/08/18.
    By sampling each location at depths of 0-20 and 40-60 cm it was possible to distinguish
    and map the principle soil classes found in the study area to the 2nd category level
    of the Brazilian System of Soil Classification (Cooper et al., 2005) associated
    with the topographic relief. The data set contains one comma separated ASCII data
    file with spatially referenced soil nutrient and organic carbon data from 0-20 cm
    (A layer, topsoil) and 40-60 cm (B layer, subsoil)depths for the Juruena watersheds
    study area.A satisfactory relationship between the redness index of the diagnostic
    horizons and the soil class colors was also found. In spite of the apparent homogeneity
    of the visible landscape characteristics such as slope, soil color, and vegetation,
    the carbon and soil clay attributes were found to vary greatly. This variability
    over small distances demonstrates that extrapolation of soil characteristics and
    soil carbon stocks to larger areas could produce erroneous results if the spatial
    variability of the soil attributes is not taken into consideration.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
