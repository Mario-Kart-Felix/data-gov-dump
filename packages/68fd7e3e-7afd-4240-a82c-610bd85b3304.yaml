    (FOQA) programs are implemented by most of the aircraft operators. Vast amounts
    of FOQA data are distributed between many computers, organizations, and geographic
    locations. This project develops methodology for transforming such distributed data
    into actionable knowledge in application to aircraft health management from the
    vehicle level to the fleet level to the national level. The distributed data processing
    methodology provably obtains the same results as would be obtained if the data could
    be centralized. The data mining methods are efficient and scalable so that they
    can return results quickly for 10Tb of distributed data.rnrnThis data mining technology
    that we call Distributed Fleet Monitoring (DFM) developed in SBIR Phase I satisfies
    these requirements. The data are transformed into models, trends, and anomalies.
    The model training and anomaly monitoring are formulated as convex optimization
    and decision problems. The optimization agents are distributed over networked computers
    and are integrated through remote connection interface in a scalable open grid computing
    framework. Though the data and the computations are distributed, they yield provably
    the same optimal solution that would be obtained by a centralized optimization.rnrnDFM
    feasibility was demonstrated in the problem of monitoring aircraft flight performance
    from fleet data using large realistic simulated datasets. We demonstrated efficient
    computation of quadratic optimal solution by interacting distributed agents. The
    feasibility demonstration successfully recovered aircraft performance anomalies
    that are well below the level of the natural variation in the data and are not directly
    visible. The algorithms are very efficient and scalable. Phase I demonstration extrapolates
    to processing 10Tb of raw FOQA data in under an hour to detect anomalous units,
    abnormal flights, and compute predictive trends.",nt"license_title": "U.S.

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
