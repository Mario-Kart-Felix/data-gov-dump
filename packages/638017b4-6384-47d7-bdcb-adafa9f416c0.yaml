    several issues relating to water and sediment quality within the Huleia National
    Wildlife Refuge which was prompted by recent residential and light industrial development
    upstream. The goals were to address any possible exposure risks to endangered birds,
    establish baseline information regarding chemical contamination within the Refuge,
    and help in directing appropriate management action and future planning. Sediment
    contamination within the Refuge and the streams feeding into it; implications for
    local endangered bird species. Basic water parameters measured in situ showed normal
    water conditions, except at site 8 where dissolved oxygen was lower than expected.
    - Of the 151 different chemicals analyzed for in sediments, only concentrations
    of arsenic, chromium, mercury, and nickel were considered significant with the potential
    to cause ecological harm at the majority of sample sites. Water samples were not
    available for analysis. The exposure risk was determined to be low for protected
    bird species whose primary diet is benthic invertebrates. No significant exposure
    pathway routes between contaminated sediments and these receptor species could be
    established based on the surveys and chemical analysis available for this report.
    However, data gaps did exist. There is potential exposure risk for birds whou2019s
    diet is predominantly aquatic plants. Arsenic, lead, and nickel can bioaccumulate
    in aquatic plants, but this risk was not verified since plant tissue concentrations
    were not measured. - Hawaiian soils and sediments often show higher baseline trace
    metal concentrations than that found in the conterminous US which must be considered
    when making toxicological decisions. Sources for some of the uniformly high but
    suspect sediment metal levels were not clear and may be a result of naturally elevated
    local baseline levels or unknown anthropogenic inputs. Recent upstream land development
    and its effects on sediment and water quality within the Refuge and streams feeding
    into it. There is possible evidence for a minor input of anthropogenic metals from
    the development into Puhi and Papakolea Streams. This input is minimal and does
    not quantitatively add to local toxicity. A quantitative baseline for 151 contaminants
    in sediments has been established for assessing future potential impacts of the
    development and other insults. Future management of the refuge as freshwater taro
    wetlands or saline mudflats. Contaminant content in runoff from the recent development
    was minimal and did not alter water quality within the Refuge. Management of the
    Refuge should not be altered based on this concern. There was insufficient information
    to assess the water quality of the tidally influenced Nawiliwili Stream which may
    be the potential saline water source for the Refuge if it is converted to saline
    mudflat habitat. Periodic monitoring of water and sediment quality should continue
    in order to asses impacts from future development with the additional goal of assessing
    water quality during rain events when high runoff would be expected from the developed
    areas. A study should be conducted to assess the metal concentrations in the food
    sources of the endangered birds with specific focus on aquatic plants and algae.",nt"license_title":
