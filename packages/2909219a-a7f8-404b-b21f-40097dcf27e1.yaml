  for Lasercomm Science (OPALS), which is part of the JPL Phaeton early career employee
  hands-on training program, aims to demonstrate optical communications technology.
  This is accomplished by transferring a video from hardware onboard the ISS to our
  ground receiver at JPL&amp;rsquo;s Optical Communications Telescope Laboratory (OCTL)
  in Wrightwood, California. To aid the ISS investigation in accurately pointing the
  downlink laser to the ground telescope, a laser beacon is transmitted from the OCTL
  to the ISS investigation, which is tracked by the investigation as the ISS travels
  across the sky. Each demonstration lasts for approximately two minutes during which
  the ISS and ground telescope maintain line of sight. The OPALS instrumentation gathers
  technical data during these demonstrations, which is then studied to determine hardware
  performance, with the goal of improving the design of next-generation optical communications
  systems.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The scientific instruments in
  near-Earth and deep space missions increasingly require higher communication rates
  to transmit acquired data back to Earth, or to support high-data-rate applications
  (e.g., high-definition video streams). Optical communications (also referred to
  as lasercomm) is an emerging technology in which the data is modulated onto lasers
  to transmit the information. Because laser beams are significantly narrower than
  radio-frequency (RF) beams, optical communications offers the promise of delivering
  much higher power, and thereby achieving much higher data rates than the state of
  the art with RF beams. However, because laser beams are very narrow, the spacecraft
  must be able to very accurately point the laser beam to the receiving telescope
  on Earth as it travels across the sky, which is one of the primary challenges of
  lasercomm.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optical communications has
  the promise of meeting the high data rate expectations of future scientific instruments
  flying on NASAs missions, and improving the interconnectivity between near-Earth
  assets, such as the ISS, and Earth. OPALS is one of NASAs first demonstrations of
  an optical communications link from near Earth, and is designed to help chart the
  path for enabling optical communications in future missions. OPALS collects sensor
  data during the demonstrations to determine the performance of its laser link. The
  investigation team plans to use this data to advance the design and performance
  of future lasercomm links built to support NASAs space endeavors. Additionally,
  OPALS is used to educate a team of early career employees being trained as the next
  generation of JPL/NASA employees to develop space-based technologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
