    $99,055.69 to enhance multiple mission support in ground stations through the use
    of software defined radios and virtual machines to create a software-defined ground
    station (SDGS).  This proposal responds to NASA SBIR topic S4.09 "Autonomous Multi-Mission
    Virtual Ground and Spacecraft Operations". The significance of our SDGS work is
    that the monolithic, stovepipe, and hardware centric nature of ground stations will
    be reduced.  Major system components will be moved to software, thereby promoting
    remote, network-based maintenance, upgrades, and new technology development.  Off
    the shelf software modules will be available, but also mechanism for low-level ground
    station customization for mission specifics; all done remotely over the Internet.
     Costly hardware upgrades will be reduced or eliminated. Our innovation is in the
    intelligent combination of software-defined radio techniques and virtual machines.
     This enables a near complete software solution to primary ground station functions.
    It simplifies ground station hardware and enables flexible application support.
    In Phase 1 we propose to architect an SDGS system for support of expected small
    satellite missions.  We will prototype basic elements with an on orbit or engineering
    model satellite system from our partners. Commercial applications include communication
    support for satellites and high altitude balloon systems.  Our customers will include
    NASA, NSF, DoD, and private satellite builders such as universities and venture
    space. The PI, Dr. James Cutler, has extensive small satellite and ground station
    experience.  He has prototype a global ground station network to operate satellites
    as if they were nodes on the Internet. Our facilities located in Northern California
    have tools for computer and radio development, and access to small satellite systems
    and ground station resources.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
