    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em"&gt;Several
    methods for the production of graphene have been developed in recent years. The
    most promising techniques for the production of high-quality bulk graphene-based
    devices begin with graphite oxide (GO). Several methods to reduce GO have been developed,
    including chemical, thermal, and flash reduction. Not all of these methods produce
    high quality graphene and the ones that do, use relatively expensive equipment.
    A new and inexpensive solid state method developed by this proposal&amp;rsquo;s
    co-investigator at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em"&gt;University
    of California Los Angeles (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em"&gt;UCLA)
    produces high quality graphene films with a surface area of 1500 m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup
    style="line-height:1.6em"&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em"&gt;/g,
    which is much larger than that reported for thermally or chemically converted graphene.
    Oxygen reduction with this method reaches much higher values than the more widely
    used chemical reduction method. These graphene sheets are mechanically strong, have
    high electrical conductivity, and can be used directly as electrodes in energy storage
    devices. This form of graphene is potentially useful for ultracapacitors with remarkable
    energy and power densities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new experimental setup
    for the reduction of GO based on the University of California Los Angeles laser-scribed
    graphene (LSG) method was designed at the Kennedy Space Center laboratory. This
    new method uses a diode pumped laser system with tunable power and short wavelengths.
    After a few months of optimization, the method successfully produced high quality
    graphene electrodes. This process results in graphene with a reduction level that
    is superior to traditional methods for the reduction of GO. This low oxygen content
    is required for building durable supercapacitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;X-Ray Photoelectron
    Spectroscopy (&lt;strong&gt;XPS&lt;/strong&gt;)&amp;nbsp;analyses of the graphene
    sheets that we have produced show that the carbon content of the films ranges from
    96&#37; to 98.5&#37; while the oxygen content is in the range of 1.4&#37; to 3&#37;.
    By comparison, more widely used chemical reduction methods reduce oxygen content
    to 10&#37; or higher. The carbon and oxygen content of the unreduced graphene oxide
    ranges between 66&#37; to 70&#37; and 29&#37; to 32&#37; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graphene
    electrode sheets were made into solid squares for parallel-plate laser-scribed electrochemical
    capacitors (LSG-EC). LSG-ECs were driven through multiple charge/discharge cycles
    at the UCLA laboratory. The devices lose only about 3&#37; of its capacitance after
    10,000 cycles. The shelf life of these devices was also measured.&amp;nbsp;The capacitancs
    of these devices&amp;nbsp;is retained after 120 days.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
