    continuous fields of vegetation cover from multi-temporal Advanced Very High Resolution
    Radiometer (AVHRR) data using all available bands and derived Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI). The continuous fields describe sub-pixel proportions of
    cover for tree, herbaceous, bare ground and water cover types. For tree cover, additional
    fields describing leaf longevity (evergreen and deciduous) and leaf morphology (broadleaf
    and needleleaf) were also generated. The modeling of carbon dynamics and climate
    require knowing tree characteristics such as these. These products were resampled
    and aggregated to 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree grids for the International Satellite
    Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) data initiative II. The data set describes
    the geographic distributions of three fundamental vegetation characteristics: tree,
    herbaceous and bare ground cover, plus a water layer. For tree cover, leaf longevity
    and morphology layers were produced.This data set is one of the products of the
    International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project, Initiative II (ISLSCP
    II) data collection which contains 50 global time series data sets for the ten-year
    period 1986 to 1995. Selected data sets span even longer periods. ISLSCP II is a
    consistent collection of data sets that were compiled from existing data sources
    and algorithms, and were designed to satisfy the needs of modelers and investigators
    of the global carbon, water and energy cycle. The data were acquired from a number
    of U.S. and international agencies, universities, and institutions. The global data
    sets were mapped at consistent spatial (1, 0.5 and 0.25 degrees) and temporal (monthly,
    with meteorological data at finer (e.g., 3-hour)) resolutions and reformatted into
    a common ASCII format. The data and documentation have undergone two peer reviews.ISLSCP
    is one of several projects of Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) [http://www.gewex.org/]
    and has the lead role in addressing land-atmosphere interactions -- process modeling,
    data retrieval algorithms, field experiment design and execution, and the development
    of global data sets.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
