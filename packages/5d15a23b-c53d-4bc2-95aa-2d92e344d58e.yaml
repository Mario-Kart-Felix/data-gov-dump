    of software applications used widely to plan for and respond to chemical emergencies.
    All of the programs in the suite work interactively to share and display critical
    information in a timely fashion; the programs can also be used individually. ALOHA
    (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) is a hazard modeling tool used to evaluate
    the atmospheric dispersion of hazardous chemical vapors, as well as some fires and
    explosions. ALOHA prompts the user to enter basic scenario information (such as
    weather conditions and details about how the chemical is escaping), and ALOHA will
    create a threat zone estimate of the area where a hazard (such as toxicity or thermal
    radiation) has exceeded a user-specified Level of Concern (LOC). CAMEO is a database
    application (with eight modules) designed to assist with the data management requirements
    under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). CAMEO Chemicals
    features an extensive database of chemical datasheets that provide critical response
    information, including physical properties, health hazards, air and water hazards,
    and recommendations for firefighting, first aid, and spill response. Additionally,
    it also has a reactivity prediction tool that can be used to estimate what hazards
    (such as explosions or chemical fires) could occur if chemicals were to mix together.
    MARPLOT (Mapping Applications for Response, Planning, and Local Operational Tasks)
    is a mapping program; users can quickly view and modify maps, and they can create
    their own objects to place on the maps. ALOHA threat zones can be displayed on a
    map in MARPLOT, and objects on the map (such as facilities) can be linked to related
    records in the CAMEO program. Tier2 Submit is an adjunct program in the suite, which
    allows users to complete EPCRA Tier II forms electronically. The facility, chemical
    inventory, and contact information entered into Tier2 Submit can also be imported
    into the corresponding modules in CAMEO.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":

    "["Use Constraints: ALOHA was designed with first responders in mind. Its computations
    represent a compromise between accuracy and speed: it has been designed to produce
    good results quickly enough to be of use to responders. It is intended to be used
    for estimating threat zones for short range, short duration chemical accidents;
    a threat zone is the area where a hazard (such as toxicity, flammability, thermal
    radiation, or damaging overpressure) has exceeded a user-specified Level of Concern
    (LOC). Results produced by ALOHA are estimates and should not be considered precise
    answers. ALOHA results can be unreliable when the following conditions exist: very
    low wind speeds, very stable atmospheric conditions, or concentration patchiness
    (particularly near the spill source). ALOHA does not account for the effects of
    byproducts from fires, explosions, or chemical reactions; particulates; chemical
    mixtures; wind shifts and terrain steering effects; terrain; or hazardous fragments.",
