    of the Maumee River in northwest Ohio flowed through the Great Black Swamp, 7500
    km2 of flat lowland forest (Francis et al. 1979). Water entering Lake Erie from
    the Maumee River was clear. The fish fauna of the area required water free of clayey
    silts and wild rice was abundant in Maumee Bay (Trautman 1981). In the period since
    the mid-1800s the area has been deforested, drained, and canalized for agriculture.
    Runoff from agriculture has caused the Maumee River to become very muddy with an
    annual sediment load to Lake Erie of 1,800,000 metric tons (Francis et al. 1979).
    Beds of inshore aquatic vegetation and spawning areas for many species of fish were
    destroyed by this sedimentation. Navigation channels in Maumee Bay must now be annually
    dredged at great expense. In terms of toxic contamination, Lake Erie is one of the
    cleanest of the Great Lakes. Its primary problem in the past has been eutrophication
    caused by phosphorus from agricultural fertilizers and waste water treatment plants.
    Waste water pollution has come under control in recent years, but agricultural non-point
    pollution remains a problem. Although Lake Erie is relatively clean, there is an
    Ohio fish consumption advisory in effect for carp and channel catfish. The advisory
    was established because these species appeared to contain residues of PCBs above
    the 2 ppm limit set by the Food and Drug Administration. This advisory was based
    on sketchy data, and the State of Ohio is currently conducting a more complete survey
    of contaminants in fish tissue. There has also been speculation that PCBs or other
    contaminants in the lake might be responsible for the poor reproductive performance
    of bald eagles that nest near Lake Erie. Tests of dredge spoil from Maumee Bay show
    relatively low concentrations of PCBs, but I am not aware of sediment studies from
    other parts of the bay. There is a possibility that past discharges of PCB laden
    oil from known sources on Otter Creek and Ottawa River entered Maumee Bay. A 1990
    study by Ohio EPA showed levels of total PCBs in sediments of the Ottawa River to
    range from 0.71 to 110 ppm (Ohio EPA 1991). A tributary storm water runoff ditch
    that receives water from an industrialized area contained sediments with up to 1200
    ppm of PCBs. PCB residues (mainly Aroclor 1248) in fish of the Ottawa River (whole
    body carp, length unspecified) ranged from 9.225 to 84.177 ppm. The concentration
    of PCBs (Aroclor 1248) in sediments from river mile 1 of the Ottawa River, the sample
    site nearest the mouth of the river, was 1.582 ppm. The purpose of this study was
    to survey the northern part of Maumee Bay for PCBs in sediment and in the process
    test out the new immunochemical PCB test kit technology. Discussion and Conclusion:
    Studies by Frank et al. (1977) found sediment PCB concentrations to be 2 or 3 times
    higher in depositional zones of the Great Lakes than in nondepositional zones. A
    study of Lake Michigan by Armstrong in 1981 also found that areas of recent sedimentation
    had the highest PCB concentrations and areas of scour had the lowest levels. Most
    of Maumee Bay is probably an area of sediment deposition. Frank et al. (1977) reported
    the highest sediment concentrations of PCBs in the Western Basin of Lake Erie to
    be 660 ng/g (ppb), 330 ng/g in the Central Basin, and 320 ng/g in the Eastern Basin.
    By these numbers the Maumee Basin sediment concentrations found in this study are
    very low, the highest concentration being 147 ng/g (0.147 ppm). The limitations
    of this study prevent confident conclusions. I can only conclude that samples of
    sediment from Maumee Bay probably contained less than 3 ppm of PCBs.",nt"license_title":
