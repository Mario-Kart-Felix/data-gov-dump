  in 2010, and a final report was submitted to NASA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
  purpose of this investigation was to quantify the joint kinematics and kinetics
  that occur during squat and deadlift exercise on the ARED to inform a future proposal
  that will include a biomechanical analysis of exercise on the ISS. Six subjects
  (3m/3f) were tested while performing single legged squats, normal squats, increased
  range of motion squats, wide stance squats, fast squats, reduced range of motion
  squats, normal deadlift, and sumo deadlift. Ground reaction force (GRF) and motion
  capture data were collected as each subject performed a single repetition using
  a load that approximated their 10 repetition maximum. Testing loads were determined
  during an earlier training session. Three dimensional joint kinematics and kinetics
  were computed using a standard inverse dynamics approach. GRF data indicated that
  peak loads were dependent upon exercise type and that the peak GRF did not always
  occur at the same time during a repetition depending upon the exercise. Bilateral
  joint kinematics were generally symmetrical; however, hip adduction and rotation
  displayed increased bilateral asymmetry. Joint kinetics differed between exercise
  types although there were no specific trends across all variables. In general during
  the downward motion, work was performed on the hip and knee extensors for all exercises,
  and work was performed by the hip and knee extensors during the upward motion. Positive
  and negative work for hip adduction/abduction, hip internal/external rotation, and
  ankle flexion varied across exercises. Bilateral joint kinetics were asymmetrical,
  which may reflect a property of ARED that needs further study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based
  on our results, we suggest that the exercises included in a future flight study
  include, along with the justification:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1)
  Normal Squat: A baseline measure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2)
  Single Legged Squat: Increased net hip torque and only exercise inducing hip adduction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3)
  Wide Normal Squat: Hip adduction and rotation kinematics suggest femoral head loading
  differences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) Normal Deadlift: Baseline
  measure, but with different kinematics than the squat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore,
  we suggest the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Increasing
  the subject size of the current study to allow for standard statistical analyses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2)
  Retest of current subjects bilateral symmetry using a free weight condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3)
  Further study of the FS condition relative to free weights to better understand
  joint kinetic differences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although
  IR squats had larger kinetic values than others, variation was also increased because
  of between subject differences. We did not recommend this lift because of the larger
  subject variation, but this lift should also be considered in a future study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
