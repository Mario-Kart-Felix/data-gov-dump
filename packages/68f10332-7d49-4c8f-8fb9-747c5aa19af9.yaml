    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The North Pacific Pelagic Seabird Database
    (NPPSD) was created in 2005 to consolidate data on the oceanic distribution of marine
    bird species in the North Pacific. Most of these data were collected on surveys
    by counting species within defined areas and at known locations (that is, on strip
    transects). The NPPSD also contains observations of other bird species and marine
    mammals. The original NPPSD combined data from 465 surveys conducted between 1973
    and 2002, primarily in waters adjacent to Alaska. These surveys included 61,195
    sample transects with location, environment, and metadata information, and the data
    were organized in a flat-file format. In developing NPPSD 2.0, our goals were to
    add new datasets, to make significant improvements to database functionality and
    to provide the database online. NPPSD 2.0 includes data from a broader geographic
    range within the North Pacific, including new observations made offshore of the
    Russian Federation, Japan, Korea, British Columbia (Canada), Oregon, and California.
    These data were imported into a relational database, proofed, and structured in
    a common format. NPPSD 2.0 contains 351,674 samples (transects) collected between
    1973 and 2012, representing a total sampled area of 270,259 square kilometers, and
    extends the time series of samples in some areasu2014notably the Bering Seau2014to
    four decades. It contains observations of 16,988,138 birds and 235,545 marine mammals
    and is available from https://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7WQ01T3. Supplementary materials
    include an updated set of standardized taxonomic codes, reference maps that show
    the spatial and temporal distribution of the survey efforts and a query tool.",nt"license_title":
