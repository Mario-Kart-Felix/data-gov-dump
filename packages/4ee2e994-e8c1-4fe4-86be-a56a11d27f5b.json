	"notes": "The ultimate aim of proposed efforts are to develop innovative material and process (M&amp;P) engineering technology to reduce thermal resistance between space power components and cold plates of the space system. This proposal will use AMSENG produced few layer graphene with carbon nano tubes (CNT) to design and process the Advances Thermal Interface Material Systems (ATIMS) to achieve the performance improvement and to achieve the High Heat Flux capability. An increase in mechanical compliance; increase thermal cycles before degradation and efforts to ensure ease of workability for the engineered TIMS are also planned. The proposed tasks use the innovative engineered Graphene-CNT and High K BNNT - AlN conductive phases with use of AMSENG's innovative ultra low out gassing polymers for space application through the computer assisted thermal interface modeling for guiding the material selection. Our aim is to illustrate gains in cyclic durability at operating temperatures between -55C and 200 C. The proposed concepts have possible potential for providing improvements in peak junction temperature rise, &amp; can yield a several fold improvement in cyclic durability, resulting in desired improvements for the robust space based power systems and spacecraft thermal management components. The proposed efforts are also geared to illustrate four fold increase in thermal conductance in thermal greases and state of the art interface materials and targets achieving &gt; 10C reduction in the  junction temperature for the typical heat flux of 50W\/cm2. Plans are also presented to conducts experimental evaluation of the M&amp;P engineering concepts that can suggest further maximization of improvements in ATIMS performance when higher flux rates (100 W\/cm2) are involved.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
