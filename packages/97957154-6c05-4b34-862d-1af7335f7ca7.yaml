    and essential component of USVI coral reef ecosystems. Yet despite their importance,
    striking population and community level changes have occurred in the recent past
    due to fishing pressure and habitat degradation. The monitoring methodologies described
    in this document are necessary for understanding how natural and anthropogenic stressors
    are changing reef fish populations and communities and will be critical for their
    sustainable management. A collaborative research effort between the NOAA's National
    Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment's
    Biogeography Branch (BB) and the National Park Service (NPS) has been used to inventory
    and assess reef fish populations in reef and reef-associated habitats in the northeast
    region of St. Croix from 2001-2011. The survey method previously used has been refined
    to enable broader region-wide coverage at the scale of the USVI yet maintains high
    precision at the Marine Protected Area (MPA) spatial level. Region-wide population
    metric estimates are required to effectively manage reef fisheries but are also
    imperative for spatial management and understanding ecosystem-level processes. For
    example, the ability to place protected fish resources in the context of the greater
    region not only allows for the evaluation of management actions but it also provides
    the ability to determine the ecological role of an MPA in the greater ecosystem.
    The monitoring method previously used by the Biogeography Branch and other partners
    in St. Croix and other regions within the USVI and Puerto Rico will be used to characterize
    and establish baseline data for future monitoring. St. Croix was chosen to serve
    as the first area to implement the protocol and to evaluate the logistics necessary
    to implement a long term monitoring program in the USVI as part of the National
    Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP). Characterization and monitoring of fish communities
    requires a quantitative measure of the spatial distribution and variation of those
    communities. These measures will enable managers to make targeted management decisions
    (e.g. where to allow mooring or where to allow recreational activities such as snorkeling
    and SCUBA diving). Additionally, the spatial setting, both within and outside protected
    regions allows managers to assess the impact, if any, of a change in regulation
    such as the prohibition of fishing. It also enables analysis of any differential
    effect (i.e. the effect may be the same throughout the region or it may be more
    effective toward an edge or center of a management area). To quantify patterns of
    spatial distribution and make meaningful interpretations, we must first have knowledge
    of the underlying variables determining species distribution. The basis for this
    work therefore, is the nearshore benthic habitats maps (less than 100 ft depth)
    created by NOAA's Biogeography Program in 2001 and NOS' bathymetry models. The sampling
    domain includes all hardbottom habitats around St. Croix at depths less than 30m.
    The benthic habitat map and a habitat classification scheme were used to create
    a sample frame constructed with 50 x 50 m grids. Grids were stratified based on
    three variables: Hardbottom habitat type, depth zone, and region/management area.
    Habitat within these grids was stratified into 5 habitat categories (scattered coral/
    rock, pavement, bedrock, patch reef and linear reef) each with two depth classifications
    (shallow (0-11.9 m) and deep (12- 30m)). Further stratification was assigned based
    on management zones and region of the island. There are three managed areas in St.
    Croix. Two federal marine protected areas are managed by the Department of Interior's
    National Park Service: Buck Island Reef National Monument and Salt River Bay National
    Historical Park and Ecological Reserve. The St. Croix East End Marine Park is a
    territorial marine protected area managed by the USVI Department of Planning and
    Natural Resources. Other strata include specific regions of St. Croix: North, East,
    West, and South shores. Overall there were 70 possible strata: 5 habitat types,
    2 depth zones and 8 management areas/regions. The monitoring objectives of this
    protocol are to determine status, trends, and variability in exploited reef fish
    species and communities within the USVI region and inside vs. outside different
    management zones, using measures such as relative abundance (density), spatial distribution,
    size structure and diversity. The survey design is optimized for nine economically
    and ecologically important species in the USVI: blue tang (Acanthurus coeruleus).
    queen triggerfish (Balistes vetula), coney (Cephalopholis fulva), red hind (Epinephelus
    guttatus), foureye butterflyfish (Chaetodon capistratus), French grunt (Haemulon
    flavolineatum), yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus), stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma
    viride) and threespot damselfish (Stegastes planifrons). These species were chosen
    to include a broad range of life history traits as well as a variety of habitat
    utilization patterns. The sample design is optimized with the respect to these species,
    but because all fish species are recorded, monitoring efforts also obtain important
    information about many non-targeted species, the overall trophic structure, and
    form the scientific basis for effective management actions. As such, the sample
    allocation for this mission is based upon the existing community metrics and the
    above species specific distribution from the northeast region of St. Croix. It was
    determined that 250 samples among the various strata would be sufficient to characterize
    hard bottom habitats around the island and have comparable coefficient of variation
    (CV) to values observed in the northeast region of St. Croix. The goal was to survey
    as many of the 250 sites as possible in a two week time period. We organized a strong
    science field team and completed 286 fish and benthic surveys around the island.",nt"license_title":
