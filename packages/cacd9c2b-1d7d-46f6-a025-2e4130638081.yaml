    Coastal and Marine Geology Programu2019s (CMGP) vast collection of unique and valuable
    seafloor and coastal imagery is made available in the CMGP Video and Photograph
    Portal. The portal provides a single location for data discovery and viewing. The
    CMGP and our research partners invest immense resources collecting, processing,
    and archiving seafloor and oblique coastal video and photographs. Until the publication
    of the CMGP Video and Photograph Portal in 2015, only a small number of these data
    sets were available to the public through static web interfaces. Prior to development
    of the data portal, retrieving this imagery most often required internal USGS access
    with specific hardware and software. Furthermore, it was difficult to manage and
    challenging to share such a large amount of information. The Coastal and Marine
    Geology Program (CMGP) Video and Photograph Portal contains imagery spanning from
    2003 to the present. Video and photographs originally collected on analog film media
    have been digitized and processed along with more recently collected digital video
    and photographs to meet a common standard for all CMGP video/photo imagery. The
    Portal is based on an interactive map allowing users to zoom into an area of interest
    and find available USGS imagery. The co-located video and still photographs are
    displayed simultaneously, just as they were acquired in the field. In the portal,
    videos are ultimately stored and streamed as embedded YouTube videos, and photographs
    are stored in Picasa. Presenting the imagery in this way requires multiple processing
    steps and tools, including video and photo editing, database management, and computer
    scripting to automate processing, formatting and quality assurance tasks. A robust
    set of processing tools have been developed to streamline and automate portions
    of the workflow based on the wide range of data types processed so far. However,
    sometimes the data received are uniquely organized and formatted, requiring individualized
    processing. In that case processing tools are updated to accept a wider range of
    data formats and organizational structures.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
