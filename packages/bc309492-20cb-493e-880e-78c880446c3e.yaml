    prove the viability of an Ethernet version of the  MicroSat Systems, Inc. (MSI)
    modular, plug and play (PnP) spacecraft avionics architecture. This revolutionary
    architecture provides a near-term solution to modular, plug and play avionics while
    distributing power and data management functions on a single circuit allowing rapid
    interfacing to other satellite avionics such as the GSFC Space Cube.  By integrating
    the MSI protocol converter technology with the ABET Technologies Digital Current
    System, MSI can provide a network with standardized attachment nodes that carries
    data and power on an Intelligent Power/Data Ring (IPDR).The IPDR network, which
    can host a variety of data protocols, currently implements a high speed SPA-S (SpaceWire)
    core to support the AFRL PnP efforts. It enables full PnP modularity reducing spacecraft
    integration and test to a few days.  Since the system is implemented with a common
    set of nodes for every interface instead of custom cards in a card cage, the hardware
    costs are dramatically lower as well, only 40-60&#37; of comparable centralized
    systems. Using commercial Ethernet parts integrated into the existing IPDR node
    processor and interface boards successful proof of concept testing was performed
    during Phase I.  The transfer of Ethernet data frames was demonstrated into the
    IPDR ring via a peripheral Ethernet device, from one IPDR node to another, and finally
    back out of the ring to the external Ethernet device. Figure 1 shows the setup of
    the final node-to-node Ethernet communication test. Although this testing verified
    the fundamental functionality of Ethernet communication on the IPDR ring avionics,
    there is significant effort remaining to mature this into a flight worthy avionics
    architecture .  The Phase II will investigate flight parts selection for the nodes,
    firmware development required to improve bandwidth, and flight qualification and
    delivery of a Ethernet version of an IPDR node.",nt"license_title": "U.S.

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
