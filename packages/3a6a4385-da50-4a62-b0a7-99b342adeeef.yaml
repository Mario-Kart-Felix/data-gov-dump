    currently operational NASA and International Satellite missions including the NASA
    Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) (1978 - 1986), NASDA's Ocean Color Temperature
    Scanner (OCTS) (1996 - 1997), NASA/GeoEYE Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor
    (SeaWiFS) (1997 - 2010), NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    on both the Terra and Aqua spacecraft (2000 - present) and ESA's medium-spectral
    resolution, imaging spectrometer (MERIS) (2002 - present).  <strong>Level-1A Data
    Products</strong> Level-1A products contain the raw radiance counts from all bands
    as well as spacecraft and instrument telemetry. Calibration and navigation data,
    and instrument and selected spacecraft telemetry are also included. Level-1A data
    are used as input for geolocation, calibration, and processing.  <strong>Ocean Level-2
    Data Products</strong> Each Level-2 product is generated from a corresponding Level-1A
    product.The main data contents of the product are the geophysical values for each
    pixel,derived from the Level-1A raw radiance counts by applying the sensor calibration,
    atmospheric corrections, and bio-optical algorithms. Each Level-2 product corresponds
    exactly in geographical coverage (scan-line and pixel extent) to that of its parent
    Level-1A product and is stored in one physical HDFfile.  <strong>Ocean Level-3 Binned
    Data Products</strong> Level-3 binned data products consist of the accumulated data
    for all Level-2 data corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month,
    or a calendar year.  Each Level-3 binned data product is stored in one or more HDF
    files. Each multi-file product includes a main file containing all product-level
    metadata and data for each bin that are common to all the binned geophysical parameters,
    and multiple subordinate files, each of which contains data of one binned geophysical
    parameter for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated
    main file.  <strong>Ocean Level-3 Standard Mapped Image Products</strong> The Level-3
    standard mapped image (SMI) products are image representations of binned data products
    generated from SeaWiFS, MODIS, OCTS or CZCS data. The data in each SMI product represents
    an image of the parameter specified by the global attribute Parameter. This object
    is a two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical (also known as Platte Carre)
    projection of the globe. The values can be stored as bytes, 2-byte integers, or
    4- byte floats. The first two are scaled real values and may be converted projected
    to geophysical values using the global attributes Scaling, Scaling Equation, Base,
    Slope, and Intercept.  The standard SMI products are generated from binned data
    products, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: chlorophyll a concentration,
    angstrom coefficient, normalized water-leaving radiance at each visible wavelength,
    aerosol optical thickness, epsilon, and diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm.
    For MODIS, products are generated for sea surface temperature (SST), 4 micron SST
    (SST4) and nighttime SST (NSST). Thus, each SMI product represents data binned over
    the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case
    to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products. Each
    SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical
    HDF file.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
