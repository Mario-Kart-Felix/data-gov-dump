  (introduced) marine organisms in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaiian Islands are evaluated
  using a combination of historical records and on-site surveys and findings are compared
  with the results of similar studies conducted in Hawaii and the Pacific. Observations
  and collections were made in November 1999 to January 2000 at 24 stations from variety
  of habitats and environments throughout the bay and from one site at Moku Manu Island
  outside the bay. A comprehensive literature review of published papers and books
  and unpublished reports was conducted to develop a listing of previous species reports,
  and the marine invertebrates, fish, mollusk and algae collections at Bishop Museum
  were queried for information regarding all organisms that had been collected from
  Kaneohe Bay. The assembled data were developed into a relational data base used
  to determine the 1999-2000 percent component of the total biota that was non indigenous
  or cryptogenic, the number of new reports for the bay versus the number of previous
  reports not found, and a chronology of first reports of introductions. The 1999-2000
  surveys observed or collected a total of 786 taxa including 617 species, more than
  six times the number of taxa previously reported by any single survey of biota in
  the bay. Of these, 59% of the total taxa and 51% of the named species were new reports
  for Kaneohe Bay after consideration of nomenclatural name changes. However, only
  24% of the total taxa previously reported for the bay were found by the present
  study. This may be due in part to misidentifications in previous studies, non-sampling
  of meiobiota and plankton by the present study, or actual disappearance of some
  species from the bay such as the introduced mollusk Haliotis sp. However, the results
  suggest that further sampling and observation would produce considerably more taxa
  and species. Historically, 204 nonindigenous or cryptogenic species (collectively
  termed NIS) have been reported in Kaneohe Bay since 1920, and 116 were found on
  the 1999-2000 surveys, the most that have been determined for any single study in
  the Hawaiian Islands or Johnston Atoll. In terms of the component of total identified
  species, NIS composed 18.8%, among the highest percentage components that has been
  found in Hawaii and second only to the 23% value that was determined for Pearl Harbor.
  Fifty-two of the NIS were new reports for the bay. However, all but 16 of the new
  bay reports had previously been reported in Hawaii, and those 16 are designated
  cryptogenic and subject to revision. This dataset includes the complete report from
  this study in PDF format and output from the relational database as spreadsheet
  files.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819\",\n\t\"extras\":
