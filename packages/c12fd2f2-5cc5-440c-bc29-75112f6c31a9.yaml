    are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census
    Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and
    Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed
    for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with
    the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain
    the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas
    may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available
    as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.nnThe
    records in this file allow users to map the parts of Urban Areas that overlap a
    particular county.nnAfter each decennial census, the Census Bureau delineates urban
    areas that represent densely developed territory, encompassing residential, commercial,
    and other nonresidential urban land uses.  In general, this territory consists of
    areas of high population density and urban land use resulting in a representation
    of the "urban footprint."  There are two types of urban areas: urbanized areas
    (UAs) that contain 50,000 or more people and urban clusters (UCs) that contain at
    least 2,500 people, but fewer than 50,000 people (except in the U.S. Virgin Islands
    and Guam which each contain urban clusters with populations greater than 50,000).
     Each urban area is identified by a 5-character numeric census code that may contain
    leading zeroes.nnCounties are the primary legal divisions of most states are termed
    counties.  In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes.  In Alaska, which
    has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs,
    municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas.  The latter are delineated
    cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.
     In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more
    incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute
    primary divisions of their states.  These incorporated places are known as independent
    cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation.
     The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is
    considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation.  The Census Bureau
    treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation:
    Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities
    in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin
    Islands.  The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas
    is covered by counties or equivalent entities.  nnThe boundaries for counties and
    equivalent entities are as of January 1, 2010.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
