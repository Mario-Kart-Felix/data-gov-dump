    with 10x10 meter cell size representing the slope (in degrees) of several deep coral
    priority areas off the South Atlantic Bight, derived from data collected in November
    2010. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel
    Nancy Foster, as well as federal, university, and private sector partners, acquired
    multibeam bathymetry data off the South Atlantic Bight from 11/13/2010 to 11/22/2010.
    Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 122 multibeam echosounder
    (100 kHz). It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Attitude
    and sound velocity correctors applied to the data. Verified tides were not applied
    to the data, leaving the depth values referenced to the ellipsoid. The imagery is
    projected in the UTM Zone 17 north, NAD83 datum. The processed CARIS data was used
    to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. The CARIS Export option "BASE
    Surface to Image" was then used to create a GeoTiff of the priority areas. Slope
    was derived from this surface using the slope calculator, a function of ESRI's Spatial
    Analyst extension.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
