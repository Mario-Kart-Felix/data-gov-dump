	"notes": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) conducted a contaminants investigation at the former skeet range on Great White Heron National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). Once owned by the U.S. Navy, the skeet range and adjacent land were donated to Great White Heron NWR in 1974. The range remained in operation for a total of 31 years, until a refuge compatibility determination found its use in conflict with refuge goals and objectives. Lead pellets and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) found in clay targets are known toxins to fish and wildlife. To delineate the extent of contamination throughout the skeet range and adjacent mangrove areas, a total of 97 soil samples were collected for lead analysis and lead pellet counts. An additional 58 soil samples were collected around clay target debris piles for PAH analysis. A total of 1,323 lead pellets and 648 smaller lead fragments were found in samples from the skeet range. Lead concentrations ranged from 182 mg\/kg to 49,073 mg\/kg, with a mean of 7,436 mg\/kg. Lead content at all sampling sites throughout the skeet range exceeded the Sediment Quality Assessment Guideline based on the protection of aquatic invertebrates and over half were above the State of Florida Soil Cleanup Target Level for residential\/industrial areas. Endangered Lower Keys marsh rabbit fecal pellets collected on the range had a significantly higher mean lead concentration than pellets collected from a nearby reference location. A screening level ecological risk assessment indicated that lead concentrations at the skeet range present a potential risk for marsh rabbits. Total PAH concentrations ranged from 2.93 mg\/kg to 14,926 mg\/kg, with a mean of 1,324 mg\/kg. Risk from PAH exposure was predicted for rabbits at locations closest to the shooting stations, and sixty percent of the samples exceeded environmental health standards for total PAH. Concentrations of chrysene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene, and dibenz(a,h)anthracene, all recognized carcinogens, exceeded standards for environmental health. Based on the finding of this study, the Service recommends that Great White Heron NWR management and U.S. Navy managers take immediate action to remediate the site.",
