    of three parcels; one consisting of approximately 187 acres, one consisting of approximately
    100 acres, and another consisting of approximately 2 acres, currently owned by California
    Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). However, CDFG has indicated that they have limited
    resources to manage Buena Vista. Therefore, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service)
    proposes to accept donation of the 100-acre and 2-acre parcels from CDFG in fee
    title and to cooperatively manage the entire 289-acre property as a unit of the
    Ellicott Slough National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) and State Ecological Reserve (See
    Figure 1). CDFG would retain ownership of the 187-acre parcel and would enter into
    a Memorandum of Understanding with the Service for management of the Buena Vista
    property. This is similar to the current management arrangement at the Refuge where
    the Service manages the entire area, including a 30-acre parcel owned by CDFG.  This
    Conceptual Management Plan (CMP) is for the Service's proposed acquisition and management
    of the Buena Vista Unit of the Refuge and presents a general outline on how Buena
    Vista would be managed. As a conceptual plan, this CMP does not provide extensive
    detail or pinpoint exactly where long-term habitat improvements could be made or
    exactly where public use facilities would be ultimately constructed. Those details
    would be included in the Refuge's Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP), a long-term
    formal planning effort scheduled to begin in 2005 for the Refuge. During the CCP
    planning effort, goals, objectives, and strategies for public use as well as resource
    management will be developed, with input from the public and in accordance with
    the National Environmental Policy Act. This CMP, however, presents a broad overview
    of the Service's proposed management approaches to wildlife, habitats, public uses,
     wildlife-dependent recreational activities, wildfire suppression, rights-of-way,
    easements, law enforcement, and facilities. More specific information is included
    for activities proposed during the interim period, prior to implementation of an
    approved CCP.  As part of the acquisition process, an Environmental Assessment,
    Land Protection Plan, compatibility determinations, and a Section 7 endangered species
    consultation, have been prepared by the Service to analyze the environmental effects
    of establishing and managing the proposed Buena Vista Unit of the Refuge. The purpose
    of the proposed Buena Vista addition is to enhance survival prospects of endangered
    species in the area. This expansion is being proposed primarily to protect the endangered
    Santa Cruz long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum croceum).  The Buena Vista
    property is extremely important to the survival of the Santa Cruz long-toed salamander
    (SCLTS) because of the small number of active breeding populations (11 known), and
    the limited amount of suitable habitat. In addition, acquisition and management
    of this site would benefit other rare species including the endangered robust spineflower
    (Chorizanthe robusta var. robusta) and the threatened California tiger salamander
    (Ambystoma californiense). Buena Vista supports one of only six known populations
    of the robust spineflower, and 135 acres  of the property are included in the designated
    critical habitat (50 CFR 17 36822-36845). Other rare plants on the site include
    Hooker's manzanita (Arctostaphylos hookeri ssp. hookeri) (CNPS 1B), Kellogg's horkelia
    (Horkelia cuneata ssp. sericea) (CNPS 1B), and California bottlebrush grass (Elymus
    californicus) (CNPS 4).",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras":
