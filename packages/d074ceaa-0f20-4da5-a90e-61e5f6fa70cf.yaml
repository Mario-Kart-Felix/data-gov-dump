  The four datasets that predict the probability of elevated concentrations of nitrate
  are differentiated by whether or not they incorporated fertilizer use and whether
  or not they incorporated hydrogeomorphic regions. Each of the eight datasets has
  its own unique strengths and weaknesses. The user is cautioned to read Rupert (2003,
  Probability of detecting atrazine/desethyl-atrazine and elevated concentrations
  of nitrate in ground water in Colorado: U.S. Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations
  Report 02-4269, 35 p., http://water.usgs.gov/pubs/wri/wri02-4269/) to determine
  if he(she) is using the most appropriate dataset for his(her) particular needs.
  This dataset specifically predicts the probability of detecting atrazine/DEA in
  ground water in Colorado with hydrogeomorphic regions and atrazine use estimates
  not included. The following text was extracted from Rupert (2003). Draft Federal
  regulations may require that each State develop a State Pesticide Management Plan
  for the herbicides atrazine, alachlor, metolachlor, and simazine. Maps were developed
  that the State of Colorado could use to predict the probability of detecting atrazine/DEA
  in ground water in Colorado. These maps can be incorporated into the State Pesticide
  Management Plan and can help provide a sound hydrogeologic basis for atrazine management
  in Colorado. Maps showing the probability of detecting elevated nitrite plus nitrate
  as nitrogen (nitrate) concentrations in ground water in Colorado also were developed
  because nitrate is a contaminant of concern in many areas of Colorado. Maps showing
  the probability of detecting atrazine/DEA at or greater than concentrations of 0.1
  microgram per liter and nitrate concentrations in ground water greater than 5 milligrams
  per liter were developed as follows: (1) Ground-water quality data were overlaid
  with anthropogenic and hydrogeologic data by using a geographic information system
  (GIS) to produce a dataset in which each well had corresponding data on atrazine
  use, fertilizer use, geology, hydrogeomorphic regions, land cover, precipitation,
  soils, and well construction. These data then were downloaded to a statistical software
  package for analysis by logistic regression. (2) Relations were observed between
  ground-water quality and the percentage of land-cover categories within circular
  regions (buffers) around wells. Several buffer sizes were evaluated; the buffer
  size that provided the strongest relation was selected for use in the logistic regression
  models. (3) Relations between concentrations of atrazine/DEA and nitrate in ground
  water and atrazine use, fertilizer use, geology, hydrogeomorphic regions, land cover,
  precipitation, soils, and well-construction data were evaluated, and several preliminary
  multivariate models with various combinations of independent variables were constructed.
  (4) The multivariate models that best predicted the presence of atrazine/DEA and
  elevated concentrations of nitrate in ground water were selected. (5) The accuracy
  of the multivariate models was confirmed by validating the models with an independent
  set of ground-water quality data. (6) The multivariate models were entered into
  a geographic information system and the probability GRIDS were constructed.\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"[\"Use Constraints: This dataset should not be used at a scale any larger than
  1:250,000, which is the scale of the soils data used to construct the probability
  GRIDS. Soils data at a larger scale were not available for all regions of Colorado.
  This dataset is one of eight datasets produced by this study. The user is cautioned
  to read Rupert (2003) to ensure that they are using the correct dataset for their
  particular needs. The probability GRIDS developed by this study are designed to
  portray the potential for contamination of ground water in Colorado. These GRIDS
  do not show areas that are actually (currently) contaminated; rather, these GRIDS
  show the areas that have a potential (or likelihood) for being contaminated if a
  contaminant was released to the environment. More specifically, each GRID shows
  the probability of detection (in terms of a percent) of a particular chemical compound
  (the contaminant) in ground water. Probability is not the same as certainty; a well
  in a high probability area is not necessarily contaminated because contamination
  also can depend on well depth and other local factors not taken into account by
  the models used to produce these probability GRIDS. The atrazine/DEA and nitrate
  probability GRIDS were specifically developed for use by the State of Colorado in
  its Pesticide Management Plan to help provide a sound hydrogeologic basis for the
  management of atrazine and nitrogen in Colorado. The GRIDS are intended to be a
  first approximation at developing a consistent rating method for the entire State.
  Additional site-specific data are needed before site-specific decisions are made,
  such as pesticide-use restrictions. The most appropriate uses of these GRIDS are
  to focus prevention programs in areas of greatest concern, to focus ground-water
  sampling programs in areas of greatest potential for contamination, and to assist
  educational programs for ground-water quality protection. The accuracy of the probability
  GRIDS would be improved if (1) larger scale soils data were available in digital
  form, (2) more complete and detailed chemical-use data were available, and (3) a
  larger number and wider distribution of ground-water quality data, particularly
  in rangeland areas, were available. Data differentiating between sprinkler and flood
  irrigation methods would probably improve the accuracy in agricultural areas. Some
  site-specific variables, such as improper well construction and local spills of
  contaminants, were not accounted for in the models. Accounting for ground-water
  flow direction was beyond the scope of this study. Depth to ground water was not
  evaluated by this study because a large-scale statewide coverage was not available.
  Depth to ground water may be an important coverage to develop for future studies.\",
