	"notes": "We detected low concentrations of the groups of agricultural chemicals and petroleum compounds in surface water analyzed with the kits. None of the groups of compounds were detected at a levels that could cause direct mortality to fish and wildlife, but triazines and 2,4-D were found in concentrations that can inhibit photosynthesis and adversely affect phytoplankton growth and succession. Some of the highest triazine and 2,4-D concentrations occurred in surface waters flowing into Kirwin NWR. Toxicity in some of the bioassays indicated that there were episodes of poor water quality in the basin. More comprehensive water monitoring would be required to determine the causes of toxicity to aquatic biota. Selenium concentrations in sediments at two locations [North Kirwin (Kirwin NWR) and Webster] fell into the moderate (Kirwin) and high hazard categories for assessing risks to wildlife. However, selenium concentrations in whole fish were not high. Concentrations of most metals in sediments were low to normal, but lead concentrations in sediments at the North and South Forks near Hoxie were higher than those at all other locations. Seven carp composites contained cadmium concentrations that exceeded the 85th percentile cadmium concentration in fish collected nationally in 1986, but still were very low. We doubt that there are serious effects on biota from those concentrations. A common carp composite and a smallmouth buffalo sample from the Minneapolis site, and carpsucker composite from the Woodston site had mercury concentrations unlikely to affect the fish, but that equaled or exceeded the recommendation for food items of birds. Chlorinated hydrocarbons were not found in sediments and concentrations in fish were very low. Aliphatic and aromatic petroleum hydrocarbon analyses indicate that there was little petroleum contamination of the waters in the basin.",
