    with 30x30 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of several deep coral priority
    areas off the South Atlantic Bight, derived from data collected in 2003. NOAA's
    NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with the College of Charleston,
    as well as the United State Navy Ship Pathfinder (USNS) , and private sector partners,
    acquired multibeam bathymetry data off the South Atlantic Bight from 06/14/03 to
    07/6/03. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam
    echosounder (95 kHz). It was processed by the College of Charleston Department of
    Geology using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound
    velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved
    tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM Zone 17 north, datum NAD83. The
    processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle.
    The CARIS Export option "BASE Surface to Image" was then used to create a GeoTiff
    of the priority areas.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
