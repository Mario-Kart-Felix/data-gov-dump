  (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from
  the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
  Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless
  national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File
  is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to
  cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical
  subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants
  as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau
  delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or
  where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose
  of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation
  of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts
  generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum
  size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous
  with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.
  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.
  Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development,
  and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally
  are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population
  decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.
  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated
  place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental
  unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between
  censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the
  standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may
  consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census
  tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.
  For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced
  for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to
  Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized
  American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range
  9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or
  no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a
  National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code
  range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only
  water area, no land area. This table contains housing data derived from the U.S.
  Census 2010 Summary file 1 database for tracts. The 2010 Summary File 1 (SF 1) contains
  data compiled from the 2010 Decennial Census questions. This table contains data
  on housing units, owner and rental. This table contains population data derived
  from the U.S. Census 2010 Summary file 1 database for tracts. The 2010 Summary File
  1 (SF 1) contains data compiled from the 2010 Decennial Census questions. This table
  contains data on ancestry, age, and sex.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\":
