    Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, from 2010-02-17 to 2010-03-23, reef fish assessment surveys were
    conducted, as a part of Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA), during the Pacific Reef
    Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruise HA1001 in the American Samoa region
    by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries
    Science Center (PIFSC). During the cruise, 34 REA sites were surveyed at Rose in
    the American Samoa region. At each REA site, fish biologists entered the water and
    conducted a fine-scale (~700 m^2) and high degree of taxonomic resolution REA survey
    to assess and monitor species diversity, size distribution, and abundance of fish
    in shallow-water hard-bottom (less than 30 m) habitats. Reef fish assessment surveys
    were focused on cataloging the diversity (species richness), abundance (numeric
    density) and biomass (fish mass per unit area) of diurnally active reef fish assemblages.
    The stationary point count (SPC) method was used to quantify reef fish species.
    Two divers lay out a 30 m transect line, and position themselves at the 7.5 and
    22.5 meter marks. The SPC biologist then records estimated size and abundance of
    all fish within a visually estimated 15-m diameter cylinder centered on the stationary
    diver (7.5-m radius, total area ~ 177m^2 per cylinder). The diver first spends 5
    minutes identifying all fish species in the cylindrical area, then proceeds to count
    and estimate size (total length) for each in a series of "instantaneous" point
    counts or sweeps of the cylinder. Fish were identified at the species level, wherever
    possible. All reef-associated fish, including those in the water column, were surveyed.
    The survey time for each stationary point count survey was approximately 20 min
    and generally four stationary point count surveys (two per diver) were conducted
    at each fish REA site. After completing REA surveys, divers noted the presence,
    at the survey site, of any unusual fish species not counted during SPC counts, in
    order to facilitate species lists per location.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
