    Information:_  This data set has been validated by NREL and wind energy meteorological
    consultants. However, the data is not suitable for micro-siting potential development
    projects. This shapefile was generated from a raster dataset with a 200 m resolution,
    in a UTM zone 15N, datum WGS 84 projection system.rnrnOther Citation Details:  The
    wind power resource estimates were produced by AWS TrueWind using their MesoMap
    system and historical weather data under contract to Wind Powering America/NREL.
    This map has been validated with available surface data by NREL and wind energy
    meteorological consultants.rnrn### License InfornDISCLAIMER NOTICErnThis GIS data
