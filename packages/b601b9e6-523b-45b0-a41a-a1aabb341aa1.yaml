    next generation of web search and advertising will rely on a deeper understanding
    of user intent and task modeling, and a correspondingly richer interpretation of
    content on the web. How we get there, in particular, how we understand web content
    in richer terms than bags of words and links, is a wide open and fascinating question.
    I will discuss some of the options here, and look closely at the role that information
    extraction can play.rnrn**Speaker Bio**rnrnRaghu Ramakrishnan is Chief Scientist
    for Audience and Cloud Computing at Yahoo!, and is a Research Fellow, heading the
    Community Systems area in Yahoo! Research. He was Professor of Computer Sciences
    at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and was founder and CTO of QUIQ, a company
    that pioneered question-answering communities, powering Ask Jeeves' AnswerPoint
    as well as customer-support for companies such as Compaq. His research has influenced
    query optimization in commercial database systems, and the design of window functions
    in SQL:1999. His paper on the Birch clustering algorithm received the SIGMOD 10-Year
    Test-of-Time award, and he has written the widely-used text "Database Management
    Systems" (with Johannes Gehrke).rnrnHe is Chair of ACM SIGMOD, on the Board of
    Directors of ACM SIGKDD and the Board of Trustees of the VLDB Endowment, and has
    served as editor-in-chief of the Journal of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,
    associate editor of ACM Transactions on Database Systems, and the Database area
    editor of the Journal of Logic Programming. Ramakrishnan is a Fellow of the Association
    for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
    (IEEE), and has received several awards, including a Distinguished Alumnus Award
    from IIT Madras, a Packard Foundation Fellowship in Science and Engineering, an
    NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award, and an ACM SIGMOD Contributions Award.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
