    areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate

    "["Use Constraints: Stream order as determined by the Strahler method is dependent
    upon the scale and accuracy of the hydrographic network that is being ordered. The
    primary data source for assigning stream orders to the 1:24,000-scale vector flowlines
    was the USGS digital line graphs (DLGs), representing blue line features on the
    1:24,000-scale topographic maps. Given the acknowledged inaccuracies in the attribution
    of intermittent versus perennial hydrographic features as depicted on these maps,
    all blue line features were included as part of the drainage network and subject
    to ordering. This approach is consistent with the Strahler method as originally
    proposed. However, some of these data were subsequently modified in an attempt to
    account for known differences in drainage density in limited areas of the state
    where density differences could reasonably be attributed to cartographic representation
    by the DLGs and not physical differences in geology and/or hydrology. Specifically,
    areas where DLGs were digitized from provisional 1:25,000-scale 7.5x15-minute metric
    source maps exhibited a significantly higher drainage density than contiguous areas.
    Strahler stream order is very sensitive to drainage density and the overall consistency
    with which blue line features are defined and mapped. To enforce consistency in
    drainage density in those areas with provisional map coverage, the drainage network
    was systematically u0093prunedu0094 based on an empirical upstream drainage area
    threshold value that was representative of the initiation points (network starts)
    of blue line features in neighboring areas. Ordering was performed on the u0093prunedu0094
    network in these areas. The resulting order values represent the best characterization
    possible given the limitations in the currency, accuracy and resolution of the source
    data, and serve the expressed goal of providing a meaningful parameter that can
    support hydrologic assessments of relative stream discharge and classifications
    of channel geometry. The 1:24,000-scale flowline network has not been subject to
    rigorous ground-truthing and, therefore, is subject to significant errors of omission,
    inclusion, and connectivity. Users of these data should be aware that any such error
    has the potential to significantly affect the stream order of downstream reaches.
    Furthermore, errors in the network have been discovered since the ordering was completed
    and additional errors are likely to be identified over time as more and more users
    with local hydrographic knowledge reference the dataset. The vector flowlines will
    be revised accordingly, but no plan exists to maintain the associated stream order
    attributes to be consistent with modified geometry. Significant differences exist
    between stream orders as assigned in this dataset and those assigned in an earlier
    version (1995) by the NH Office of State Planning (now the Office of Energy and
    Planning). Users should carefully consider their objectives when deciding which
    dataset to reference, given that some limitations apply in both cases. An understanding
    of the specific data sources and methods, as documented above and in the accompanying
    metadata records, is critical for appropriate application of the stream order dataset.",
