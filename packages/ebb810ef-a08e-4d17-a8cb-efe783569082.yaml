    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The goal of the project is research and
    development of methods for application of the Hybrid FE-SEA method to aircraft vibro-acoustic
    problems.  This proposal discusses the development and application of new methods
    of structural-acoustic analysis in order to address existing problems in aircraft
    interior noise prediction. The proposed methods are based on a hybrid modeling strategy
    that combines Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA).
    Over the past five years, Vibro-Acoustic Sciences has devoted a considerable research
    effort towards the development of a framework for combining these two analysis methods.
    Recent research carried out by over the past two years has resulted in the development
    of a rigorous solution to this problem. The resulting Hybrid approach has been derived
    in general terms and validated for a number of simple structural-acoustic problems.
    However, the method has not yet been applied to aircraft interior noise prediction.
    A number of candidate aircraft interior noise problems have been identified which
    would benefit greatly from the use of the Hybrid method. The aims of the research
    described in this proposal are therefore: (i) to demonstrate the application of
    the Hybrid method to a number of existing aircraft interior noise problems, (ii)
    to develop the method to ensure it contains sufficient functionality to address
    practical aircraft interior noise problems and (iii) to demonstrate the value of
    the method in the prediction and reduction of noise in airframe systems. rn ",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
