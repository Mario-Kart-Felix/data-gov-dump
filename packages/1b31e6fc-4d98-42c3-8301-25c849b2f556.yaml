    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": " n        The emphasis of this performance
    evaluation is primarily on the economic and financial assessment of one specific
    activity of the Fruit Tree Productivity Project, namely the u201cExtension of fruit
    tree plantations. The evaluation is commissioned by APP/ MCC to take the outcome
    of the previous exercises as the starting point; revise the assumption made therein
    in light of actual situation in terms of outputs achieved and likely outcomes to
    be realized, and fine-tune the working hypothesis with respect to the key variables
    such as the yields and production costs.nnThe approach of the present exercise has
    focused on three aspects that are of crucial importance to the economic and financial
    impact assessment of the project.  (i) The role and the significance of cereal crops
    in the livelihood of the smallholders in the project area, (2) the motivation of
    the stallholder to switch from traditional agricultural practices (TIP) being used
    in fruit tree husbandry to improved agricultural practices (IAP); and (3) the willingness
    of the stallholders to internalize wholly or partly the cost associated with the
    protection of the natural resource base.nnThe impact of the olive expansion activity
    is potentially positive on farmers' income, on food security, and on reducing poverty:
    nnThe Base constant-price ERR was estimated at 12.2% suggesting favorable outcomes
    on beneficiaries as a result of the intervention. While the ERR depends on a number
    of variables associated with fruit production, namely yields of fruit tree, oil
    content, prices and agricultural practices used by participating farmers, it also
    depends on the whether intercropping of cereal crops will be practiced during the
    life of the project and on their yields and prices. Intercropping will remain a
    critical factor in the economic viability of this project, especially if fruit tree
    yields are lower and/or production costs are higher than their corresponding basic
    values. This ERR corresponds to an average intercropping rate of 78%. Without intercropping
    the project economic viability is questionable.nnThe ERR was estimated based on
    the assumption that the contractually required 100% planting success rate is achieved.
    If this if success rate is reduced by 20% and 30% the corresponding ERR is estimated
    at 11% and 10% respectively. nnDue lack of reliable information regarding the status
    of the Soil and Water Conservation works,  no attempt was made to assess the environmental
    benefits of these works and their impact on ERR. One important observation is that
    the ERR would be if the investment cost is reduced by a percentage equivalent to
    the weight of the in total investment cost.  nn-At full development and thanks to
    newly established fruit trees along with intercropping, the food security of the
    participating households is likely to be enhanced.n-While the available information
    is not sufficient to confirm that the project interventions have reached the real
    poor in the project area, one thing is certain is that 80% of the farmers in the
    selected villages obtained 83% of the areas planted. The average area planted by
    each beneficiary is about 1.56Ha. The Provinces that have been targeted by the project
    have high poverty levels.n-During its implementation over 2009-2013, the planting
    activity generated the equivalent of 5.6 million man-days of employment opportunities.
    Tree planting activities under the Project are labor intensive and hence expected
    to generate additional seasonal, but sustained, employment opportunities directly
    associated with the value chain of fruit trees such as pruning, treatment and harvesting,
    transportation services and transformation, in addition to casual labor. It is estimated
    that at full development, an average of 4,700 to 5,000 recurrent seasonal employment
    opportunities would be created annually.n      ",nt"license_title": "License
