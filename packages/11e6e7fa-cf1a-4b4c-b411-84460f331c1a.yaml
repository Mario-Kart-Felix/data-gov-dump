    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Launch vehicles experience extreme acoustic
    loads during liftoff driven by the interaction of rocket plumes and plume-generated
    acoustic waves with ground structures. Currently employed predictive capabilities
    to model the complex turbulent plume physics are too dissipative to accurately resolve
    the propagation of acoustic waves throughout the launch environment. Higher fidelity
    liftoff acoustic analysis tools to design mitigation measures such as deluge water
    and launch pad geometry are critically needed to optimize launch pads for SLS and
    commercial launch vehicles. This STTR project will deliver breakthrough technologies
    to drastically improve predictive capabilities for launch vehicle lift-off acoustic
    environments. Hybrid RANS/LES modeling presently established in NASA production
    flow solvers will be used for simulation of the acoustic generation physics, and
    a high-order accurate unstructured discontinuous Galerkin (DG) solver developed
    in the same production framework will be employed to accurately propagate acoustic
    waves across large distances. An innovative hybrid CFD-CAA method will be developed
    in which the launch-induced acoustic field predicted from hybrid RANS/LES will be
    transmitted to a DG solver and propagated using high-order accurate schemes ideal
    for acoustic propagation modeling. This new paradigm enables: (1) Improved fidelity
    over linear methods for modeling nonlinear launch-induced acoustics; (2) Greatly
    reduced numerical dissipation and dispersion; and (3) Improved acoustics modeling
    for attenuation, reflection, and diffraction from complex geometry. The merits of
    the proposed approach will be investigated and demonstrated in Phase I for benchmark
    CAA applications and plume impingement problems. In Phase II, the methodology will
    be refined and validated against realistic targeted applications.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
