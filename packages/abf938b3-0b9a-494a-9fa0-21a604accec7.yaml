    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "This chapter presents theoretical and practical
    aspects associated to the implementation of a combined model-based/data-driven approach
    for failure prognostics based on particle filtering algorithms, in which the current
    esti- mate of the state PDF is used to determine the operating condition of the
    system and predict the progression of a fault indicator, given a dynamic state model
    and a set of process measurements. In this approach, the task of es- timating the
    current value of the fault indicator, as well as other important changing parameters
    in the environment, involves two basic steps: the predic- tion step, based on the
    process model, and an update step, which incorporates the new measurement into the
    a priori state estimate.rnThis framework allows to estimate of the probability of
    failure at future time instants (RUL PDF) in real-time, providing information about
    time-to- failure (TTF) expectations, statistical confidence intervals, long-term
    predic- tions; using for this purpose empirical knowledge about critical conditions
    for the system (also referred to as the hazard zones). This information is of paramount
    significance for the improvement of the system reliability and cost-effective operation
    of critical assets, as it has been shown in a case study where feedback correction
    strategies (based on uncertainty measures) have been implemented to lengthen the
    RUL of a rotorcraft transmission system with propagating fatigue cracks on a critical
    component. Although the feed- back loop is implemented using simple linear relationships,
    it is helpful to provide a quick insight into the manner that the system reacts
    to changes on its input signals, in terms of its predicted RUL. The method is able
    to manage non-Gaussian pdfu2019s since it includes concepts such as nonlinear state
    estimation and confidence intervals in its formulation.rnReal data from a fault
    seeded test showed that the proposed framework was able to anticipate modifications
    on the system input to lengthen its RUL. Results of this test indicate that the
    method was able to successfully suggest the correction that the system required.
    In this sense, future work will be focused on the development and testing of similar
    strategies using different input-output uncertainty metrics.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
