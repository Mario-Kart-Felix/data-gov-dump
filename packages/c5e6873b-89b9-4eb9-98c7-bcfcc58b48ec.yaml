    autonomously inspects layups created by high speed automated fiber placement (AFP)
    machines. API comprises a high accuracy line scanner to measure surface topology
    of as-made layups driven by a precision articulated arm Robot to perform rapid surface
    scanning of a Layup after tape placement and layup. Key to API is efficient and
    robust software to read very large volumes of line scan data and analyze, classify
    and detect key Layup features very rapidly and reliably. The software retains only
    key features, filtering the raw data by two orders of magnitude to facilitate real-time
    data processing at high scan rates. Software also compares the location of as-made
    features (gaps, overlaps, drops and adds)with the NC program ("virtual layup")
    to identify and record only those as-made features that are out of tolerance.     API
    addresses many of NASA's objectives for this topic:   ? Manufacturing for launch
    vehicles  ? Innovative automated process (AFP)  ? Applies to reliable, large scale
    PMC structure  ? Applies to Autoclave and OOA AFP methods    API provides a powerful
    capability to enhance reliability of structures manufactured by AFP by automating
    a tedious and difficult manual task. In fact, the speed of AFP machines today has
    advanced such that manual inspection now takes as much time, and often more, than
    automated layup requires. API can significantly increase total AFP productivity
    (C-rate) and reduce cost by reducing Inspection time.  Flightware has enlisted the
    participation of two other small businesses in this program to contribute their
    experience and expertise as subcontractors for specific tasks. Furthermore we have
    attracted the interest of larger industry leaders who supply AFP equipment and manufacture
    AFP Aerospace parts in this program, because they recognize its potential value.
         This API program is a manufacturing innovation subject to Executive Order
    13329 "Encouraging Innovation in Manufacturing."",nt"license_title": "U.S.

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
