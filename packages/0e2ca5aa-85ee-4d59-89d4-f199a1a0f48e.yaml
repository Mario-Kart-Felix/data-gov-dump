    are conducted by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands
    Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) as part of biennial Pacific Reef Assessment and
    Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruises. These cruises support NOAA Coral Reef Conservation
    Program (CRCP) long-term goals for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems. 4 towboard surveys (10.9587 km in length), were conducted at Jarvis
    Island in the Pacific Remote Island Areas from 30 January - 28 February 2001 as
    part of RAMP Cruise TC0101. Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general
    description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations
    of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution
    and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for
    assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish
    and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2
    knots and a depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about
    2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver
    records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen
    within 5m either side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual
    is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing
    digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent
    cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and
    censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars
    and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital
    still camera which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed
    for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards
    are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second
    intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second
    intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat.
    A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers
    with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of
    the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length
    of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track.
