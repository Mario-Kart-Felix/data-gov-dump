    acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of Bolinas map area, California. Backscatter
    data are provided as separate grids depending on mapping system or processing method.
    The raster data files is included in "BackscatterA_8101_2004_OffshoreBolinas.zip",
    which are accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreBolinas/data_catalog_OffshoreBolinas.html.
    The acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of Bolinas map area, California, was
    generated from backscatter collected by California State University, Monterey Bay
    (CSUMB), by Fugro Pelagos, and by Moss Landing Marine Laboratory (MLML). Mapping
    was completed between 2004 and 2010, using a combination of 200-kHz and 400-kHz
    Reson 7125, and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounders, as well as 468-kHz SEA
    SWATHPlus and 250-kHz GeoSwath interferometric systems. Moss Landing Marine Laboratory
    mapped the nearshore region north of Bolinas in 2004 prior to the California Seafloor
    Mapping Program (CSMP). The nearshore region from south of Bolinas Lagoon to Stinson
    Beach was mapped by Fugro Pelagos in 2009 for a project outside of the CSMP and
    only bathymetry data were collected. Therefore, note that the shaded relief map
    coverage (see Bathymetry Hillshade--Offshore of Bolinas, California, DS 781) does
    not match the acoustic-backscatter map coverage (see Backscatter A-E--Offshore of
    Bolinas, California, DS 781). Within the acoustic-backscatter imagery, brighter
    tones indicate higher backscatter intensity, and darker tones indicate lower backscatter
    intensity. The intensity represents a complex interaction between the acoustic pulse
    and the seafloor, as well as characteristics within the shallow subsurface, providing
    a general indication of seafloor texture and sediment type. Backscatter intensity
    depends on the acoustic source level; the frequency used to image the seafloor;
    the grazing angle; the composition and character of the seafloor, including grain
    size, water content, bulk density, and seafloor roughness; and some biological cover.
    Harder and rougher bottom types such as rocky outcrops or coarse sediment typically
    return stronger intensities (high backscatter, lighter tones), whereas softer bottom
    types such as fine sediment return weaker intensities (low backscatter, darker tones).
