    alligator habitats with nest density values by habitat zone and parish or management
    unit. Species-specific abundance, seasonality, status, life history, and source
    information are stored in relational data tables (described below) designed to be
    used in conjunction with this spatial data layer. This data set comprises a portion
    of the Gulf-Wide Information System (G-WIS) database for the entire coastal zone
    of Louisiana. The G-WIS data include three main components: shoreline habitats,
    sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources. The Louisiana G-WIS biological
    data layers are primarily based on quantitative LDWF survey data collected over
    the last decade through 1999 or 2000. Species abundance and concentration attributes
    associated with the spatial data are quantitatively expressed as mean densities
    or counts and/or as categorical descriptive values (high, medium, or low population
    densities). See also the NHP data layer, part of the larger Louisiana G-WIS database,

    was developed to provide summary information on sensitive natural and human-use
    resources for the purposes of oil spill planning, environmental assessment, and
    natural resource management. Although the G-WIS database should be a valuable planning
    and resource management tool, it should not be used to the exclusion of other pertinent
    data or information held by state or federal agencies or other organizations. Likewise,
    information contained in the database cannot be used in place of consultations with
    environmental, natural resource, and cultural resource agencies, or in place of
    field surveys. Also, this database and related map products should not be used for
    navigation. Recognize that the information contained in the G-WIS database represents
    known concentration areas or occurrences of natural, cultural, and human-use resources,
    but does not necessarily represent the full distribution or range of each species
    or resource. This is particularly important to recognize when considering potential
    impacts to protected resources, such as endangered species, wetlands, etc. For more
