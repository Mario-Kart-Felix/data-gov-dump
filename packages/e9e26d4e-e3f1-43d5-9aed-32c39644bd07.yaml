    each of the three Cold Land Processes Field Experiment (CLPX) Meso-cell Study Areas
    (MSAs) in northern Colorado, USA, during September 2001 and 2002, and during the
    three Intensive Observation Periods (IOPs) in February 2002 (IOP1), February 2003
    (IOP3) and March 2003 (IOP4). Data collected in September 2001 and 2002 provided
    background gamma radiation measurements necessary to calculate measurements of snow
    water equivalent (SWE) and soil moisture during subsequent winters. Airborne gamma
    radiation measurements of SWE and soil moisture are based on the attenuation of
    natural terrestrial gamma radiation by the mass of water contained in the soil and
    snow. Measurements were collected at 500 feet AGL along flight lines of variable
    length and 300 m width. Measurements are integrated along the entire length of a
    flight line. Flight lines in the North Park MSA were each 9 km in length, with a
    series of three lines (27 km total length) flown in a regular N-S parallel pattern
    spaced 1 km apart. Flight lines in the Fraser and Rabbit Ears MSAs are of variable
    length and direction. nnThe NASA CLPX is a multi-sensor, multi-scale experiment
    that focuses on extending a local-scale understanding of water fluxes, storage,
    and transformations to regional and global scales. Within a framework of nested
    study areas in the central Rocky Mountains of the western United States, ranging
    from 1-ha to 160,000 km2, intensive ground, airborne, and spaceborne observations
    are collected. Data collection focuses on two seasons: mid-winter, when conditions
    are generally frozen and dry, and early spring, a transitional period when both
    frozen and thawed, dry and wet conditions are widespread.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
