    with 10x10 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of several deep coral priority
    areas off the South Atlantic Bight, derived from data collected in September 2009.
    NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy
    Foster, as well as federal, university, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam
    bathymetry data off the South Atlantic Bight from 09/3/09 to 09/7/09. Data was acquired
    with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz). It
    was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors
    applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water
    (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM Zone
    17 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE
    surface based on swath angle. The CARIS Export option "BASE Surface to Image"
    was then used to create a GeoTiff of the priority areas.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
