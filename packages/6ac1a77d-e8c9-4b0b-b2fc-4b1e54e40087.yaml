    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;The GPRSS technology is an in situ
    remediation technique for PCB-contaminated sediments. The technique provides an
    effective and safe method for sediment cleanup operations, eliminating some of the
    inherent risks associated with more traditional cleanup methods such as sediment
    dredging followed by incineration.&amp;nbsp; The GPRSS technique offers both removal
    and degradation of the contaminant, in contrast to the capping in place method,
    which retains significant long-term environmental reliability. The envisioned re-useable,
    polymer-based PCB treating blanket has the potential to be a global, cost saving,
    game-changing technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technology utilizes a two-step
    process for the removal and degradation of the PCBs.&amp;nbsp; In the first step,
    a &amp;quot;blanket&amp;quot; of inert material (such as a simple polymer, i.e.
    polyethylene) is gently lowered into the water system and pushed into the top layer
    of the sediments, penetrating into the zone where benthic population is at the greatest
    risk for bioaccumulation.&amp;nbsp; This &amp;quot;blanket&amp;quot; acts as a PCB
    &amp;quot;sponge&amp;quot;, absorbing the PCBs that are bound to the sediments.&amp;nbsp;
    The second step consists of removing the &amp;quot;blanket&amp;quot;, extracting
    the contaminants trapped within the blanket structure, and exposing the extracted
    PCBs to activated zero-valent magnesium in an acidified ethanol solvent to commence
    degradation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;blanket&amp;quot; has a solid upper
    surface, providing a temporary cap to the contaminated sediments during the treatment
    period.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the &amp;ldquo;blanket&amp;rdquo; is manufactured
    with extruding points, or &amp;quot;fingers&amp;quot;, that depress into the upper
    ten centimeters of the sediment layer, allowing for increased surface area contact
    with the deeper contaminated zone.&amp;nbsp; Both the &amp;quot;fingers&amp;quot;
    and the backing of the &amp;quot;blanket&amp;quot; are hollow to allow for the incorporation
    of ethanol into the interior.&amp;nbsp; This ethanol interior provides a major advantage
    to the GRPSSs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since PCBs are lipophilic and hydrophobic,
    they prefer to dissolve into the ethanol (or similar non-aqueous solvent) if given
    the opportunity.&amp;nbsp;This system affords that opportunity by generating a concentration
    gradient which enhances the rate of PCB transport from the sediment across the polymer
    blanket membrane and into the ethanol interior.&amp;nbsp; Once the PCBs are in the
    &amp;quot;blanket,&amp;quot; they entire system is removed from the sediment and
    the contaminants are extracted out of the blanket and degraded using stepwise reductive
    dechlorination in the presence of the magnesium reactant described above as step
    two.&amp;nbsp; The polymer &amp;quot;blanket&amp;quot; is capable of being re-used
    multiple times.&amp;nbsp; An entire riverbed for example would not be treated at
    a single event, but rather portions would be treated at a time. The reusability
    of the blankets allows them to be reapplied to different regions of the contaminated
    zone as remediation activities progress.&amp;nbsp; Should additional applications
    prove necessary to remediate high starting PCB concentrations to acceptable levels
    at a single site, such as a holding or sludge pond, the reuseability of the blanket
    adds to its cost competitive nature, or to simply treat another contaminated sediment
    zone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
