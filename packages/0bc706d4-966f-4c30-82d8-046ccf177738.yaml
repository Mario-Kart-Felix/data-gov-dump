    Ice Altimetry System (IAS) data seet contains surface elevations ofnthe Antarctic
    and Greenland ice sheets derived from Seasat and GEOSATnradar altimetry data. The
    Seasat data were collected for a continuousn90 days in 1978, at latitudes between
    72 degrees South and 72 degreesnNorth. GEOSAT was launched in 1985 and placed in
    a nearly identicalnorbit to Seasat, also at latitudes of between 72 degrees South
    and 72ndegrees North. The orbit was designed to provide high-densitynmeasurements
    over the Earth's surface, at a maximum grid spacing of 2.7 kilometers at the equator
    and much denser spacing over polar icensheets. Data were acquired between April
    1985 and September 1986.nnInitially acquired by the Johns Hopkins APL (Applied Physics
    Lab)nsatellite tracking facility, the raw altimetry satellite data fromnSeasat and
    GEOSAT were passed on to NASA, via the US Navy. NASAndeveloped slope correction
    routines for the higher slopes over the icensheets, relative to ocean surfaces.
    The data are height profile Leveln3 data and gridded height Level 4 data provided
    by the Oceans and Icenbranch of the Laboratory for Hydrospheric Physics of Goddard
    SpacenFlight Center. Elevations from the full data rate (i.e., onenmeasurement every
    662.5 m) are provided in georeferenced databases.nThese elevations are relative
    to the WGS-84 ellipsoid. Griddednelevations at 10-kilometer and 20-kilometer spacing
    are provided innthe gridded data sets created from the GEOSAT and Seasat data,nrespectively.
    Software to extract and browse subsets of these data isnincluded. The IAS software
    also allows the user to viewncontours created from the gridded data and groundtracks
    of thenfull-rate data.n",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
