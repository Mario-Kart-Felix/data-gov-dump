    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;rntOur knowledge of the outer solar
    atmosphere and solar wind rests to a large degree on our understanding of the underlying
    ionization balance for the observed gas. The outer solar atmosphere is comprised
    of the chromosphere, transition region, and corona. The spectral and thermal properties
    of these and the solar wind are determined by the charge state distribution (CSD)
    for the different elements in the gas. Hence, interpreting spectral observations
    or particle measurements and developing accurate models for the outer solar atmosphere
    and solar wind all depend fundamentally upon reliable ionization balance calculations.
    These CSD calculations rest in turn upon accurate rate coefficients for electron
    impact ionization (EII) and for high electron temperature (Te) dielectronic recombination
    (DR). In the outer solar atmosphere and solar wind, EII is the dominant ionization
    mechanism and high Te DR is the dominant electron-ion recombination process.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntTo
    address these atomic data needs of the solar physics community, we have been funded
    since May 1, 2000 by the NASA Solar and Heliospheric Physics (SHP) Supporting Research
    (SR) program. During this time we have successfully carried out a series of heavy
    ion storage ring measurements and theoretical calculations designed to generate
    new and more reliable recombination and ionization data for the solar physics community.
    The bulk of our effort to date has been focused on DR but recently we have expanded
    our work to include EII. Additionally, using state-of-the-art theoretical DR data
    benchmarked by our SR-supported DR measurements, state-of-the-art theoretical radiative
    recombination (RR) data, and the most recent compilation of EII data, we have generated
    new CSDs for gas in coronal ionization equilibrium (CIE) for all elements from H
    to Zn (Bryans et al. 2009). We have also used these data to analyze coronal observations,
    investigate the solar physics implications of our new CIE results, and look for
    remaining errors in the atomic data (Hahn et al. 2010b).&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntWe
    propose to continue our ongoing reseach program and carry out a series of EII measurements
    using the heavy ion Test Storage Ring (TSR) located at the Max Planck Institute
    for Nuclear Physics (MPIK) in Heidelberg, Germany. A major limitation of almost
    all existing EII data has been the difficulty of providing unambiguous experimental
    results due to the challenge of producing wellcharacterized ion beams. Most ion
    sources generate beams with unknown fractions of metastable and ground state ions.
    The storage ring approach effectively solves this problem by storing the ion beam
    long enough that essentially all metastable levels radiatively decay to the ground
    state before data are collected.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntWe plan to carry out new
    EII measurements at TSR for nine iron ions: Fe ix, x, xi, xiv, xv, xvii, xviii,
    xx, and xxi. Here and throughout we label the ionizing or recombining systems using
    the inital charge state of the ion. We focus on iron because it is prominent in
    solar spectra. These particular ions were chosen because they are important for
    analyzing observations by the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode and by the
    Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntTSR
    began operation in 1988. It is the only storage ring in the world currently capable
    of performing the proposed measurements. However, it will be shut down at the end
    of 2012. The work proposed here thus represents the last opportunity to obtain these
    unambiguous EII data for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntIn the remainder
    of this section we discuss in more detail the motivation behind the proposed research
    and how our work will address the needs of the solar physics community. Section
    2 reviews the EII and DR processes and the state of experimental and theoretical
    knowledge. A description of TSR and the experimental techniques used is given in
    Sec. 4. Section 5 presents the results of our expiring SR grant NNX09AB25G. Finally
    in Sec. 6 we lay out our research plan for the three years of this proposal.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntN/A&lt;/p&gt;rn",nt"license_title":

    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
