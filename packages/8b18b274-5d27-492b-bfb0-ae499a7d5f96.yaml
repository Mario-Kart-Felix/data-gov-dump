    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Robotic planetary exploration missions will
    need to perform in-situ analysis of rock and/or regolith samples or returning samples
    back to earth. Obtaining and delivering a sample can be a complex engineering problem,
    especially if it's done autonomously thousands of miles away. To accommodate future
    missions, these subsurface access and sample handling technologies must be developed
    to meet a broad range of potential requirements, including a variety of rock or
    subsurface materials, rigorous sample preservation requirements, and the general
    problem of autonomous operation in the presence of dust and with limited resources.
    The one-to-three meter range has been identified as a critical regime for planetary
    exploration and while there has been some technology development in this regime,
    there is currently no proven flight-like approach to robotically achieving this
    depth through layers of challenging material from realistic roving or landed platforms.
    rnThe Phase 1 research has resulted in proving the benefits of rotary-percussive
    drilling system as it pertains to breaking of formation and cuttings transport.
    rnThe primary objective of the proposed effort is to develop, via testing in a simulated
    Mars environment, a breadboard one-meter sampling drilling system for acquiring
    a small volume of drilled cuttings and a core (if necessary) from a target depth
    on Mars. This project would build on the existing knowledge base of Mars drilling,
    and its particular strength lies with its capability of performing drilling tests
    under simulated Martian conditions of temperature and pressure and CO2 atmosphere.rnrnThis
    is a component technology effort that includes the development of a rotary percussive
    drill head and a sampling lead drill string. Honeybee Robotics will leverage drill
    head development by utilizing voice coil percussive actuator technology developed
    by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for the Mars Science Laboratory Powder Drill.rnrnrn",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
