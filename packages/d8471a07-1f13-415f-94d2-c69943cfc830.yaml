  high likelihood of acting as fluid flow conduits (Sibson, 1994). As such, the tendency
  of a fault segment to slip (slip tendency; Ts; Morris et al., 1996) or to dilate
  (dilation tendency; Td; Ferrill et al., 1999) provides an indication of which faults
  or fault segments within a geothermal system are critically stressed and therefore
  likely to transmit geothermal fluids. The slip tendency of a surface is defined
  by the ratio of shear stress to normal stress on that surface:nTs = u03c4 / u03c3n
  t(Morris et al., 1996).nDilation tendency is defined by the stress acting normal
  to a given surface:nTd = (u03c31-u03c3n) / (u03c31-u03c33) t(Ferrill et al., 1999).
  nSlip and dilation were calculated using 3DStress (Southwest Research Institute).nSlip
  and dilation tendency are both unitless ratios of the resolved stresses applied
  to the fault plane by ambient stress conditions. Values range from a maximum of
  1, a fault plane ideally oriented to slip or dilate under ambient stress conditions
  to zero, a fault plane with no potential to slip or dilate. Slip and dilation tendency
  values were calculated for each fault in the focus study areas at, McGinness Hills,
  Neal Hot Springs, Patua, Salt Wells, San Emidio, and Tuscarora on fault traces.
  As dip is not well constrained or unknown for many faults mapped in within these
  we made these calculations using the dip for each fault that would yield the maximum
  slip tendency or dilation tendency. As such, these results should be viewed as maximum
  tendency of each fault to slip or dilate. The resulting along-fault and fault-to-fault
  variation in slip or dilation potential is a proxy for along fault and fault-to-fault
  variation in fluid flow conduit potential.nStress Magnitudes and directionsnStress
  field variation within each focus area was approximated based on regional published
  data and the world stress database (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait
  et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2010; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and
  Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012; Moeck et al., 2010; Moos and Ronne, 2010
  and Reinecker et al., 2005) as well as local stress information if applicable. For
  faults within these focus systems we applied either a normal faulting stress regime
  where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax)
  which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin) or strike-slip
  faulting stress regime where the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) is larger than
  the vertical stress (sv) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (shmax
  >sv>shmin) depending on the general tectonic province of the system. Based on visual
  inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin we used magnitudes
  such that shmin/shmax = .527 and shmin/sv= .46, which are consistent with complete
  and partial stress field determinations from Desert Peak, Coso, the Fallon area
  and Dixie valley (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al.,
  2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2011; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes
  2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012). nnSlip and dilation tendency analysis for the Patua
  geothermal system was calculated based on faults mapped in the Hazen Quadrangle
  (Faulds et al., 2011). Patua lies near the margin between the Basin and Range province,
  which is characterized by west-northwest directed extension and the Walker Lane
  province, characterized by west-northwest directed dextral shear. As such, the Patua
  area likely has been affected by tectonic stress associated with either or both
  of stress regimes over geologic time. In order to characterize this stress variation
  we calculated slip tendency at Patua for both normal faulting and strike slip faulting
  stress regimes. Based on examination of regional and local stress data (as explained
  above) we applied at shmin direction of 105 to Patua. Whether the vertical stress
  (sv) magnitude is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) a normal faulting
  stress regime or the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) magnitude is larger than
  the vertical stress (sv), a strike-slip faulting stress regime, has very little
  effect on the dilation tendency, which is controlled by the stresses acting normal
  to fault planes. As such the dilation tendency results for a strike-slip faulting
  stress regime and for a normal faulting stress regime are virtually identical, so
  we present one result for dilation tendency applicable to both strike-slip and normal
  faulting stress conditions along with slip tendency for both a normal faulting and
  a strike-slip faulting stress regime. Under these stress conditions, north-northeast
  striking steeply dipping fault segments have the highest dilation tendency. Under
  the strike-slip faulting stress regime, north-northwest and east-northeast striking,
  steeply dipping fault have the highest slip tendency, while under normal faulting
  conditions north northeast striking, 60u00b0 dipping faults have the highest slip
  tendency.\",\n\t\t\"format\": \"ZIP\",\n\t\t\"tracking_summary\": {\n\t\t\t\"total\":
