	"notes": "&lt;p&gt;Development of the key antenna technologies for Tri-band (Ku\/Ka\/W), scanning precipitation and cloud radar is a required milestone in preparation for one or more missions in the upcoming decadal survey (namely the expected evolution of the Aerosol\/Clouds\/Ecosystems (ACE) concept and the Global Cloud and Precipitation Measurement (GPCM) mission concept in early formulation by a joint NASA and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency JAXA. Previously, cloud radars such as CloudSat (W-band) have been separated from precipitation radars such as TRMM (Ku Band) and GPM (Ku\/Ka Band): the overwhelming scientific consensus is that a next-generation mission will have to address the entire cloud-precipitation process in order to enable significant improvements in weather and climate models. In order to achieve that, scanning, high sensitivity and high range resolution, and high Doppler accuracy are necessary at a set of frequencies capable of detecting all tropospheric cloud and precipitation configurations from cirrus to deep convection: vast experimental evidence shows that this set of frequencies is the union of the GPM (Ku\/Ka) and CloudSat (W) bands. Polarimetric capability is also necessary to achieve high Doppler accuracy and detection of mixed phase layers and multiple scattering conditions. The proposed work addresses NASA strategic goals 2.1 and 3 by contributing to the development of an instrument capable of measuring both clouds and precipitation; this will aid the understanding of Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate and environment and will also contribute to innovative technologies to improve the future capabilities of NASA. The need for a single radar capable of addressing both aspects is exemplified by the sub-optimal solution adopted by necessity for the Global Precipitation Measurement radar (Launched in Feb-2014): instead of an actual dual-frequency radar, two single-frequency radars had to be placed next to each other, with significant impact on mission requirements and cost.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;The technology development component of this project focuses on two things: first, recent advances in high power electronics allow for higher radiated power with higher efficiencies than ever before. Second, advances in packaging technologies allow us to place more of these electronics closer together and therefore reduce considerably the size of the instrument capable of radiating the necessary amount of energy in the 3 frequencies. The tradeoff for this size reduction and high level of integration come at the cost of higher dissipated power per volume. One of the key elements of this work is thermal study that will determine is such packed integration is feasible while not overheating the electronics of the instrument.&lt;\/p&gt;",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
