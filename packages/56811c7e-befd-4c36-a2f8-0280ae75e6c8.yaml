  Ranging (LiDAR) survey project was a collaborative effort to develop detailed high
  density LiDAR terrain data for the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The LiDAR
  will be used to support hydraulic modeling work associated with proposed 2014 Columbia
  River treaty negotiations. The dataset encompasses approximately 2836 square miles
  of territory in portions of Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana within the Columbia
  River drainage. This survey was under the jurisdiction of three Corps districts:
  Portland (CENWP), Seattle (CENWS), and Walla Walla (CENWW). CENWP was the project
  lead and primary contracting organization. Bare earth point data are classified
  as either ground (2), model key point (8) or water (9) and represent the earth's
  surface with all vegetation and human-made structures removed. Model key points
  were generated to represent the bare earth surface within a 0.07 m tolerance. Ground
  points (class 2) are the remaining ground points not classed as model key. Both
  ground and model key classes are needed for display of all bare earth points. Water
  classification was used for those bare earth/ground classified points that fell
  inside a water boundary as determined using softcopy photogrammetry with stereograms
  generated from LiDAR intensities. All remaining points received the default classification
  (1). In some areas of heavy vegetation or forest cover, there may be relatively
  few ground points in the LiDAR data. The RMSE of the data for open, hard-packed
  surfaces is 0.046 meters as assessed from 40,266 ground survey (real time kinematic)
  points taken on hard-packed road surfaces. This value is representative of anticipated
  accuracies in open, evenly sloped or flat terrain where maximum point densities
  were achieved. The project was completed for the US Army Corps of Engineers, Portland
  District, to support hydraulic modeling related to the ACOE Columbia River Treaty
  project. Data acquisition, bare earth processing, and development of final tiled
  LiDAR deliverables and DEM's was performed by Watershed Sciences, Inc. Overall project
  management, photogrammetric quality control review using LiDAR stereograms, water
  delineation and breakline development was performed by David C. Smith & Associates,
  Inc. Professional Surveyor oversight of ground control data, ground control data
  processing and ground control publication was performed by David Evans and Associates,
  Inc. Final quality control review in ArcGIS of all final deliverables, including
  preparation of point density rasters and reach based geo-databases incorporating
  all deliverables, was performed by CC Patterson and Associates. NOTE ON DATUM ISSUES:
  All ground control and subsequent LiDAR data deliverables were developed and delivered
  at NAD '83 CORS 96 horizontal and NAVD '88 Geoid '09 vertical datums as processed
  in OPUS-DB. Due to limitations in the transformations supported by ESRI, NAD '83
  and NAVD '88 datums were temporarily assigned to the ESRI deliverables and ESRI
  .prj file even though the actual coordinate values in the data files are at the
  original NAD '83 CORS 96 and NAVD '88 Geoid '09 datums. In many instances, a temporary
  assignment of NAD '83 HARN or HPGN may better approximate local conditions. Plain
  NAD '83 was used for the primary deliverable in order to avoid any implication of
  higher precision; however, the user may want to evaluate other approximations for
  specific applications. At such time as ESRI includes support for NAD '83 CORS '96,
  the temporary NAD '83 assignment in the .prj file should be replaced with NAD '83
  CORS '96 without further reprojection. The NOAA Coastal Services Center has converted
  the data to ellipsoid heights (using Geoid09) and NAD 83 geographic coordinates
  for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819\",\n\t\"extras\":
