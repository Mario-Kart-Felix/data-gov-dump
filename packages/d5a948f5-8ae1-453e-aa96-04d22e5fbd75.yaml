    geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore of Monterey map area, California. The
    vector data file is included in "Geology_OffshoreMonterey.zip," which is accessible
    from http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7F47M6T. The offshore part of the Offshore of Monterey
    map area contains two geomorphic regionsu2014(1) the continental shelf, and (2)
    Carmel Canyon and its tributaries (part of the u201cOffshore Monterey systemu201d
    of Greene and others (2002)). The relatively flat continental shelf in the Offshore
    of Monterey map area consists of exposed bedrock or bedrock overlain by only a thin
    (< 5 m) cover of sediment). The thickest sediment in the map area (about 16 m) occurs
    in a broad depression about 2 km north of the north tip of the Monterey Peninsula
    at water depths of about 75 to 85 m (sheet 9, Map B). Inner- to mid-shelf and nearshore
    deposits are mostly sand (unit Qms), with coarse sand and gravel (unit Qmsc) present
    in the mid-shelf about 2 km offshore of Seaside. Unit Qmsf lies offshore of unit
    Qms in the mid to outer shelf (water depths of 65 to 150 m), consists primarily
    of mud and muddy sand, and is commonly extensively bioturbated. Unit Qmsd typically
    is mapped as erosional lags in scour depressions that are bounded by relatively
    sharp or, less commonly, diffuse contacts with the horizontal sand sheets of unit
    Qms. These depressions typically are irregular to lenticular and a few tens of centimeters
    deep, and they range in size from a few tens of square meters to as much as 2,400,000
    m2. They most commonly are found at water depths that range from about 15 to 90
    m. Such scour depressions are common along this stretch of the California coast
    (see, for example, Cacchione and others, 1984; Hallenbeck and others, 2012; Davis
    and others, 2013), where offshore sandy sediment can be relatively thin (and, thus,
    is unable to fill the depressions) owing to low sediment supply from rivers and
    also to significant erosion and offshore transport of sediment during large northwest
    winter swells. Such features have been referred to as u201crippled scour depressionsu201d
    (see, for example, Cacchione and others, 1984) or u201csorted bedformsu201d (see,
    for example, Goff and others, 2005; Trembanis and Hume, 2011). Although the general
    areas in which both unit Qmsd scour depressions and surrounding Qms sand sheets
    are found are not likely to change substantially, the boundaries of the unit(s)
    likely are ephemeral, changing seasonally and during significant storm events. Sea
    level has risen about 125 to 130 m over about the last 21,000 years (for example,
    Stanford and others, 2011), leading to broadening of the continental shelf, progressive
    eastward migration of the shoreline, and associated transgressive erosion and deposition.
    A submerged shoreline along the flank of Carmel Canyon (water depths of 80 to 90
    m) represents a relative sea-level stillstand, indicating that sea-level rise was
    not steady. Associated map units include a wave-cut platform (unit Qwp) and an adjacent
    riser (unit Qwpr). Bedrock units forming seafloor outcrops on the shelf include
    Cretaceous granitic rocks (unit Kgr), the Paleocene Carmelo Formation (unit Tc;
    Bowen, 1965), Oligocene volcanic rocks (basaltic andesite, unit Tvb), the Miocene
    Monterey Formation (unit Tm), the upper Miocene and Pliocene Purisima Formation
    (unit Tp) (Eittreim and others, 2002; Wagner and others, 2002). Unit Tu is mapped
    where rocks of the Carmelo, Monterey, and Purisima Formations cannot be confidently
    divided. Unit Kgr is notably characterized by high backscatter (sheet 3) and rough,
    massive, and fractured seafloor texture. In contrast the less indurated Neogene
    sedimentary rocks, most notably units Tm and Tp, form lower relief outcrops with
    common u201cribbedu201d morphology reflecting the differential hardness (and hence
    erodibility) of sedimentary layers. Several of these bedrock units are in places
    overlain by a thin (less than 1 m?) veneer of sediment recognized on the basis of
    high backscatter, flat relief, continuity with moderate- to higher-relief outcrops,
    and (in some cases) high-resolution seismic-reflection data; these areas, which
    are mapped as composite units (for example, Qms/Kgr or Qms/Tp) are interpreted as
    ephemeral sediment layers that may or may not be continuously present, depending
    on storms, seasonal and (or) annual patterns of sediment movement, or longer term
    climate cycles. The shelf north and east of the Monterey Bay Peninsula in the Offshore
    of Monterey map area is cut by a diffuse zone of northwest striking, steeply dipping
    to vertical faults comprising the Monterey Bay Fault Zone (MBFZ). This zone, originally
    mapped by Greene (1977, 1990), extends about 45 km across Monterey Bay (Map E on
    sheet 9). Fault strands within the MBFZ are mapped with high-resolution seismic-reflection
    profiles (sheet 8). Seismic-reflection profiles traversing this diffuse zone in
    the map area cross as many as 5 faults over a width of about 4 to 5 km (see, for
    example, figs. 3 and 5 on sheet 8). The zone lacks a continuous u201cmaster fault,u201d
    along which deformation is concentrated. Fault length ranges up to about 20 km (based
    on mapping outside this map area), but most strands are only about 2- to 7-km long.
    Faults in this diffuse zone cut through Neogene bedrock and locally appear to minimally
    disrupt overlying inferred Quaternary sediments. The presence of warped reflections
    along some fault strands suggests that fault offsets may be both vertical and strike-slip.
    Specific offshore faults within the zone that are continuous with mapped onshore
    faults include the Navy Fault, Chupines Fault, and Ord Terrace Fault (Clark and
    others, 1997; Wagner and others, 2002). Carmel Canyon, a relatively straight northwest-trending
    arm of the Offshore Monterey system, extends through the southwestern part of the
    Offshore of Monterey map area. Carmel Canyon has three heads (Greene and others,
    2002), two of which extend east and northeast into Carmel Bay within the map area;
    the third head extends southeast along the main canyon trend for about 3 km beyond
    the confluence with the heads in Carmel Bay. Sandy canyon-head channel deposits
    (unit Qchc) are mapped at the head of the northeast-trending arm of Carmel Canyon
    in Carmel Bay. Active Carmel Canyon channel fill is mapped as three distinct units:
    unit Qcpcf, characterized by sand crescentic bedforms, is mapped in upper Carmel
    Canyon; unit Qccf1 is mapped in curvilinear tributaries on the north and east flanks
    of Carmel Canyon and consists of gravel with minor bedrock and landslides; unit
    Qccf2 is mapped in primary Carmel Canyon channels, consists of sand and gravel that
    locally forms crescentic bedforms, and includes small bedrock outcrops and landslides.
    Sand and mud deposited on a bench immediately adjacent to Carmel Canyonu2019s axial
    channel is mapped as unit Qcb; this unit is present in only a small part of the
    map area but is more widespread in Offshore Monterey (Maier and others, 2016) and
    is more extensive in Carmel Canyon south of this map area. Carmel Canyon walls that
    are relatively smooth are generally covered by muddy Quaternary sediments (unit
    Qcw), whereas steeper and rougher segments of canyon walls commonly contain exposures
    of bedrock. Purisima Formation outcrops occur in the upper canyon walls (unit Tpcw)
    in the northwestern part of the map area. Older, underlying bedrock is exposed at
    greater depths along canyon walls (Greene, 1977; Greene and others, 1991; Wong and
    Eittreim, 2002). These older units include the Miocene Monterey Formation (unit
    Tmcw) and Cretaceous granodiorite (unit Kgcw). The relatively smooth and flat area
    in the southwest corner of the map area forms a bathymetric divide between Carmel
    Canyon to the east and Point Lobos Canyon to the west and is inferred to be covered
    by mud with minimal sand (unit Qmscp). Carmel Canyon is aligned with and structurally
    controlled by the San Gregorio fault zone (Greene and others, 1991), an important
    structure in the distributed transform boundary between the North American and Pacific
    plates (see, for example, Dickinson and others, 2005). This fault zone is part of
    a regional fault system that is present predominantly in the offshore for about
    400 km, from Point Conception in the south (where it is known as the Hosgri Fault;
    Johnson and Watt, 2012) to Bolinas and Point Reyes in the north (Bruns and others,
    2002; Ryan and others, 2008). The San Gregorio Fault Zone in the map area is part
    of a 90-km-long offshore segment that extends northward from Point Sur (about 24
    km south of the map area), across outer Monterey Bay to Point Au00f1o Nuevo (51
    km north of the map area) (see sheet 9; see also, Weber and Lajoie, 1980; Brabb
    and others, 1998; Wagner and others, 2002). High-resolution seismic-reflection data
    collected across the canyon do not clearly image the San Gregorio Fault Zone, due
    largely to significant depth and steep canyon walls. Accordingly, we have mapped
    the 1,000- 1,300-m-wide fault zone largely on the presence of prominent, lengthy,
    geomorphic lineaments (sheets 1 and 2) and both geomorphic and lithologic contrasts
    across the fault. Following Greene and others (2002), we note that relatively straight-sloping
    drainage channels and slumps lightly dissect the eastern canyon wall, which is underlain
    by unit Kgcw. In contrast, the western wall of Carmel Canyon is composed of steep
    cliffs and underlain by a mix of the Miocene Monterey Formation (unit Tmcw) and
    Cretaceous sedimentary rocks (Greene, 1977; Greene and others, 1991; Eittreim and
    others, 2002; Wong and Eittreim, 2002). Map unit polygons were digitized over underlying
    2-m- and 5-m-resolution base layers developed from multibeam bathymetry and backscatter
    data (see "Bathymetry--Offshore of Santa Cruz Map Area, California" and "Backscatter--Offshore
    of Santa Cruz Map Area, California"). The bathymetry and backscatter data were
    collected between 2006 and 2010. References Cited: Bruns, T.R., Cooper, A.K., Carlson,
