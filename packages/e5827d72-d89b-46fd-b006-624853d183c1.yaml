  networking, the amount of generated textrndata has seen a sharp increase. In order
  to handle such a huge volume of text data, new and improved text mining techniques
  are a necessity. One of the characteristics of text data that makes text mining
  difficult, is multi-labelity. In order to build a robust and effective text classification
  method which is an integral part of text mining research, we must consider this
  property more closely. This kind of property is not unique to text data as it can
  be found in non-text (e.g., numeric) data as well. However, in text data, it is
  most prevalent. This property also puts the text classification problem in the domain
  of multi-label classification (MLC), where each instancernis associated with a subset
  of class-labels instead of a single class, as in conventional classification. In
  this paper, we explore how the generation of pseudo labels (i.e., combinations of
  existing class labels) can help us in performing better text classification and
  under what kind of circumstances. During the classification, the high and sparse
  dimensionality of text data has also been considered. Although, here we are proposing
  and evaluating a text classification technique, our main focus is on the handling
  of the multi-labelity of text data while utilizing the correlation among multiple
  labels existing in the data set. Our text classification technique is called pseudo-LSC
  (pseudo-Label Based Subspace Clustering). It is a subspace clustering algorithm
  that considers the high and sparse dimensionality as well as the correlation among
  different class labels during the classification process to provide better performance
  than existing approaches. Results on three real world multi-label data sets provide
  us insight into how the multi-labelity is handled in our classification process
  and shows the effectiveness of our approach.\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S. Government

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
