    and quickly diagnose faults that may occur in different technical systems on-board
    a vehicle will play a key role in the success of future NASA missions. We discuss
    in this paper the diagnosis of abrupt continuous (or parametric) faults within the
    context of probabilistic graphical models, more specifically Bayesian networks that
    are compiled to arithmetic circuits. This paper extends our previous research, within
    the same probabilistic setting, on diagnosis of abrupt discrete faults. Our approach
    and diagnostic algorithm ProDiagnose are domain-independent; however we use an electrical
    power system testbed called ADAPT as a case study. In one set of ADAPT experiments,
    performed as part of the 2009 Diagnostic Challenge, our system turned out to have
    the best performance among all competitors. In a second set of experiments, we show
    how we have recently further significantly improved the performance of the probabilistic
    model of ADAPT. While these experiments are obtained for an electrical power system
    testbed, we believe they can easily be transitioned to real-world systems, thus
    promising to increase the success of future NASA missions.rnrn**Reference:**rnrnB.

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
