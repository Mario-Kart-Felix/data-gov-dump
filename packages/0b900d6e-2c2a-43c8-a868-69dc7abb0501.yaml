    census population data to a latitude-longitude grid so that population data may
    be used in cross-disciplinary studies. There are three data files with this data
    set for the reference years 1990 and 1995. Over 127,000 administrative units and
    population counts were collected and integrated from various sources to create the
    gridded data. In brief, GPW was created using the following steps:    * Population
    data were estimated for the product reference years, 1990 and 1995, either by the
    data source or by interpolating or extrapolating the given estimates for other years.
       * Additional population estimates were created by adjusting the source population
    data to match UN national population estimates for the reference years.    * Borders
    and coastlines of the spatial data were matched to the Digital Chart of the World
    where appropriate and lakes from the Digital Chart of the World were added.    *
    The resulting data were then transformed into grids of UN-adjusted and unadjusted
    population counts for the reference years.    * Grids containing the area of administrative
    boundary data in each cell (net of lakes) were created and used with the count grids
    to produce population densities.As with any global data set based on multiple data
    sources, the spatial and attribute precision of GPW is variable. The level of detail
    and accuracy, both in time and space, vary among the countries for which data were
    obtained.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
