    NASA Stennis Space Centerrnrn**Abstract**rnrnThe goal of this work was to use data-driven
    methods to automatically detect and isolate faults in the J-2X rocket engine. It
    was decided to use decision trees, since they tend to be easier to interpret than
    other data-driven methods. The decision tree algorithm automatically u201clearnsu201d
    a decision tree by performing a search through the space of possible decision trees
    to find one that fits the training data. The particular decision tree algorithm
    used is known as C4.5. Simulated J-2X data from a high-fidelity simulator developed
    at Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne and known as the Detailed Real-Time Model (DRTM) was
    used to u201ctrainu201d and test the decision tree. Fifty-six DRTM simulations were
    performed for this purpose, with different leak sizes, different leak locations,
    and different times of leak onset. To make the simulations as realistic as possible,
    they included simulated sensor noise, and included a gradual degradation in both
    fuel and oxidizer turbine efficiency. A decision tree was trained using 11 of these
    simulations, and tested using the remaining 45 simulations. In the training phase,
    the C4.5 algorithm was provided with labeled examples of data from nominal operation
    and data including leaks in each leak location. From the data, it u201clearnedu201d
    a decision tree that can classify unseen data as having no leak or having a leak
    in one of the five leak locations. In the test phase, the decision tree produced
    very low false alarm rates and low missed detection rates on the unseen data. It
    had very good fault isolation rates for three of the five simulated leak locations,
    but it tended to confuse the remaining two locations, perhaps because a large leak
    at one of these two locations can look very similar to a small leak at the other
    location.rnrn**Introduction**rnrnThe J-2X rocket engine will be tested on Test Stand
    A-1 at NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC) in Mississippi. A team including people from
    SSC, NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) is developing
    a prototype end-to-end integrated systems health management (ISHM) system that will
    be used to monitor the test stand and the engine while the engine is on the test
    stand[1]. The prototype will use several different methods for detecting and diagnosing
    faults in the test stand and the engine, including rule-based, model-based, and
    data-driven approaches. SSC is currently using the G2 tool [http://www.gensym.com](http://www.gensym.com)
    to develop rule-based and model-based fault detection and diagnosis capabilities
    for the A-1 test stand. This paper describes preliminary results in applying the
    data-driven approach to detecting and diagnosing faults in the J-2X engine.rnThe
    conventional approach to detecting and diagnosing faults in complex engineered systems
    such as rocket engines and test stands is to use large numbers of human experts.
    Test controllers watch the data in near-real time during each engine test. Engineers
    study the data after each test. These experts are aided by limit checks that signal
    when a particular variable goes outside of a predetermined range. The conventional
    approach is very labor intensive. Also, humans may not be able to recognize faults
    that involve the relationships among large numbers of variables. Further, some potential
    faults could happen too quickly for humans to detect them and react before they
    become catastrophic. Automated fault detection and diagnosis is therefore needed.rnOne
    approach to automation is to encode human knowledge into rules or models. Another
    approach is use data-driven methods to automatically learn models from historical
    data or simulated data. Our prototype will combine the data-driven approach with
    the model-based and rule-based approaches. This paper focuses on the data-driven
    approach.rnrn**The J-2X Engine**rnrnThe J-2X is a rocket engine currently under
    development at Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne. It will be fueled by liquid hydrogen
    and liquid oxygen. It will be used as the second-stage engine on NASAu2019s Ares
    I crew launch vehicle [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/ares/aresl/](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/ares/aresl/)
    and Ares V cargo launch vehicle [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/ares/aresV/](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/ares/aresV/).
    It is derived from the J-2 engine, which served as the second- and third-stage engines
    on the Saturn V launch vehicle. The J-2X engine is shown in Figure 1.rn[http://www.pw.utc.com/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextrefresh=1&vgnextoid=8fd0586642738110VgnVCM100000c45a529fRCRD](http://www.pw.utc.com/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextrefresh=1&vgnextoid=8fd0586642738110VgnVCM100000c45a529fRCRD)rnrn**Test
    Stand A-1**rnrnSSC operates several rocket engine test stands. Each test stand provides
    a structure strong enough to hold a rocket engine in place as it is fired, and a
    fuel feed system to provide fuel to the engine. Test stand A-1 is a large test stand
    that is currently used to test the space shuttle's main engines, and will be used
    to test the J-2X. It can withstand a maximum dynamic load of 1.7 million pounds
    of force. It provides liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to the engine being tested,
    and has numerous sensors on its fuel feed system. Test Stand A-1 is shown in Figure
    2.rn[http://rockettest.nasa.gov/rptmb/ssc_a1_test_stand.asp](http://rockettest.nasa.gov/rptmb/ssc_a1_test_stand.asp)rnrn**The
    J-2X Detailed Real-Time Model**rnrnWe used data from a high-fidelity physics-based
    simulator to train and test the data-driven algorithms. The physics-based model
    chosen for this project is the J-2X Detailed Transient Model or DTM. The J-2X DTM,
    as the name indicates, is a transient model that accurately models all phases of
    engine operation including start, mainstage  (phase between start and shutdown),
    and shutdown. The J-2X DTM simulates processes describing rocket engine operation
    including heat transfer, fluid flow, combustion and valve dynamics. Flowrates, pump
    speeds, temperatures and pressures are modeled as time dependent differential equations
    that are updated at a high rate, typically 2000 Hz. Property tables, valve characteristics
    and turbomachinery efficiency and performance curves are also incorporated in the
    DTM. DTMu2019s are used to develop safe start and shutdown sequences and for anomaly
    resolution. The J-2X DTM builds on a long history of DTMu2019s supporting most major
    Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) rocket engines.rnThe J-2X DTM underwent modification
    to enable it to run in u201creal-timeu201d mode. In real-time mode, the DTM will
    respond in real world clock time to external stimuli such as changes in valve position
    and engine inlet conditions. The latter will comprise the interface to the test
    stand model. Advances in computer processor technology have made this possible due
    to the fast update rate required to maintain numeric stability. (Faster update rates
    imply smaller time steps, which result in smaller errors, which result in greater
    stability.)  Real-time performance is achieved if a model advances in time (step
    time) at the same rate as a wall clock. If a processor can perform all calculations
    in a step time or less, then the model is real-time capable. The step time should
    also be consistent and set to the longest measured step time corresponding to the
    longest logical path.  Shorter frames are then padded to provide a deterministic
    step time. The J-2X DTM, or any DTM for that matter, was not optimized for real-time
    operation. Changes that were required include streamlining model code, limiting
    or eliminating model diagnostic output, and fixing the step time. The J-2X DTM currently
    uses a variable step time to maintain numeric stability so deterministic timing
    is not possible. Real-time DTM operation is required when communication to other
    real-time components of a system is required such as hardware-in-the-loop testing
    or for online monitoring of an engine and test stand. Near real-time operation has
    been demonstrated indicating full real-time operation is feasible in the near future.
    The modified DTM now has the designation J-2X Detailed Real-Time Model or DRTM.rnThe
    DRTM was modified to enable failure mode simulation. Failure modes are modeled as
    changes to the flowpath of the DRTM (e.g. leaks) or modification of engine parameters
    (e.g. turbine efficiency) representative of failure signatures. Sensor characteristics,
    such as lag and bit toggle, and process noise were also modeled to better replicate
    engine operation.  A simulation of cavitation due to low inlet pressure was also
    added to the DRTM as the primary test stand/engine interface fault mode. As the
    inlet pressure falls below a certain level, the propellant begins to vaporize and
    pump performance drops dramatically.rnrn**Data-driven fault detection and diagnostics**rnrnIn
    our previous work[2,3] , we used unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms to automatically
    detect faults in Space Shuttle Main Engine data. Unsupervised anomaly detection
    algorithms are trained using only nominal data. They learn a model of the nominal
    data, and signal an anomaly when new data fails to match the model. They are useful
    when few examples of failure data are available. For a rocket such as the Space
    Shuttle Main Engine, very few examples of failures exist in the historical data.
    Unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms are therefore useful when using historical
    data as training data. For the J-2X, no real data is available yet, since the engine
    has not been built yet. However, we do have a high-fidelity physics-based simulator
    that can simulate faults. We therefore decided to use supervised learning. When
    used for fault detection and diagnostics, supervised learning algorithms take as
    input data from nominal operation and from each failure mode. They learn a model
    that is able to distinguish between the nominal data and the data for each fault
    mode. They are able to go beyond the capabilities of unsupervised anomaly detection
    algorithms by identifying the fault mode, rather than just detecting anomalies.rnWe
    decided to use a decision tree learning algorithm because the decision trees learned
    by these algorithms are much easier for human experts to interpret than the models
    produced by some competing algorithms such as neural networks or support vector
    machines. Having engineering experts examine the decision trees is very helpful
    for verifying them before deploying them. The decision tree algorithm automatically
    u201clearnsu201d a decision tree by performing a search through the space of possible
    decision trees to find one that fits the training data. The particular decision
    tree algorithm used is known as C4.5[4].rnrn**Results**rnrnIn the first experiment,
    two DRTM simulations were used to train a decision tree. The two simulations each
    had a leak at the same location, but the leaks were of two different sizes and started
    at two different times. The simulations included simulated sensor noise, and included
    a gradual degradation in both fuel and oxidizer turbine efficiency. The simulations
    also included all four modes, and lasted 500 seconds. The internal timestep was
    0.00005 seconds, and the timestep in the recorded data was 0.02 seconds. The resulting
    tree had 14 nodes. The tree decides whether or not there is a leak at the one location
    at which the leaks were simulated. Engineering experts on our team examined the
    tree and concluded that it makes sense.rnA third DRTM simulation was used to test
    the tree. This simulation had a leak at the same location but again with a different
    size and at a different time. When applied to this test set, the tree was 99.9957%
    accurate (meaning that 99.9957% of the time, the tree correctly identified whether
    there was or was not a leak), which is extremely high accuracy. Only one timestep
    was classified wrong.rnA second set of experiments was performed using 56 DRTM simulations
    as follows:rn* Five leak locationsrn* Eleven simulations for each leak location,
    with eleven different leak sizesrn* One simulation with no leakrn* Each simulation
    was 500 seconds, and the time at which the leak started ranged from 50 to 400 seconds.rnA
    C4.5 decision tree was trained using 11 of these simulations (two for each leak
    location plus one with no leak), and tested on the remaining 45 simulations. The
    resulting decision tree has 12,289 nodes, and is thus too big to be easily comprehended
    by humans. We can offer two possible explanations for the large number of nodes.
    The first explanation is that C4.5 is overfitting. This hypothesis is supported
    by the fact that the tree had a lower error rate on the training data than it did
    on the test data. The second explanation is that the decision function being learned
    cannot be represented using a decision tree with axis-parallel cuts; C4.5 therefore
    learns a "stairstep" function consisting of many nodes.rnrnThe decision tree decides
    whether there is no leak or a leak at a particular location (out of the five locations).
    Table 1 shows the false alarm rates for this decision tree. The false alarm rates
    in the table answer the following question: Of all the time steps that do not have
    a leak, for what percentage does the decision tree incorrectly report a leak in
    each location? The total false alarm rate of 0.0072% is considered to be very good.rnTable
    2 shows the missed detection rates for the same tree. The missed detection rates
    in the table answer the following question: Of all the time steps that have a leak
    of the given size at the given location, for what percentage of the time steps does
    the decision tree fail to detect the leak? It can be seen that at leak locations
    3 and 4, the tree performs very well for leaks of size 0.03 square inches or greater.
    For leaks at location 7, the tree performs well for leaks of size 0.05 square inches
    or greater. For leaks at location 9, the tree performs well for leaks of size 0.1
    square inches or greater. But for leaks at location 8, the tree does not do a good
    job of detecting the leak until the size of the leak reaches 0.22 square inches.
    This reflects the fact that leak location 8 produces the smallest leak rates for
    a given leak area.rnTable 3 shows the misisolation rate for the same tree. The misisolation
    rates in the table answer the following question: Out of all the time steps in which
    a leak of a particular size at a particular location occurs, how often is it misidentified
    as being at a different location? It can be seen that the decision tree does a good
    job of isolating leaks of size 0.1 square inches or larger for locations 3, 4, and
    7, but not for locations 8 or 9. More light is shed on misisolation by the confusion
    matrix, which is shown in Table 4.rnrnThe confusion matrix answers the following
    question: When there is a leak at a particular location (or no leak), how often
    does the decision tree say that there is a leak at a particular location (the correct
    location or an incorrect location)? The first row is false alarms, the first column
    is missed detections, and the rest of the matrix is misidentifications (except for
    the diagonal). (Note: The confusion matrix and the false alarm rate table were calculated
    using only test data, while the missed detection matrix and misisolation matrix
    were calculated using both training and test data (in order to include every leak
    size in the set). Because of this difference, the first column of the confusion
    matrix does not equal the total missed detections in the missed detection matrix.)
    The matrix shows that locations 8 and 9 are often confused with each other, explaining
    the high misisolation rates for those two locations. A possible explanation for
    this confusion is that a small leak at location 8 could look like a large leak at
    location 9.rnrn**Conclusions**rnrnHigh-fidelity simulated J-2X data was used to
    train a decision tree for fault detection and fault isolation. Testing the tree
    on a separate set of simulated data showed that the tree has very low false alarm
    rates. It has very low missed detection rates for leaks of size 0.1 square inches
    or larger at four of the five locations, and adequate missed detection rates for
    leaks of size 0.2 square inches or larger at the fifth location. The tree almost
    always correctly isolates leaks of size 0.1 square inches or larger for three of
    the five locations, but tends to confuse the remaining two locations.rnThe decision
    tree described here was delivered to SSC for integration with G2 at Test Stand A-1.rnrn**References**rnrn[1]

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
