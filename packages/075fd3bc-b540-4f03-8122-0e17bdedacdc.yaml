    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Launch vehicles experience extreme acoustic
    loads during liftoff driven by the interaction of rocket plumes and plume-generated
    acoustic waves with ground structures. Currently employed predictive capabilities
    are too dissipative to accurately resolve the propagation of waves throughout the
    launch environment. Higher fidelity non-dissipative analysis tools are critically
    needed to design mitigation measures (such as water deluge) and launch pad geometry
    for current and future NASA and commercial launch vehicles. This project will develop
    and deliver breakthrough technologies to drastically improve acoustic loads predictions.
    An innovative hybrid CFD and Computational Aeroacoustics (CFD/CAA) method will be
    developed where established RANS/LES modeling will be used for predicting the acoustic
    generation physics, and a high-order accurate unstructured discontinuous Galerkin
    (DG) method will be employed to propagate acoustic waves across large distances
    using ideally suited high-order accurate schemes. This new paradigm enables: (1)
    Improved fidelity over linear methods; (2) Greatly reduced numerical dissipation
    and dispersion; and (3) Improved acoustics modeling for attenuation, diffraction,
    and reflection from complex geometry. A proof-of-concept was developed and successfully
    demonstrated during Phase I for benchmark applications as well as SLS prototype
    model launch environments. Phase II will deliver production CFD/CAA predictive capabilities
    with 4th-order spatial and temporal accuracy for near lossless acoustic propagation
    throughout the launch environment, which will provide NASA engineers with more than
    a two-fold increase in the range of resolvable frequencies over current methods.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
