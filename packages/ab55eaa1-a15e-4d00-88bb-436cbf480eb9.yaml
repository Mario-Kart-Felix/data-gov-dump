  and associated trend count data were obtained from the 2013 Nevada Sage-grouse Lek
  Database compiled by the Nevada Department of Wildlife (NDOW, S. Espinosa, 9/10/2013).
  We queried the database for leks with a u00e2u0080u0098LEKSTATUSu00e2u0080u0099
  field classified as u00e2u0080u0098Activeu00e2u0080u0099 or u00e2u0080u0098Pendingu00e2u0080u0099.
  Active leks comprised leks with breeding males observed within the last 5 years.
  Pending leks comprised leks without consistent breeding activity during the prior
  3 u00e2u0080u0093 5 surveys or had not been surveyed during the past 5 years; these
  leks typically trended towards u00e2u0080u0098inactiveu00e2u0080u0099. A sage-grouse
  management area (SGMA) was calculated by buffering Population Management Units developed
  by NDOW by 10km. This included leks from the Buffalo-Skedaddle PMU that straddles
  the northeastern California u00e2u0080u0093 Nevada border, but excluded leks for
  the Bi-State Distinct Population Segment. The 5-year average (2009 u00e2u0080u0093
  2013) for the number of males grouse (or unknown gender if males were not identified)
  attending each lek was calculated. The final dataset comprised 907 leks. Utilization
  distributions describing the probability of lek occurrence were calculated using
  fixed kernel density estimators (Silverman 1986) with bandwidths estimated from
  likelihood based cross-validation (CVh) (Horne and Garton 2006). UDs were weighted
  by the 5-year average (2009 u00e2u0080u0093 2013) for the number of males grouse
  (or unknown gender if males were not identified) attending leks. UDs and bandwidths
  were calculated using Geospatial Modelling Environment (Beyer 2012) and the u00e2u0080u0098ksu00e2u0080u0099
  package (Duong 2012) in Program R. Grid cell size was 30m. The resulting raster
  was clipped by the SGMA polygon, and values were re-scaled between zero and one
  by dividing by the maximum pixel value.The non-linear effect of distance to lek
  on the probability of grouse spatial use was estimated using the inverse of the
  utilization distribution curves described by Coates et al. (2013), where essentially
  the highest probability of grouse spatial use occurs near leks and then declines
  precipitously as a non-linear function. Euclidean distance was first calculated
  in ArcGIS, reclassified into 30-m distance bins (ranging from 0 u00e2u0080u0093
  30,000m), and bins reclassified according to the non-linear curve in Coates et al.
  (2013). The resulting raster was clipped by the SGMA polygon, and re-scaled between
  zero and one by dividing by the maximum pixel value.A Spatial Use Index (SUI) was
  calculated taking the average of the lek utilization distribution and non-linear
  distance to lek rasters in ArcGIS, and re-scaled between zero and 1 by dividing
  by the maximum pixel value.The volume of the SUI at cumulative 5% increments (isopleths)
  was extracted in Geospatial Modelling Environment (Beyer 2012) with the command
  u00e2u0080u0098isoplethu00e2u0080u0099. Interior polygons (i.e., donutsu00e2u0080u0099
  &gt; 1.2 km2) representing no probability of use within a larger polygon of use
  were erased from each isopleth. The relationship between percent land area within
  each isopleth and isopleth volume (VanderWal and Rodgers 2012) indicated statistically
  concentrated use at the 70% isopleth. The 85% isopleth, which provided greater spatial
  connectivity and consistency with previously used agency standards (e.g., Doherty
  et al. 2010), was ultimately recommended by the Sagebrush Ecosystem Technical Team.
  The 85% SUI isopleth was clipped by the SGMA clipped by the Nevada state boundary,
  which only included habitat within the state of Nevada.Coates, P.S., Casazza, M.L.,
