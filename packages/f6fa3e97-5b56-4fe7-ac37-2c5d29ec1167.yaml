    null,nt"notes": "The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files
    (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from
    the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
    Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless
    national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File
    is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to
    cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block
    delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract
    that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same
    decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,..,
    3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract.
    Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum
    size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census
    Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated
    BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census
    Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous
    area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered
    within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never
    cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic
    entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional
    districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have
    a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water
    area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and
    Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary
    into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau
    delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The
    Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore,
    water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.<br /><br
    /> This table contains data on employment and participation of mothers in the labor
    force from the American Community Survey 2006-2010 database for block groups. The
    American Community Survey (ACS) is a household survey conducted by the U.S. Census
    Bureau that currently has an annual sample size of about 3.5 million addresses.
    ACS estimates provides communities with the current information they need to plan
    investments and services. Information from the survey generates estimates that help
    determine how more than $400 billion in federal and state funds are distributed
    annually. Each year the survey produces data that cover the periods of 1-year, 3-year,
    and 5-year estimates for geographic areas in the United States and Puerto Rico,
    ranging from neighborhoods to Congressional districts to the entire nation. This
    table also has a companion table (Same table name with MOE Suffix) with the margin
    of error (MOE) values for each estimated element. MOE is expressed as a measure
    value for each estimated element. So a value of 25 and an MOE of 5 means 25 +/-
    5 (or statistical certainty between 20 and 30). There are also special cases of
    MOE. An MOE of -1 means the associated estimates do not have a measured error. An
    MOE of 0 means that error calculation is not appropriate for the associated value.
    An MOE of 109 is set whenever an estimate value is 0. The MOEs of aggregated elements
    and percentages must be calculated. This process means using standard error calculations
    as described in "American Community Survey Multiyear Accuracy of the Data (3-year
    2008-2010 and 5-year 2006-2010)". Also, following Census guidelines, aggregated
    MOEs do not use more than 1 0-element MOE (109) to prevent over estimation of the
    error. Due to the complexity of the calculations, some percentage MOEs cannot be
    calculated (these are set to null in the summary-level MOE tables).<br /><br />
    The name for table 'ACS10EMPBGMOE' was added as a prefix to all field names imported
    from that table. Be sure to turn off 'Show Field Aliases' to see complete field
    names in the Attribute Table of this feature layer. This can be done in the 'Table
    Options' drop-down menu in the Attribute Table or with key sequence '[CTRL]+[SHIFT]+N'.
    Due to database restrictions, the prefix may have been abbreviated if the field
    name exceded the maximum allowed characters.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
