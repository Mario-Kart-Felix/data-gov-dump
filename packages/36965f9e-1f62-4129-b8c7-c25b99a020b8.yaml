    and prey items were collected from six colonies on the Columbia and Willamette rivers
    and Puget Sound during 1994-95. Contaminant concentrations, reproductive success,
    and biomagnification factors (BMFs) were determined and effects of residue levels
    were measured by H4IIE rat hepatoma and ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (EROD) bioassays.
    Fledging and reproductive rates were similar to those determined for other healthy
    heron populations. With the exception of one site, mean residue concentrations in
    heron eggs and prey were low. However, elevated concentrations of PCBs were detected
    in eggs and prey from Ross Island on the Willamette River. Among-site differences
    were not statistically significant different in H4IIE TCDD-equivalents (TCDD-EQs)
    or EROD activity, although the TCDD-EQ for Karlson Island was 9 to 20 times greater
    than that of any other site. Large differences existed between toxic equivalents
    calculated from egg residue concentrations and TCDDEQs, which indicated non-additive
    interactions among the compounds. TCDD-EQs and nest failure were positively correlated
    with TCDD concentration. Biomagnification factors varied greatly among sites for
    most compounds. Of the organochlorine pesticides, DDE and heptachlor epoxide were
    magnified the most. Penta- and hexachlorinated dioxins were biomagnified to a greater
    extent than TCDD. Our results support the use of great blue herons as an indicator
    of contamination in aquatic ecosystems. Their relatively low sensitivity to organochlorine
    contaminants and high trophic position allows contaminant accumulation and biomagnification
    without immediate adverse effects which are often seen in other, more sensitive
    species. Breeding behavior of great blue herons was also examined at the six colonies
    to Patterns of brooding, pair bonding, preening, and nest visits were significantly
    different (P < 0.05) between the reference and non-reference sites. The site with
    the highest concentrations of DDE and PCBs had significantly lower nest attendance
    and feeding rates relative to the reference site. Differences in nest attendance
    among colonies were inversely correlated with DDE concentrations (r = -0.79, P =
    0.06). Among-site differences in the odds ratios for adults feeding chicks were
    positively correlated with DDE and PCB concentrations (r = 0.84, P = 0.04 and r
    = 0.79, P = 0.06 respectively), but these relationships may be an artifact of the
    low frequency of occurrence of feeding sessions and its dependence on nest attendance.
    Clutch size and hatch, fledge, and reproductive success were similar to those reported
    for healthy populations. Differences in activity budgets among sites do not appear
    to be affecting reproductive rates of herons at the different colonies.",nt"license_title":
