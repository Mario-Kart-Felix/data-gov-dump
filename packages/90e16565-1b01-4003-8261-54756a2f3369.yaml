    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Astronauts suffer from poor dexterity of
    their hands due to the clumsy spacesuit gloves during Extravehicular Activity (EVA)
    operations and NASA has had a widely recognized but unmet need for novel human machine
    interface technologies to facilitate data entry, communications, and robots or intelligent
    systems control. The objective of this research project is to develop a speech human
    interface that can offer both crewmember usability and system operational efficiency.
    But loud noise and strong reverberation inside spacesuits make automatic speech
    recognition (ASR) for such an interface a very challenging problem. In Phase I,
    the feasibility of using WeVoice proprietary microphone array signal processing
    and robust ASR technologies was validated. In particular, it was found that novel
    multichannel noise reduction produces larger gain in SNR than conventional beamforming
    but the latter is more preferable as far as ASR is concerned. In addition, it was
    confirmed that the model adaptation algorithm can make an ASR system more robust
    inside spacesuits. An arithmetic complexity model for ASR was developed. It can
    direct the decision as to whether a specified speech interface is sufficiently efficient
    to be possibly implemented with a wearable system. Phase II will analyze and minimize
    the scientific and engineering uncertainties identified during Phase I. Furthermore,
    a voice command interface for future generations of a suit's processing system is
    proposed to be developed on DSP chips. The system should be ready for testing and
    use by NASA suited crewmembers at the end of Phase II.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
