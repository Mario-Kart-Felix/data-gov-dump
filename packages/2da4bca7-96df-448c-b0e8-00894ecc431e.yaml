    documents associated with remediation activities at the Rocky Flats National Wildlife
    Refuge. The Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge was once of 13 nuclear weapons
    production facilities in the United States during the Cold War and was managed by
    the Department of Energy (DOE). The plant operated from 1952 to 1994 with manufacturing
    activities taking place in the center portion of the site with a large buffer zone
    around the area. In 1989, nuclear production work stopped to address environmental
    and safety concerns. Although work resumed in 1990, the mission was terminated when
    President George H. W. Bush canceled the W-88 Trident Warhead program in 1992. Nuclear
    and nonnuclear production stopped in 1993, and in 1994 the last shipment of defense-related
    materials was sent off-site.When the facilityu2019s mission changed from production
    to cleanup and closure, it was renamed the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology
    Site (RFETS). The site was added to the Environmental Protection Agencyu2019s National
    Priorities List (Superfund List) in 1989. With oversight from the EPA and Colorado
    Department of Public Health and the Environment (CDPHE), the DOE completed the $7
    billion dollar cleanup in 2005. The Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act of
    2001 (Pub.L. 107-107, 115 Stat. 1379, enacted December 8, 2001), mandated that once
    remediation was complete the site would become a national wildlife refuge.U.S. Fish
    and Wildlife Service (Service) policy requires a Level III Preacquisition Survey
    when it is determined, on the basis of the Level I or II Survey, that there is a
    reasonable basis to assume that hazardous substances were present on the real property
    or that there were effects of such hazardous substances present at the site, and
    extensive work (e.g. "significant" sampling and original research) is required
    to determine the extent of any hazardous substance, obtain an estimate of the remediation
    or other cleanup costs, and determine whether reprogramming is required. Although
    no formal Level I or II Surveys were conducted at the RFETS, the history of the
    site, coupled with evidence of contamination revealed during extensive DOE and contractor
    sampling, before and during the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS),
    provided reasonable basis to conduct a Modified Level III Survey.This report concludes
    that the review of the data collected by DOE and their contractors and stored in
    the RI-ready database showed that the database used for the Remedial Investigation
    was of adequate quality to make determinations on the clean up process and the comprehensive
    risk assessment. The Service was included in the comprehensive risk assessment workgroup
    and was presented the opportunity, along with the EPA and CDPHE to comment on the
    development and assumptions used in the risk assessment. The comprehensive risk
    assessment was conservative enough in its assumptions that clean up work that was
    completed by DOE and its contractor, for all receptors at the Rocky Flats National
    Wildlife Refuge, are protective of human health and the environment in the Peripheral
    OU. Supplementary/confirmatory sampling done by Service personnel supported the
    database used by DOE and its contractor and the comprehensive risk assessment. Service
    sampling results were, although not always at or below background levels, well within
    the range of results that DOE presented in their RI-ready database.The refuge was
    officially established in 2007.",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras":
