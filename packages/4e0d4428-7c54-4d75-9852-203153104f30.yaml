    by MCC to develop and conduct an evaluation of the Malawi Compact. Specifically,
    SI has been tasked to u201cassess the program design and implementation to develop
    the most rigorous evaluation design feasible, whether it is a performance or impact
    evaluation, and identify the most appropriate evaluation methodology feasible given
    the context.u201d nEfforts to identify a research design that would allow for a
    rigorously defined counterfactual were unsuccessful, and as a result this design
    document outlines plans for a rigorous performance evaluation that will aim to measure
    key outcome indicators early on in the Compact, midway through, and at the end of
    the Compact, as well as track changes over time. This evaluation is designed to
    address the core questions of the evaluation (Table 1) Since the proposed design
    is a performance evaluation, it is important to note that it may not be possible
    to state with confidence how the power sector in Malawi has changed (or not changed)
    as a result of the Compact, as it will not be possible to control for other potential
    causes of change. In some cases, however, it may be feasible to identify and potentially
    rule out alternative explanations.nThe inability to define a counterfactual requires
    a reformulation of some of the initial evaluation questions originally proposed
    by MCC, including some core questions included in the SI-MCC contract. In addition,
    the Evaluation Assessment Report revealed that both SI and MCC had substantial concerns
    with regard to the original research questions proposed in Social Impact's contract.
    This is natural given the way that interventions change over time, and that the
    proposed questions should be feasible to answer based on the data that can be collected
    as part of the evaluation. Based on SI's comprehensive desk review, information
    gathered during the scoping trip, and frequent communication with MCC and MCA-M,
    the SI evaluation team has developed research questions and research approaches
    for the PSRP and the IDP project components, as proposed in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.
    The original questions and the suggested modifications for each question are presented
    in the Appendix. nnnResearch QuestionsnThrough a rigorous performance evaluation,
    the evaluation design aims to answer the following core evaluation questions and
    several complementary research questions:nn1. What declines in poverty, increases
    in economic growth, reductions in the electricity related cost of doing business,
    increases in access to electricity, and increases in value added production are
    observed over the life of the Compact?n2. What were the results of the interventions
    - intended and unintended, positive or negative?n3. Are there differences in outcomes
    of interest by gender, age and income? Sex and income disaggregated information
    for businesses and households will be pursued to the extent possible.n4. What are
    the lessons learned and are they applicable to other similar projects?n5. What is
    the likelihood that the results of the Project will be sustained over time?n6. At
    the household level, the evaluations shall focus on the following program/project/activities
    impacts on household and individuals: income; expenditures, consumption and access
    to energy; individual time devoted to leisure and productive activities. n7. At
    the enterprise level, the evaluation shall focus on the potential impact of the
    program/project/activities on: business profitability and productivity; value added
    production and investment; employment and wage changes; energy consumption and sources
    of energy used; business losses. n8. At the regulatory, institutional and policy
    level, the evaluation shall explore the potential impacts of the program/project/activities
    on: utility operating costs and losses; financial sustainability; private investment,
    particularly in generation; expansion of electricity access for customers, particularly
    the poor.nnTo answer these questions, the evaluation design will leverage diverse
    research methodologies with different timelines for data collection. The evaluation
    design can be broken into three main parts, albeit with some overlap: nnu00b7 IDP
    evaluation: The IDP design focuses primarily on an intensive metering effort to
    measure the technical benefits of the project, including changes in energy delivered,
    outages, and quality. This will be complemented by focus groups with residents of
    beneficiary communities. nu00b7 PSRP evaluation: The PSRP design incorporates five
    data collection activities, including: (1) quantitative indicators from the M&E
    Plan and Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority (MERA) key performance indicators, (2)
    workflow analyses with relevant units, such as billing and procurement, (3) a series
    of largely qualitative research activities (with some mini-surveys included), (4)
    a proposed survey of Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi (ESCOM) employees,
    and (5) the PSRP process evaluation, focused on implementation and achievement of
    implementation milestones and outputs will be folded into the PSRP data collection
    activities. nu00b7 Enterprise survey: A panel survey of businesses will be used
    to evaluate both the PSRP and the IDP. nnIDP Evaluation DesignnDesign OverviewnWe
    propose that the IDP evaluation consist of two major parts: (1) intensive metering
    to determine technical benefits, and (2) focus group discussions with beneficiaries.
    In addition, some of the activities conducted as part of the PSRP evaluation - specifically
    work flow analyses of response to outages - will also address IDP benefits made
    possible by the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. nnPSRPnSocial
    Impact proposes five data collection activities for the PSRP evaluation: (1) quantitative
    indicators from the M&E Plan and MERA key performance indicators, (2) workflow analyses
    with relevant units, (3) largely qualitative research activities (with some mini-surveys
    included), (4) a survey of current ESCOM employees, and (5) process evaluation.
    These activities will occur in three phases: at baseline (to be conducted as soon
    as possible), at midline, and at the end of the Compact. The evaluation will seek
    to identify changes over time and then consider the extent to which any observed
    improvements can be attributed to Compact activities.n      ",nt"license_title":
