  Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) database. The geodatabasesn
  \                   include feature class layers of information for the fifty states,
  the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island areas (American Samoa, the
  n                    Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the
  United States Virgin Islands). The geodatabases do not contain any sensitive data.
  The n                    2015 TIGER Geodatabases are designed for use with Esriu00e2u0080u0099s
  ArcGIS. n                n                    The 2015 State Geodatabase for California
  contains multiple layers. These layers are the Block, Block Group, Census Designated
  Place, Census Tract, County Subdivision andn                    Incorporated Place
  layers.n                                       n                    Block Groups
  (BGs) are clusters of blocks within the same census tract. Each census tract contains
  at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numberedn                    within census
  tracts.  BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs have the same first digit
  of their 4-digit census block number from the samen                    decennial
  census.  For example, tabulation blocks numbered 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within
  census tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within thatn                    census
  tract.  BGs coded 0 are intended to only include water area, no land area, and they
  are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, andn                    Great
  Lakes water areas. Block groups generally contain  between 600 and 3,000 people.
  \ A BG usually covers a contiguous area but never crossesn                    county
  or census tract boundaries. They may, however, cross the boundaries of other geographic
  entities like county subdivisions, places, urbann                    areas, voting
  districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native
  Hawaiian areas. n                    n                    The BG boundaries in this
  release are those that were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant
  Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for then                    2010 Census.  n                    n
  \                   The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable
  set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back
  ton                    previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have
  a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000
  people.n                    When first delineated, census tracts were designed to
  be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and
  livingn                    conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies
  widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns
  caused byn                    highway construction, new development, and so forth,
  may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split
  due ton                    population growth, or combined as a result of substantial
  population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiablen
  \                   features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil
  division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations ton
  \                   allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where
  the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State andn
  \                   county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the
  standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract mayn
  \                   consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may
  occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entitiesn
  \                   that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census, the
  census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts thatn
  \                   include a majority American Indian population according to Census
  2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized Americann
  \                   Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the
  code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained
  littlen                    or no population and represented a relatively large special
  land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrialn
  \                   park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for
  those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.  n                    n
  \                   An incorporated place is established to provide governmental
  functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD),n
  \                   which generally is created to provide services or administer
  an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a
  state,n                    but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.
  \ An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can haven
  \                   other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial
  census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineatedn
  \                   to provide data for settled concentrations of population that
  are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the
  staten                    in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often
  are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually
  coinciden                    with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent
  incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one
  decennialn                    census to the next with changes in the settlement
  pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not
  necessarilyn                    have the same boundary.  The only population/housing
  size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.
  \ n                    n                    The boundaries of most incorporated
  places in this shapefile are as of January 1, 2013, as reported through the Census
  Bureau's Boundary andn                    Annexation Survey (BAS).  Limited updates
  that occurred after January 1, 2013, such as newly incorporated places, are also
  included.  The boundariesn                    of all CDPs were delineated as part
  of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010
  Census.n                    n                    The primary legal divisions of
  most states are termed counties.  In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes.
  \ In Alaska, which has non                    counties, the equivalent entities
  are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized
  area, census areas.  Then                    latter are delineated cooperatively
  for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.  In four
  states (Maryland, Missouri,n                    Nevada, and Virginia), there are
  one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization
  and thus constitute primaryn                    divisions of their states.  These
  incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent
  entities for purposes of datan                    presentation.  The District of
  Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent
  entity for purposes of datan                    presentation.  The Census Bureau
  treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation:
  Municipios in Puerton                    Rico, Districts and Islands in American
  Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands
  in the U.S. Virginn                    Islands.  The entire area of the United States,
  Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.
  \ n                    n                    The boundaries for counties and equivalent
  entities are mostly as of January 1, 2013, primarily as reported through the Census
  Bureau's Boundary andn                    Annexation Survey (BAS).  However, some
  changes made after January 2013, including the addition and deletion of counties,
  are included.n                    n                    County subdivisions are the
  primary divisions of counties and their equivalent entities for the reporting of
  Census Bureau data. They includen                    legally-recognized minor civil
  divisions (MCDs) and statistical census county divisions (CCDs), and unorganized
  territories.  For the 2010 Census,n                    the MCDs are the primary
  governmental and/or administrative divisions of counties in 29 States and Puerto
  Rico; Tennessee changed from having CCDsn                    for Census 2000 to
  having MCDs for the 2010 Census.  In MCD States where no MCD exists or is not defined,
  the Census Bureau creates statisticaln                    unorganized territories
  to complete coverage.  The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the
  Island Areas are covered by countyn                    subdivisions.  The boundaries
  of most legal MCDs are as of January 1, 2013, as reported through the Census Bureau's
  Boundary and Annexation Surveyn                    (BAS).  n                    n
