    and littermass and litter carbon, nitrogen, and nutrient concentrations were extracted
    from 685 original literature sources and compiled into a comprehensive database
    to support the analysis of global patterns of carbon and nutrients in litterfall
    and litter pools. Data are included from sources dating from 1827 to 1997. The reported
    data include the literature reference, general site information (description, latitude,
    longitude, and elevation), site climate data (mean annual temperature and precipitation),
    site vegetation characteristics (management, stand age, ecosystem and vegetation-type
    codes), annual quantities of litterfall (by class, kg m-2 yr-1), litter pool mass
    (by class and litter layer, kg m-2), and concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus
    (P), and base cations for the litterfall (g m-2 yr-1) and litter pool components
    (g m-2).  The investigators intent was to compile a comprehensive data set of individual
    direct field measurements as reported by researchers. While the primary emphasis
    was on acquiring C data, measurements of N, P, and base cations were also obtained,
    although the database is sparse for elements other than C and N. Each of the 1,497
    records in the database represents a measurement site. Replicate measurements were
    averaged according to conventions described in Section 5 and recorded for each site
    in the database. The sites were at 575 different locations. ",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
