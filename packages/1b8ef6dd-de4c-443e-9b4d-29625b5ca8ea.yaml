    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Actuator systems are employed widely in
    aerospace, transportation and industrial processes to provide power to critical
    loads, such as aircraft control surfaces. They must operate reliably and accurately
    in order for the vehicle / process to complete successfully its designated mission.
    Incipient actuator failure conditions may severely endanger the operational integrity
    of the vehicle / process and compromise its mission. The ability to maintain a stable
    and credible operation, even in the presence of incipient failures, is of paramount
    importance to accomplish u201cmust achieveu201d mission objectives. This paper introduces
    a novel methodology for the fault-tolerant design of critical subsystems, such as
    an ElectroMechanical Actuator (EMA), that takes advantage of on-line, real-time
    estimates of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) or Time-to-Failure (TTF) of a failing
    component and reconfigures the available control authority by trading off system
    performance with control activity. The primary goal is to complete critical mission
    objectives within a time window dictated by prognostic algorithms so that the fault
    mode is accommodated and an acceptable level of performance maintained for the duration
    of the mission. The proposed fault-tolerant control design is mathematically rigorous,
    generic and applicable to a variety of application domains. An EMA is used to illustrate
    the efficacy of the proposed approach.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
