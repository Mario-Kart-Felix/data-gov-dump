  of its kind in space, is an electronically scanning radar, operating at 13.8 GHz
  that measures the 3-D rainfall distribution over both land and ocean, and defines
  the layer depth of the precipitation.n                        nThe objectives of
  2A25 is to correct for the rain attenuation in measured radar reflectivity and to
  estimate the instantaneous three-dimensional distribution of rain from the TRMM
  Precipitation Radar (PR) data.  The estimates of attenuation-corrected radar reflectivity
  factor and rainfall rate are given at each resolution cell of the PR.  The estimated
  near-surface rainfall rate and average rainfall rate between the two pre-defined
  altitudes (2 and 4 km) are also calculated for each beam position.n                        n2A25
  basically uses a hybrid of the Hitschfeld-Bordan method and the surface reference
  method to estimate the vertical true radar reflectivity (Z) profile.  (The hybrid
  method is described in Iguchi and Meneghini (1994)).  The vertical rain profile
  is then calculated from the estimated true Z profile by using an appropriate Z-R
  relationship.n                        nThe attenuation correction is, in principle,
  based on the surface reference method. This method assumes that the decrease in
  the apparent surface cross section (delta sigma-zero) is caused by the propagation
  loss in rain. The coefficient a in the k-Z relationship, k=a Z**b, is adjusted in
  such a way that the path-integrated attenuation (PIA) estimated from the measured
  Zm-profile will match the delta sigma-zero.  The attenuation correction of Z is
  carried out by the Hitschfeld-Bordan method with the modified a.  Since a is adjusted,
  this type of surface reference method is called the a-adjustment method.  The a-adjustment
  method assumes that the discrepancy between the PIA estimate from delta sigma-zero
  and that from the measured Zm-profile can be attributed to the inappropriate choice
  of a values, which may vary depending on the raindrop size distribution and other
  conditions.  It assumes that the radar is properly calibrated and that the measured
  Zm has no error.n                        nIn order to avoid inaccuracies in the
  attenuation correction when rain is weak, a hybrid of the surface reference method
  and the Hitschfeld-Bordan method is used (Iguchi and Meneghini, 1994).  The PIA
  is first estimated from the precipitation echo alone.  The weight given by the hybrid
  method to the PIA estimate from the surface reference increases as the attenuation
  estimate increases.  When rain is very weak and the attenuation estimate is small,
  the PIA estimate from the surface reference is effectively neglected.  With the
  introduction of the hybrid method, the divergence associated with the Hitschfeld-Bordan
  method is also prevented.n                        nOne major difference from the
  method described in the above reference is that, in order to deal with the beam-filling
  problem, a non-uniformity parameter is introduced and is used to correct the bias
  in the surface reference arising from the horizontal non-uniformity of rain field
  within the beam. Since radar echoes from near the surface are contaminated by the
  mainlobe clutter, the rain estimate at the lowest point in the clutter-free region
  is given as the near-surface rainfall rate for each angle bin.n                        nSpatial
  coverage is between 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South, owing to the 35 degree
  inclination of the TRMM satellite. This orbit provides extensive coverage in the
  tropics and allows each location to be covered at a different local time each day,
  enabling the analysis of the diurnal cycle of precipitation. There are, in general,
  9150 scans along the orbit, with each scan consisting of 49 rays.  The scan width
  is about 220 km.       n                  nThe data are stored in the Hierarchical
  Data Format (HDF), which includes both core and product specific metadata applicable
  to the PR measurements.  A fi...\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S. Government Work\",\n\t\"extras\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
