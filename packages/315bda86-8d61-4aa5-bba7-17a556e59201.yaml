    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Health management (HM) technologies have
    been employed for safety critical system for decades, but a coherent systematic
    process to integrate HM into the system design is not yet clear. Consequently, in
    most cases, health management resorts to be an after-thought or u2018band-aidu2019
    solution. Moreover, limited guidance exists for carrying out systems engineering
    (SE) on the subject of writing requirements for designs with integrated vehicle
    health management (IVHM). It is well accepted that requirements are key to developing
    a successful IVHM system right from the concept stage to development, verification,
    utilization, and support. However, writing requirements for systems with IVHM capability
    have unique challenges that require the designers to look beyond their own domains
    and consider the constraints and specifications of other interlinked systems. In
    this paper we look at various stages in the SE process and identify activities specific
    to IVHM design and development. More importantly, several relevant questions are
    posed that system engineers must address at various design and development stages.
    Addressing these questions should provide some guidance to systems engineers towards
    writing IVHM related requirements to ensure that appropriate IVHM functions are
    built into the system design",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
