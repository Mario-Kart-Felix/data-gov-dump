    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "NASA has serious unmet needs for simulation
    tools capable of predicting the behavior of lunar regolith in proposed excavation,
    transport and handling systems.  Existing discrete element method (DEM) or finite
    element (FE) models lack adequate fidelity for fine cohesive powders comprised of
    friable particles with irregular shapes and exhibiting substantial bulk dilation
    upon initial excavation.  As such, they are inadequate for assessing the reliability
    of regolith excavation and handling systems, and even less so for evaluation of
    engineering trade-offs between total system mass, power and energy consumption.
     Also, current simulation tools do not include the effects of triboelectric and
    photo-ionization-induced charges on regolith particles.rnBuilding on the successful
    Phase-1development of a new charge-patch electrostatic model and a comprehensive
    cohesive particle interaction model for DEM, Grainflow Dynamics proposes to develop
    a high-fidelity predictive calculational tool, in the form of a DEM module with
    calibrated interparticle-interaction relationships, coupled with a FE module utilizing
    enhanced, calibrated, constitutive models which, together, are capable of mimicking
    both large deformations and the flow behavior of regolith simulants and lunar regolith
    under conditions anticipated in ISRU operations. This will not only provide unparalleled
    fidelity but also will leverage the computational efficiency of the continuum FE
    codes to drastically reduce the simulation time and resources necessary to perform
    engineering analyses on regolith systems. In addition, the modules will be parallelized
    to maximize their usefulness in multi-core and cluster computing environments. This
    work will lead to an improved engineering design tool that can be used by NASA engineers
    and contractors developing designs for ISRU equipment to evaluate both the reliability
    of various configurations as well as the trade-offs of system designs.rn",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
