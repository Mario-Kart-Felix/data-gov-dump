	"notes": "Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) is a multicenter, multiagency (with the Department of Energy (DOE)) program whose purpose is to manage the Science Mission Directorate?s investments in radioisotope power systems and their deployment to future missions. The majority of these missions are a result of planning arising from the Planetary Science Division.\n\nRPS is responsible for acquisition and development of thermal energy conversion technologies and related system technologies and with the DOE, acquisition and development of flight radioisotope power systems for future mission uses. In addition, the RPS Program is responsible for maintaining a capability to acquire future systems through strategic investment in unique competencies that may be needed by future missions.\n\nOne element of RPS is Radioisotope Power Systems Technology Development. The goal of the radioisotope power systems? technology portfolio is to advance performance of RPS through new and novel innovations being developed and transitioned to flight systems. Historically, this has been achieved through an increase of energy conversion efficiency. The mission users benefit from such a gain in performance because an increase in the specific power (power per unit mass) reduces the spacecraft mass. This reduction can also enable a larger instrument suite. The effort to improve efficiency has taken on renewed significance with the increased constraint posed by a limited supply of Pu-238. Current investments include improving efficiency of thermoelectrics through novel materials selections, the Stirling conversion process, and supported systems development on materials and electronics.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
