    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;The need for electrostatic analyzers
    to measure ion and electron fluxes in near-Earth space is nearly ubiquitous in Heliophysics
    missions. In the latest example, NASA&amp;rsquo;s MMS mission slated for launch
    in 2014 features fully 32 electron and 32 ion spectrometers. These plasma measurements
    are central to the vast majority of such missions. The range of fluxes and energies
    to be covered is extremely wide, in view of the wide range of plasma conditions
    across the heliophysics realm. The GSFC Heliophysics Division enjoys a distinguished
    tradition of developing and flying these devices and is well placed to provide future
    leadership in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two specific and related thrusts within
    the field demand the development of minimum resource instrument work horses for
    future missions. Those are constellation missions and the development and proliferation
    of Cube-sats. The Cube-sats themselves may well comprise the elements of future
    constellations. Constellations, or groups of spacecraft providing networks of observation
    points, have been called for in both the current and past HPD roadmaps. Early, small
    number constellations have been realized with NASA&amp;rsquo;s Themis mission (5
    sc) and ESA&amp;rsquo;s Cluster mission (4 sc). MMS itself is comprised of 4 sc.
    Future mission concepts call for constellations with many more sc. Realization of
    these concepts will require individual instruments and supporting spacecraft systems
    with phenomenally small physical resource requirements. Progress is being made quickly
    on the spacecraft system side, with lots of innovation evident in Cube-sat architectures,
    subsystems, and deployment systems. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The time to focus on
    resource minimization for work horse instruments is now!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
    overarching goal of this IRAD is to exploit the definition of clear simple and non-exceptional
    performance requirements with innovative design and fabrication techniques and,
    perhaps, a relatively high risk tolerance, to develop an ESA package design that
    will feature basic functionality over a wide range of energies and fluxes, with
    minimum physical resource requirements and a high level of manufacturability. We
    will pursue this goal by developing a package concept that can fit and operate in
    a 1U x 1U Cube-sat. Specific objectives of this first development year include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define
    minimalist science requirements for a low-resource, workhorse class ESA package
    for HPD missions that meet objectives in the proposed DIONE Cube-sat mission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flow
    these down to a correspondingly minimalist set of HVPS requirements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design,
    develop, and demonstrate a prototype HVPS that meets defined requirements and fits
    within the volumetric envelope available in the proposed DIONE payload.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perform
    a conceptual ion &amp;amp; electron ESA package design, based on a 1&amp;rdquo;
    dia. MCP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conduct a feasibility study on use of additive
    manufacturing technology (3D printing) in manufacturing small, and very light weight
    miniature ESA and detector assemblies and/or components with sufficient strength
    and dimensional precision.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
