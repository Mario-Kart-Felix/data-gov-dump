    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "One of the key problems that arises in many
    areas is to estimate a potentially nonlinear function [tex] G(x, theta)[/tex] given
    input and output samples [tex] ( X,y ) [/tex] so that [tex]y approx G(x, theta)[/tex].rnrnrnThere
    are many approaches to addressing this regression problem. Neural networks, regression
    trees, and many other methods have been developed to estimate [tex]$G$[/tex] given
    the input output pair [tex] ( X,y ) [/tex].rnrnOne method that I have worked with
    is called Gaussian process regression. There many good texts and papers on the subject.
    For more technical information on the method and its applications see: http://www.gaussianprocess.org/rnrnA
    key problem that arises in developing these models on very large data sets is that
    it ends up requiring an [tex]O(N^3)[/tex] computation where N is the number of data
    points and the training sample. Obviously this becomes very problematic when N is
    large.rnrnI discussed this problem with Leslie Foster, a mathematics professor at
    San Jose State University.  He, along with some of his students, developed a method
     to address this problem based on Cholesky decomposition and pivoting.   He also
    shows that this leads to a numerically stable result.  If ou're interested in some
    light reading, Iu2019d suggest you take a look at his [recent paper](    ) (which
    was accepted in the Journal of Machine Learning Research) posted on dashlink. We've
    also posted code for you to try it out. Let us know how it goes.rnrnIf you are interested
    in applications of this method in the area of prognostics, check out our [new paper](/dashlink/resources/51/)
    on the subject which was published in IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
