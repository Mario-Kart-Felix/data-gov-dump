  derived from the Census Places dataset. Original abstract: The TIGER/Line Files
  are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected
  geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address
  File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER)
  Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or
  gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as
  an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The
  TIGER/Line Files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated
  places or CDPs (statistical entities). An incorporated place is established to provide
  governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil
  division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an
  area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a State,
  but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated
  place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions.
  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of
  incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations
  of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under
  the laws of the State in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are
  defined in partnership with State, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide
  with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another
  legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next
  with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name
  as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing
  size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing
  and population. The boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places are as of
  January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation
  Survey (BAS). The boundaries of all 2010 Census CDPs were delineated as part of
  the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).\",\n\t\"license_title\":
