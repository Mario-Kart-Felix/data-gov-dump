    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "A reduced dynamical model describing temperature
    stratification effects driven by natural convection in a liquid hydrogen cryogenic
    fuel tank has been developed. It accounts for cryogenic propellant loading, storage,
    and unloading in the conditions of normal, increased, and micro- gravity. The model
    involves multiple horizontal control volumes in both liquid and ullage spaces. Temperature
    and velocity boundary layers at the tank walls are taken into account by using correlation
    relations. Heat exchange involving the tank wall is considered by means of the lumped-parameter
    method. By employing basic conservation laws, the model takes into consideration
    the major multi-phase mass and energy exchange processes involved, such as condensation-evaporation
    of the hydrogen, as well as flows of hydrogen liquid and vapor in the presence of
    pressurizing helium gas. The model involves a liquid hydrogen feed line and a tank
    ullage vent valve for pressure control. The temperature stratification effects are
    investigated, including in the presence of vent valve oscillations. A simulation
    of temperature stratification effects in a generic cryogenic tank has been implemented
    in Matlab and results are presented for various tank conditions.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
