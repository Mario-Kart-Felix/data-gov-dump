    1 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of the south shore of St. Thomas,
    US Virgin Islands.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel,
    in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private
    sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from
    2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam
    echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software.
    Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced
    to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data
    is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The processed CARIS data was used to generate
    a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle with footprint size 3*3. An ASCII XYZ
    file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event.
    Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster', with cell size 1, was used
    to generate the final ESRI Geotiff. While the project was conducted to meet IHO
    Order 2 accuracy standards, there is a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in the
    dataset that the user should take into consideration when performing any analysis.",nt"license_title":
