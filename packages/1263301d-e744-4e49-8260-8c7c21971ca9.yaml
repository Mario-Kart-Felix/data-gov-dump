  & Ranging) 5x5 meter resolution bathymetric surface for an area surrounding the
  mouth of Salt River Bay (SARI)St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). The image's
  horizontal coordinate system is NAD83 UTM 20 North, and depth values are in meters
  referenced to Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) heights. Fugro LADS, in collaboration
  with NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, the University of New Hampshire
  and the National Park Service, acquired bathymetry, relative seafloor reflectivity
  and hyperspectral imagery in St. Croix from 2/21 to 2/22/2011. Hyperspectral data
  were acquired using a Hyspex VNIR-1600 sensor. Bathymetry and reflectivity data
  were acquired using a LADS (Laser Airborne Depth Sounder) Mark II Airborne System
  from altitudes between 1,200 and 2,200ft at ground speeds between 140 and 175 knots.
  The 900 Hertz Nd: YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet) laser (1064 nm)
  acquired 5x5 meter spot spacing and 200% seabed coverage. In total, 1.62 square
  kilometers of LiDAR were collected between 0 m and 34 m in depth. Environmental
  factors such as wind strength and direction, cloud cover, water clarity and depth
  influenced the area of data acquisition on a daily basis. The data was processed
  using the LADS Mark II Ground System and data visualization, quality control and
  final products were created using CARIS HIPS and SIPS and CARIS BASE Editor. All
  users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their
  own needs and standards.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\":
