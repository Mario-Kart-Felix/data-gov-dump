    of the CRCP-funded project aimed at establishing baseline Rapid Ecological Assessment
    (REA) surveys for coral reef benthic cover and composition at Faga'alu Bay, Tutuila,
    American Samoa. Quantitative belt transect surveys for coral generic abundance and
    diseases condition were conducted, from 20120813 to 20120816, at 17 survey sites
    by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries
    Science Center (PIFSC). As a part of REA surveys, the coral belt surveys were focused
    on quantifying the diversity, abundance, and density, of the anthozoan and hydrozoan
    corals as well as the condition and health state of the coral reef populations.
    The surveys were conducted along two consecutively-placed, 25 m transect lines.
    The belt width was 1 m wide, 0.5 m on each side of the transect line. Within each
    25 m transect, five 2.5 m segments were surveyed (beginning at points: 0, 5, 10,
    15, and 20 meters), whereby in each segment, all coral colonies whose center fell
    within 0.5 m of either side of the transect line were identified to the lowest taxonomic
    level possible (genus or species) and two planar size metrics were collected: maximum
    diameter and diameter perpendicular to the maximum diameter. In addition, the extent
    of mortality, both recent and old, was estimated for each colony. Observers paid
    special attention to identifying as best as possible the extent of the former live
    colony. When a coral colony exhibited signs of disease or compromised health, additional
    information was recorded including type of affliction (bleaching, skeletal growth
    anomaly, white syndrome, tissue loss other than white syndrome, trematodiasis, necrosis,
    other, pigmentation responses, algal overgrowth, and predation), severity of the
    affliction (mild, moderate, marked, severe, acute), as well as photographic documentation
    and occasional tissue samples. Tissue samples were cataloged and fixed in buffered
    zinc-formalin solution for further histopathological analyses. Raw survey data included
    species presence and relative abundance, colony counts per taxon, size (width and
    length), mortality, predation, and health status. A surveyed area was ranging from
    10 m^2 to 25 m^2 per site.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
