	"notes": "Metro30 is a data collection consisting of approximately 150 raster-formatted data layers for the 7-county Twin Cities Metropolitan Area. It is available on CD-ROM in EPPL7 format. The data themes cover a wide range of physical and biological variables along with administrative, political, sociodemographic, and transportation data. Most data on the Metro30 data collection has been gridded at a 30-meter cell size from vector linework of varying scales. Some data layers were created from the MGC100 100-meter statewide data set by clipping the statewide file to the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area border, then resampling the data to the 30-meter level. However, this processing step does not improve the original accuracy of the data. The Metro30 Dataset is available on the same CD as the MGC100 statewide 100-meter dataset.",
