    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;Space environments are particularly
    harsh for the high-strength fibers we have come to rely on for soft structures.&amp;nbsp;
    Kevlar, Nomex, Nylon, and other synthetic fibers are broken down by exposure to
    the combination of vacuum, atomic oxygen, and ultraviolet radiation.&amp;nbsp; Glass
    fiber does not have this same susceptibility, but requires an end termination that
    does not bend its fibers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many proposals for future manned space
    habitation use inflatable soft structures to produce large habitable volumes.&amp;nbsp;
    Glass fiber is unique in its ability to withstand atomic oxygen and ultraviolet
    radiation without degradation, however, it is subject to failure at reduced loads
    if it is bent over a tight radius.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, current practice has
    been developed with fibers that do not have this shortcoming, and end terminations
    are typically made by sewing a loop and placing it in a clevis / pin connection.
    Proof-of-concept work has been performed on potted terminations using a flight-rated
    high temperature epoxy.&amp;nbsp; This work has produced tensile specimens with
    close to the breaking strength of the webbing. The initial termination using epoxy
    potting and aluminum termination blocks was investigated with various lengths of
    webbing potted, and pulled to failure.&amp;nbsp; Through this testing, it was determined
    that a 1/2&amp;quot; long bonded length was required to develop full strength in
    1&amp;quot; wide webbing, 0.03 thick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While showing promise compared
    to a pin-and-loop termination, the aluminum termination block has several disadvantages:
    1) the end terminations must be both taller and wider than the webbing itself. 2)
    the potting process employs a cleaning process to which the fiber is sensitive.&amp;nbsp;
    This was assumed to be needed to get a high-strength bond directly to the glass
    fiber.&amp;nbsp; Failure was often observed at the edge of the cleaned fiber. 3)
    the termination block and the fiber/epoxy composite bond will have to be shown to
    be robust enough to survive vacuum, thermal extremes, and any other environmental
    conditions to which the structure will be subjected to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During
    the course of development, some thought was given to the elimination of these disadvantages.
    Changing the end termination material from aluminum to fiberglass offered improvements
    in all three areas of concern.&amp;nbsp; The end termination that resulted is no
    wider than the webbing itself, and shorter than the aluminum version.&amp;nbsp;
    The compatibility of the webbing bond to the end fitting is clearly superior, as
    both are glass/epoxy composites, and will be affected similarly by environmental
    factors.&amp;nbsp; Lastly, changes to both simplify and reduce stress on the glass
    fibers during cleaning were implemented, demonstrating that full webbing strength
    can be obtained.&amp;nbsp; The sum of these design iterations resulted in significant
    improvements in reliability and strength of the joint, with a reduction in size
    and weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting end termination is one fifth to one
    tenth the weight of conventionally terminated webbing, and is volumetrically smaller
    by about the same ratio.&amp;nbsp; Attachment to other structural elements may be
    through a pinned or bolted arrangement, as was used in the testing, or in the case
    of a composite structure (carbon/epoxy or glass fiber/epoxy), this new end termination
    can be bonded directly to the composite structure.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
