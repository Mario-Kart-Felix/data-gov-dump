This leakage results in various forms of internal damage to series valve ball valve pinions and actuator assembly components.&amp;nbsp; Two in-flight anomalies occurred during Shuttle flight history (STS-91 OMS-E serial number [S\/N] 107; and STS-101 on OMS-E S\/N 111) that were direct results of propellant vapor leakage.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tTesting was performed in FY 2012 and 2013 to attempt to characterize\/determine the conditions under which the vapors migrate\/permeate past the redundant (primary and secondary) shafts seals on the ball valve pinions and into the actuator housings.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2012 a &amp;ldquo;simple soak&amp;rdquo; test was performed in which NTO and MMH were introduced into their respective cavities in a flight series valve and vapor break-through monitored downstream of the primary and secondary shaft seals of each of the four ball valves using vapor detection devices.&amp;nbsp; The follow-on testing performed in FY 2013 focuses on the MMH part of the series valve.&amp;nbsp; In this test, MMH is introduced into the cavity between the fuel ball valves, the cavity pressurized to 250 pounds per square inch gage (psig), and monitoring performed downstream of the primary and secondary shaft seals using vapor detection devices.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tFY 2012 soak tests resulted in evidence of NTO vapor permeation past the primary and secondary shaft seals of the oxidizer ball valves in 2.5 and 18.5 hours respectively.&amp;nbsp; While MMH vapor permeation was measured at the primary shaft seal locations of the fuel ball valves in 1.5 hours, no evidence of permeation past the secondary shaft seal was measured after 6 weeks of data logging.&amp;nbsp; This resulted in the follow-on test in FY 2013 to add pressurization of the fuel ball valve cavity to determine if this would result in MMH vapor measurements downstream of the fuel ball valve secondary shaft seal locations.&amp;nbsp; FY 2013 testing will be completed by September 2013 and results compiled in a test report.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
