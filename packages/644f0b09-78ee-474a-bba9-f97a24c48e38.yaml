  of the Middle Rio Grande/Albuquerque Urban Waters Partnership for the region including
  Albuquerque, New Mexico.The Middle Rio Grande/Albuquerque Urban Waters Federal Partnership
  is co-chaired by the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Environmental
  Protection Agency. There are also a number of other federal agencies engaged in
  projects with Tribal, State, and local officials, and community stakeholders. Like
  many western river ecosystems, the Middle Rio Grande faces numerous challenges in
  balancing competing needs within a finite water supply and other resource constrains.
  Historical practices by our ancestors and immigrants to the Middle Rio Grande have
  established the conditions that we have inherited. Long-term drought exacerbated
  by climate change is changing conditions that affect natural and human communities
  as we strive to improve our precious Rio Grande.The Middle Rio Grande/Albuquerque
  Urban Waters Federal Partnership will reconnect our urban communities, particularly
  those that are overburdened or economically distressed, with the waterway by improving
  coordination among federal agencies and collaborating with community-led revitalization
  efforts. Our projects will improve our community water systems and promote their
  economic, environmental and social benefits. Specifically, the Middle Rio Grande/Albuquerque
  Urban Waters Federal Partnership will support the development of the Valle de Oro
  National Wildlife Refuge, the first urban refuge in the Southwest, as well as numerous
  restoration projects along the Middle Rio Grande/Albuquerque, a pilot watershed-based
  storm water management program, a climate change project, and transportation and
  economic development initiatives in the South Valley.Users can discover more about
  the project on the partnerships website, http://www.urbanwaters.gov/mid-riogrande/index.html.The
  portion of the partnership data provided by the Bureau of Reclamation in support
  of the project is based in significant part on data compiled in support the mapping
  exercise for the DOI Secretaryu00e2u20acu2122s 2012 Middle Rio Grande Conservation
  Initiative Report http://middleriogrande.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=zWjw3lgpeyE%3d&tabid=488&mid=1401&forcedownload=true>
  The data compiled for this report was ultimately presented in the Appendix as maps
  and tabular data and ultimately no metadata was produced other than at the attribute
  level. The original datau00e2u20acu2122s scope was identified as applicable in support
  of the Urban Waters Partnership since the partnership seeks to advance the work
  of the Americau00e2u20acu2122s Great Outdoors Initiative http://www.doi.gov/americasgreatoutdoors/index.cfm>,
  of which the 2012 MRG Conservation Initiative was a part of. This data represents
  an updated and revised dataset of similar scope with additions identifying Conservation,
  Education, and Recreation opportunities within the Middle Rio Grande region from
  Cochiti Reservoir through Elephant Butte Reservoir and as such depicts features
  from a more broad geographic area of interest than the Urban Waters Partnership.Originally,
  maintenance and restoration work was included in the point feature class of the
  MRG Conservation Initiative and classified as a Conservation activity; however,
  many of the restoration activities are better represented by a polyline feature
  class. The dynamic nature of the expected deployment of this data allowed for the
  better representation of each activity as either a point or a polyline. Subsequently,
  the maintenance and restoration activities have been removed from the comparible
  layer in the Urban Waters dataset, UrbanWaters_POIs_Points and devided into two
  feature classes as appropriate, MRG_Activities_line and MRG_Activities_multipoint.
  Unlike the Urban Waters POIs feature classes in which features share overalap in
  representation between point and polygon coverages, these to maintenance and restoration
  activity feature classes are mutually exclusive.The MRG Conservation Initiative
  dataset was compiled by the Technical Services Division of the Albuquerque Area
  Office of the Bureau of Reclamation from multiple sources. Because of the congestive
  nature of the static maps published in the 2012 report, several lesser projects
  were ommitted in 2012. The dataset for the Urban Waters Program however, while not
  depicting any new activities from either 2013 or 2014, has been expanded to depict
  all identified activities from 2002 to 2012. Many maintenance and restoration activities
  coincide with previous activities also resident in this dataset, therfore portions
  of or wholly coincident geometries may identify multiple featues discernable only
  through interogating the data with the identify tool.The source geometry for this
  feature class is a derivative of the National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD) Flowline
  feature class. Along much of the Rio Grande, this feature class is classified as
  an artificial path, i.e., a geometric network path used for directed flow analysis.
  Often these artificial paths do not accurately represent the geometry of the river
  because they are covered by a polygon for cartographic purposes. In any case, the
  NHD is out of date, especially over dynamic features like rivers such as the Rio
  Grande which change annually and indeed with every precipitation or release event.
  Therefore, the source geometry will not reflect the ground truth alignment of the
  Rio Grand at larger scales. All locations are approximate and in no case does the
  geometry reflect or is intended to reflect the actual maintenance and restoration
  activities.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\": \"bbox-east-long\",\n\t\t\"value\":
