    the evaluation estimated the impact of FISP on disease prevalence and estimated
    the consequent impact on coconut production and farmer incomes. In addition, the
    evaluation also assessed the pre-conditions for future increase in income by examining
    whether the seedlings planted through FISP survived. nTo assess these impacts, because
    the ideal approach of randomly assigning treatment to farmers was not feasible,
    the evaluation employed the next best approach. It identified geographic areas that
    were very similar at baseline and were otherwise split into treatment and comparison
    areas by some external u201cquasi-randomu201d factor (the phytosanitary barrier),
    and matched a subset of these areas on disease prevalence and distance to coast.
    This approach is sometimes called a u201cborder discontinuityu201d design in the
    applied microeconomics literature. As mentioned in Section 2.3, the phytosanitary
    barrier was a north-to-south imaginary line that FISP delineated, separating the
    areas with less than 10 percent disease prevalence (on the west side of the barrier)
    from the areas with more than 10 percent disease prevalence (on the east side).
    FISP worked on the west side of the barrier. Defined this way, the project worked
    in the entire epidemic zone. nHowever, in effect this barrier was imperfect because
    while it is true that generally (or on average) the disease prevalence is greater
    near the coast, the disease prevalence has a mosaic pattern. This means that even
    on the east side of the barrier, there can be areas with disease prevalence lower
    than 10 percent. Furthermore, the barrier was imperfectly drawn even along the perceived
    divide of 10 percent prevalence, as it was drawn along natural barriers such as
    water bodies and roads. These characteristics of the barrier and how the FISP treatment
    areas were defined give a unique opportunity to identify the counterfactual areas
    in the areas just east of the barrier. Accordingly, we used the 2008 TTI aerial
    photography data (TTI Production, 2009) to identify areas with similar disease prevalence
    as proximate as possible to either side of the barrier, with the areas on the west
    side serving as treatment areas, and areas on the east side serving as the comparison
    areas . nFrom among all FISP project areas on the east side of the barrier, and
    the non-project areas on the west side of the barrier, we identified areas where
    the disease prevalence was between 0 and 15 percent. These treatment and comparison
    areas amounted to 93 project and 65 non-project census enumeration areas (EAs) very
    close (within 73 kilometers) to the phytosanitary barrier that shared similar disease
    prevalence. Within these areas, we further refined the sample and identified approximately
    24 nearest neighbor pairs of EAs matched on baseline disease prevalence and distance
    to coast. Our sample selection procedure, which resulted in 48 EAs, limits analysis
    and direct applicability to areas close to the phytosanitary barrier. The pairs
    were matched on: nSame districtnAverage baseline CLYD prevalence in 2008, in the
    5-kilometer radiusnDistance to coast.nNo counterfactual EA was u201cmatchedu201d
    with more than one treatment EA.  A small wrinkle in this identification strategy
    was that the FISP phytosanitary barrier was reevaluated a total of five times throughout
    the project, causing the barrier to shift during the course of the implementation
    (see Figure 2-1). To ensure that all comparison areas did not receive treatment,
    we have chosen comparison located east of the 2012 barrier, which is the furthest
    east the barrier was shifted over the course of the project. nIt is important to
    note that in three out of the eight FISP districts there was no barrier drawn: in
    Pebane, Moma, and Angoche, the barrier was the coast, and FISP worked in these districts
    in a way that made it difficult to identify non-project areas. There was no barrier
    drawn in the district of Chinde, but epidemic and endemic zones (as well as project
    and non-project areas) were geographically separated in a way that allowed us to
    include the district in our sampling frame. As a result, our quantitative evaluation
    is focused on five out of the eight FISP districts (Nicoadala, Namacurra, Maganja
    da Costa, Chinde, and Inhassunge). In the remaining three districts in the Nampula
    district, we relied on a qualitative survey to draw lessons about the project's
    efficacy.nIn sum, the phytosanitary barrier distinguished between epidemic FISP
    areas and epidemic non-FISP areas. We identified 93 FISP census EAs on the west
    side of the barrier and 65 non-project EAs on the east side of the phytosanitary
    barrier but very close (within 73 kilometers) with similar baseline disease prevalence
    (using the 2008 aerial photography data from TTI Production, 2009). From these,
    24 pair-wised matched project and non-project areas serve as our treatment and comparison
    groups. Their baseline similarity, geographical similarity, and haphazard separation
    by the phytosanitary barrier create the ideal conditions for a quasi-experimental
    evaluation. This quasi-random approach identifies the impact because difference
    in outcomes can be attributed only to the intervention; other potentially confounding
    factors are similar across the phytosanitary barrier, due to geographic proximity
    and because of matching (Section 5.3 provides more details on the results of the
    matching).nn Householdsn nWe designed two separate quantitative evaluations to assess
    the activities in the epidemic zones and the endemic zones. nEvaluation of Epidemic
    Zone Program: In the epidemic zones, the evaluation used a border discontinuity
    design. Specifically, it identified geographic areas that were very similar at baseline,
    except that they were split into treatment and comparison areas by an external u201cquasi-randomu201d
    factor-the phytosanitary barrier. The phytosanitary barrier was a north-to-south
    imaginary line that FISP delineated, separating the areas with less than 10 percent
    disease prevalence (on the west side of the barrier) from the areas with more than
    10 percent disease prevalence (on the east side). FISP did not conduct any epidemic
    zone activities east of this barrier. Despite the clear distinction of the barrier
    for implementation activities, the disease had a mosaic pattern, implying that the
    barrier was imperfect at delineating CLYD prevalence levels. This feature aided
    our evaluation, because we were able to select comparison areas to the east of the
    barrier that had roughly the same qualifications for selection (baseline disease
    prevalence) as the treatment areas. Among a subset of the census enumeration areas
    (EAs) on both sides of the barrier that had less than 15 percent disease prevalence,
    we matched EAs based on distance from coast (which also proxies for distance to
    barrier) and baseline disease prevalence. This strategy was feasible in five out
    of the eight FISP districts. In the remaining three districts in the Nampula province,
    where the epidemic and endemic zone programs were combined and there was no barrier
    separating project areas, we relied on qualitative data to assess the project. nTo
    assess impact on outcomes related to household income coconut production and seedling
    survival, the unit of analysis was households. We sampled 800 households across
    24 treatment and 24 comparison EAs. After accounting for nonresponse, missing observations,
    and outliers, we obtained a study sample of 666 usable observations. For each household
    we gathered information on their pre-intervention demographic characteristics and
    information to measure the key outcomes: seedling survival, coconut production,
    and income. nTo assess the impact of FISP on disease prevalence, we surveyed 16,000
    trees that were sampled from the same enumeration areas as the household survey
    in the epidemic zones. We first identified the land area within the matched EAs
    that had tree cover, based on the 2008 aerial photography data. Within these areas,
    we randomly sampled 400 grids, each 100 by 100 meters, and within each grid we drew
    a sample of 40 trees in four clusters. For each tree in the grid, the tree enumerators
    visually inspected whether the tree was healthy; had only CLYD (and not beetle infestation);
    had beetle infestation only; or had CLYD and beetle infestation.  The enumerators
    assessed beetle infestation also because CLYD is closely associated with increase
    in beetle infestation since dead trees - dead because of CLYD - can become a breeding
    ground for beetles. nTo answer the question on FISP's impact on disease spread,
    however, we could not apply this method because that requires time series information
    on disease spread before, during, and after FISP. We conducted the analysis on two
    pairs of treatment and comparison areas for which we could find satellite data to
    estimate the prevalence of healthy trees between 2008 and 2014. nEvaluation of the
    Endemic Zone Program: In the endemic zones, which were entirely east of the phytosanitary
    barrier, the evaluation used a non-experimental method for selecting untreated geographic
    areas that, at baseline, were very similar to the treated areas. We matched pairs
    of treatment and comparison enumeration areas on baseline disease prevalence and
    distance from coast. The results of our matching and comparison of their self-reported
    pre-intervention characteristics suggest that the two groups are comparable and
    did not require any re-weighting to u201clook similar.u201dnIn the endemic zone,
    we surveyed 720 households in 80 EAs across all districts. Of the 720 households
    surveyed, 561 observations were usable. In addition to information gathered for
    the epidemic zone farmers, for endemic zone farmers we also gathered information
    on their adoption, production, and sale of crops promoted by FISP.nOther Questions:
    To answer other questions, including the assessment of the BDF activity, the R&D
    activity, and the adaptation and adherence of FISP implementation to project goals,
    we conducted a desktop review of the literature. In addition, for the BDF activities
    and assessment of FISP's adaptation and adherence to project goals, we conducted
    interviews with key stakeholders, and focus group discussions and interviews with
    farmers and grant recipients.n      ",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras":
