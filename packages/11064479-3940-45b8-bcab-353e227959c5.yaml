  files (.dbf) are an extract of selectedn          geographic and cartographic information
  from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
  Encoding and Referencingn          (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents
  a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line
  shapefile isn          designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they
  can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Census Blocks are statistical areas
  bounded on alln          sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams,
  and railroad tracks, and/or by non-visible boundaries such as city, town, township,
  and countyn          limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads.
  \ Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded
  byn          streets.  However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and
  irregular and may even be many square miles in area.  A common misunderstanding
  is thatn          data users think census blocks are used geographically to build
  all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are
  updated andn          then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and
  water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks.  As a result, all 2010 Census
  blocks nestn          within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census
  Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to
  then          appropriate geographic areas.  Census blocks cover all territory in
  the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, then
  \         Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands).
  \ Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishesn
  \         data from the decennial census.  A block may consist of one or more faces.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
