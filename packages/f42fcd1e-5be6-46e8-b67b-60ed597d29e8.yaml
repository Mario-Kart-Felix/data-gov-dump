  significant attention in the past few years.*Currently, prognostics concepts lack
  standard definitions and suffer from ambiguous and inconsistent interpretations.
  This lack of standards is in part due to the varied end- user requirements for different
  applications, time scales, available information, domain dynamics, etc. to name
  a few. The research community has used a variety of metrics largely based on convenience
  and their respective requirements. Very little attention has been focused on establishing
  a standardized approach to compare different efforts. This paper presents several
  new evaluation metrics tailored for prognostics that were recently introduced and
  were shown to effectively evaluate various algorithms as compared to other conventional
  metrics. Specifically, this paper presents a detailed discussion on how these metrics
  should be interpreted and used. These metrics have the capability of incorporating
  probabilistic uncertainty estimates from prognostic algorithms. In addition to quantitative
  assessment they also offer a comprehensive visual perspective that can be used in
  designing the prognostic system. Several methods are suggested to customize these
  metrics for different applications. Guidelines are provided to help choose one method
  over another based on distribution characteristics. Various issues faced by prognostics
  and its performance evaluation are discussed followed by a formal notational framework
  to help standardize subsequent developments.\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S. Government

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
