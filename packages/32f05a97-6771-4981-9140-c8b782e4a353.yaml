    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "This paper introduces a generic distributed
    prognostic health management (PHM) architecture with specific application to the
    electrical power systems domain. Current state-of-the-art PHM systems are mostly
    centralized in nature, where all the processing is reliant on a single processor.
    This can lead to loss of functionality in case of a crash of the central processor
    or monitor. Furthermore, with increases in the volume of sensor data as well as
    the complexity of algorithms, traditional centralized systems become unsuitable
    for successful deployment, and efficient distributed architectures are required.
    A distributed architecture though, is not effective unless there is an algorithmic
    framework to take advantage of its unique abilities. The health management paradigm
    envisaged here incorporates a heterogeneous set of system components monitored by
    a varied suite of sensors and a particle filtering (PF) framework that has the power
    and the flexibility to adapt to the different diagnostic and prognostic needs. Both
    the diagnostic and prognostic tasks are formulated as a particle filtering problem
    in order to explicitly represent and manage uncertainties; however, typically the
    complexity of the prognostic routine is higher than the computational power of one
    computational element (CE). Individual CEs run diagnostic routines until the system
    variable being monitored crosses beyond a nominal threshold, upon which it coordinates
    with other networked CEs to run the prognostic routine in a distributed fashion.
    Implementation results from a network of distributed embedded devices monitoring
    a prototypical aircraft electrical power system are presented, where the CEs are
    Sun Microsystems Small Programmable Object Technology (SPOT) devices.",nt"owner_org":
