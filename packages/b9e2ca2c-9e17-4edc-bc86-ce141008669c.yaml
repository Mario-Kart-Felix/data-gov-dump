    of approximately 400 raster-formatted data layers. It is available on a single CD-ROM
    in either EPPL7, or ERDAS and GeoTIFF formats. The data themes cover a wide range
    of physical and biological variables along with administrative, political, sociodemographic,
    and transportation data. The data collection unit for most of the variables is the
    40-acre parcel. Files have been subdivided into 100-meter by 100-meter grid cells
    and spatially corrected to provide improved geographic reference. However, this
    processing step does not improve the original 40-acre resolution accuracy. The data
    set is designed for use in regional and statewide planning, not for site-specific
    decision making. MGC100 is effectively the MLMIS100 county data set appended into
    a statewide coverage. There is also some 30-meter data for the Twin Cities metropolitan
    area on this CD.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
