    of California provide valuable habitat for many resident and migratory birds and
    are a very important component of the Salton Sea Ecosystem (Patten et. al. 2003),
    but detailed information regarding avian species use, distribution and abundance
    is lacking. In 2006 the California Department of Fish and Game, the Salton Sea Authority,
    and the USGS initiated a monthly survey of birds using Imperial Valley agriculture
    fields to provide information regarding avian species composition and use. Driving
    transects were originally delineated on a map as one continuous transect projected
    to cover a good representation of a subset of the entire Imperial Valley agriculture
    area. The original transect included mostly highways with heavy traffic and high
    speeds. It was decided for safety reasons that slower speed limits and lighter traffic
    areas would be more suitable to this type of survey. The result is two transects
    of roughly the same distance. The west transect is west of Highway 111, beginning
    at the junction of Highway 111 and Sinclair Road and ending on Harris Road and Butters
    Road. The east transect is east of Highway 111, beginning at the junction of Highway
    111 and Sinclair Road. and ending on Harris Road and Butters Road. See map for details
    http://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=4964 . Surveys began 30 minutes
    after sunrise on the west transect. The east transect was completed on the next
    consecutive day commencing at 30 minutes after sunrise. Driving speed was limited
    to 25 miles per hour where possible. When available, the survey was conducted with
    a driver and an observer. Many times the driver was alone and made all of the observations.
    As the vehicle followed the transect, fields on either side of the road were scanned
    for birds. When birds were observed in a field the vehicle was stopped and a GPS
    location was taken using a Magellan Sport Trac Topo. All bird species were counted
