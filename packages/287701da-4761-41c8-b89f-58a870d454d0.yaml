    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    whose goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of automated data mining and planning
    for the daily management of Earth Science missions. Currently, data mining and machine
    learning technologies are being used by scientists at research labs for validating
    Earth science models. However, few if any of these advancedtechniques are currently
    being integrated into daily mission operations. Consequently, there are significant
    gaps in the knowledge that can be derived from the models and data that are used
    each day for guiding mission activities. The result can be sub-optimal observation
    plans, lack of useful data, and wasteful use of resources. Recent advances in data
    mining, machine learning, and planning make it feasible to migrate these technologies
    into the daily mission planning cycle. This paper describes the design of a closed
    loop system for data acquisition, processing, and flight planning that integrates
    the results of machine learning into the flight planning process.",nt"owner_org":
