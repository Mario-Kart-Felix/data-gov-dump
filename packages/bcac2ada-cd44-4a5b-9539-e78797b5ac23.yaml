  GIS layer contains unique Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS) site records.
  These records have the following NPL_STATUS designations: CURRENTLY ON FINAL NPL,
  DELETED FROM FINAL NPL, NOT ON NPL, PROPOSED FOR NPL, REMOVED FROM PROPOSED NPL,
  and SITE IS PART OF NPL SITE. The Region 2 SEMS_CERCLIS NPL Sites [R2] GIS layer
  only has SEMS records with the following NPL_STATUS designations: 'CURRENTLY ON
  FINAL NPL', 'DELETED FROM FINAL NPL', 'PROPOSED FOR NPL'. The Superfund Enterprise
  Management System (SEMS) is EPA's \"official record\" for tracking hazardous waste
  sites, potentially hazardous waste sites, and remedial activities performed in support
  of the Superfund Program across the nation. This includes sites that are on the
  National Priorities List (NPL) or are being considered for the NPL. SEMS represents
  a joint development and ongoing collaboration between Superfund's Remedial, Removal,
  Federal Facilities, Enforcement, and Emergency Response programs. It provides its
  wide audience base with a means of ongoing analysis of Superfund Program activities
  and informational needs at the site, regional management, and national management
  levels. The customers of SEMS or SEMS data are five EPA Headquarters offices and
  regional staff, citizens, the regulated community, other Federal agencies, States,
  Tribes, local agencies, and industry. SEMS stakeholders are States, Congress, other
  Federal agencies, industry groups, and citizens. The informal partnerships established
  with Federal, State, local government, and industry groups are key to the reliability
  and tracking of environmental cleanup data and ultimate protection of human health
  and the environment. SEMS is an adaptive and tailored technical solution that is
  transforming the Superfund program by improving operational effectiveness, reducing
  costs, streamlining business processes, and enhancing information management capabilities.
  The solution serves as a model for how the Federal Government serves the public,
  the regulated community and partner agencies alike. All data for EPA Region 2 Regulated
  Facility GIS layers are extracted from the Facility Registry System (FRS) of Envirofacts
  on a monthly basis using R2GIS SQL procedures and Linked Server definitions. The
  attributes for each media specific R2GIS Regulated Facility layer provides the ID,
  name, address and environmental interest (permit designation or regulated activity)
  from the parent media program system and the best available coordinates from the
  FRS Geospatial Tables except for the Region 2 CERLIS layers were all locational
  data is from the CERCLIS database only. There are a small percentage of EPA Regulated
  Facilities for which no coordinate information has been registered in any of the
  related EPA or State Program System Databases. These facilities will have attribute
  table records in the Facility GIS layer but will not appear as points in the display
  map. For the much larger set of program system records with coordinates there may
  be a small subset of facilities having multiple records for the same facility in
  the layer. This can be due to multiple environmental interests registered over time
  for the same permit (e.g. AIR Major to Minor, RCRA Small Quantity Generator to Large
  Quantity Generator). A facility may also have been issued multiple program system
  IDs under the same EPA Program overtime. In either of these cases there will be
  more than one record with the same coordinates in a R2 Regulated Facility GIS layer
  and will result in stacked points on the GIS display.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\":
