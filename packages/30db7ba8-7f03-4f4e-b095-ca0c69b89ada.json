This network accommodates a dispersed growth pattern focused on roadways that are accessed primarily by the automobile, including 950 new miles of regional roadway and no new regional transit infrastructure. The network represents an extension of investment priorities that have occurred over the last 50-60 years. The routes are based on data from the Louisiana State Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) Statewide Transportation Plan. Projects include transportation investments identified in the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) and projects from local Metropolitan Planning Organization Master Transportation Plans (MTP). The Louisiana Speaks Regional Plan process study area includes the 35 southernmost parishes of Louisiana.",
