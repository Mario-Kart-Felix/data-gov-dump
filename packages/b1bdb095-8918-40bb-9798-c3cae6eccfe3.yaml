    the surficial geology for the area within the Standing Rock Indian Reservation,
    Sioux County, North Dakota, and Corson County, South Dakota. Identified units include:
    1) alluvium, terrace, outwash, colluvium, eolian deposits, and buried-valley fill;
    2) glacial till; 3) Fort Union Formation; 4) Hell Creek Formation; 5) Fox Hills
    Formation; and 6) Pierre Shale. The digital data were produced by the U.S. Geological
    Survey (USGS) in cooperation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Figure
    5 in Howells (1982) was scanned and digitized on-screen to create this coverage.
    See cross reference information for more detail. According to the map credit for
    figure 5, the geology for Sioux County was based on soil maps prepared by the U.S.
    Bureau of Indian Affairs (1959), data collected by Randich (1975), and a geologic
    map by Carlson (1978). The geology for Corson County was based on soil maps prepared
    by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs (1959) and unpublished maps of the U.S. Soil
    Conservation Service, modified by test drilling and field reconnaissance. The following
    definitions were used for figure 5. Alluvium, terrace, outwash, colluvium, eolian
    deposits, and buried-valley fill-- The small scale prevents differentiating these
    deposits on this map. Alluvium is water-laid material deposited on flood plains
    and valleys of rivers and streams. Most of the material is clay, silt, and fine
    sand but there is some coarser material. Terraces are older alluvial deposits that
    now are above the level of the flood plain because the stream has eroded its valley
    deeper since deposition of the sediment. Outwash was deposited in streams and lakes
    formed by melting glaciers. Maximum thickness of alluvium or outwash is less than
    120 feet; of terraces, more than 50 feet. Colluvium is landslide and slumpage detritus,
    commonly deposited at the foot of the steep slopes. The material usually is fragments
    of shale, silt, and sand, but may include gravel or sandstone cobbles from terraces
    or sandstone beds capping higher benches or buttes. Deposits may exceed 100 feet
    in thickness. Eolian deposits are windblown material, mostly silt and fine sand,
    but include some clay and, in some areas, much medium sand. Deposits are as much
    as 20 feet thick, but a thin coating, as little as a fraction of an inch thick,
    overlies most of the area. Buried valley fill is mostly glacial stream and outwash
    deposits but includes some till. The material is mostly moderately-sorted gravel,
    sand, silt, and clay. Maximum thickness locally exceeds 300 feet. Quaternary Period.
    Glacial till -- Deposited beneath or at the margins of the continental glaciers.
    The material is a heterogeneous mixture of sizes from clay to boulders. Maximum
    thickness probably is less than 40 feet. Quaternary Period. Fort Union Formation
    -- Gray to buff interbedded very fine to medium-grained sandstone, siltstone, claystone,
    silty clay, and shale; thin carbonaceous or lignitic beds near the base. Contains
    three widely persistent sandstone beds. Maximum thickness is greater than 400 feet.
    Tertiary Period. Hell Creek Formation -- Somber-colored, soft clay shale and buff
    to gray, weakly-cemented, coarse- to fine-grained sandstone and siltstone. Contains
    lignitic lenses and thin, black carbonaceous shale beds. Maximum thickness may be
    greater than 400 feet. Cretaceous Period. Fox Hills Formation -- Dark- to light-gray
    silty and sandy clay, clayey silt, and very fine-grained sandstone; overlain, in
    Corson County, by dark-gray to yellowish-orange, weakly-cemented, very fine-grained
    sandstone. The upper part of the formation is a thinly-bedded sequence of clay,
    silt, and sand, that contains discontinuous beds of silica-cemented very fine-grained
    sandstone. Contacts between the Hell Creek and Pierre Shale are gradational. Maximum
    thickness is about 400 feet. Cretaceous Period. Pierre Shale -- Gray to brown, tough,
    gummy to friable shale, noncalcareous to highly calcareous, contains widely persistent
    zones of bentonite and of iron manganese or limestone concretions. Where exposed
    at the surface, the top few feet commonly is weathered. Maximum thickness is about
    1,400 feet. Cretaceous Period.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
