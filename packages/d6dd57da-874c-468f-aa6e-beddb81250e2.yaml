    Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, from 20110407 to 20110509, belt transect surveys of coral population
    and diseases quantitative assessments were conducted, as a part of Rapid Ecological
    Assessments (REA), during the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP)
    cruise HA1101 in Marianas at biennial intervals by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division
    (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). During the
    cruise, there were 2 surveys in total conducted at REA sites around Aguijan. At
    the specific REA sites, coral biologists along with algal biologists and marine
    invertebrate zoologist entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (approximately
    300 m^2) and high degree of taxonomic resolution REA survey to assess and monitor
    species composition, abundance, percent cover, size distribution, diversity, and
    general health of corals, macro-invertebrates, and algae in shallow-water (less
    than 35 m) habitats. As a part of REA surveys, the coral belt surveys were focused
    on quantifying the diversity, abundance, density, and size-class distribution of
    the anthozoan and hydrozoan corals as well as the condition and health state of
    the coral reef populations. The surveys were conducted along two consecutively-placed,
    25 m transect lines. The belt width was 1 m wide, 0.5 m on each side of the transect
    line. Within each 25 m transect, five 2.5 m segments were surveyed (beginning at
    points: 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 meters), whereby in each segment, all coral colonies
    whose center fell within 0.5 m of either side of the transect line were identified
    to the lowest taxonomic level possible (genus or species) and two planar size metrics
    were collected: maximum diameter and diameter perpendicular to the maximum diameter.
    In addition, the extent of mortality, both recent and old, was estimated for each
    colony. Observers paid special attention to identifying as best as possible the
    extent of the former live colony. When a coral colony exhibited signs of disease
    or compromised health, additional information was recorded including type of affliction
    (bleaching, skeletal growth anomaly, white syndrome, tissue loss other than white
    syndrome, trematodiasis, necrosis, other, pigmentation responses, algal overgrowth,
    and predation), severity of the affliction (mild, moderate, marked, severe, acute),
    as well as photographic documentation and occasional tissue samples. Tissue samples
    were cataloged and fixed in buffered zinc-formalin solution for further histopathological
    analyses. Raw survey data included species presence and relative abundance, colony
    counts per taxon, size (width and length), mortality, predation, and health status.
    A surveyed area was ranging from 10 m^2 to 25 m^2 per site.",nt"license_title":
