  of a joint NESDIS-NMFS project aimed at advancing the understanding of the occurrence,
  abundance, and outbreak of coral bleaching and disease in the Hawaiian Archipelago
  through expanded field surveys and in-situ and remotely-sensed temperature data.
  To this end Line-Point-Intercept (LPI), belt-transect surveys of coral population,
  and diseases quantitative assessments were conducted on MAUI in the MAIN HAWAIIAN
  ISLANDS by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands
  Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) and partners. At the specific sites, coral biologists
  conducted Line-Point-Intercept (LPI) and coral belt surveys, focused at quantifying
  the composition, relative abundance, density, and size-class distribution of the
  anthozoan and hydrozoan corals, as well as the condition and health state of the
  coral populations. The surveys were conducted along two consecutively-placed, 25m
  transect lines. The LPI surveys documented the composition of the coral reef community
  at 25 or 50cm intervals, for 50 or 100 points per transect. The belt width was 1-m
  wide (0.5-m on each side of the transect line), for community structure assessments,
  and 2-m wide (1.0-m on each side of the transect line), for coral condition and
  health surveys. Within each 25m transect, up to 15, 1.0-meter segments were surveyed,
  whereby in each segment, all coral colonies whose center fell within 0.5m of either
  side of the transect line were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible
  (genus or species) and colony size visually estimated and binned by its maximum
  diameter in one of 7 size classes: 0-5cm, 5-10cm, 10-20cm, 20-40cm, 40-80cm, 80-160cm,
  or >160cm. When a coral colony exhibited signs of disease or compromised health,
  additional information was recorded including type of affliction (bleaching, skeletal
  growth anomaly, white syndrome, tissue loss other than white syndrome, trematodiasis,
  necrosis, other, pigmentation responses, algal overgrowth, and predation), severity
  of the affliction (mild, moderate, marked, severe, acute), as well as photographic
  documentation and sometimes tissue samples. Raw survey data included species presence
  and relative abundance, colony counts per taxon, size (width and length), mortality,
  predation, and health status. The surveyed area ranged from 25m2 to 50m2 per site.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
