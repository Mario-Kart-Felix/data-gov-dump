  Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
  reef ecosystems, from 20110407 to 20110509, belt transect surveys of coral population
  and diseases quantitative assessments were conducted, as a part of Rapid Ecological
  Assessments (REA), during the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP)
  cruise HA1101 in Marianas at biennial intervals by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division
  (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). During the
  cruise, there were 6 surveys in total conducted at REA sites around Tinian. At the
  specific REA sites, coral biologists along with algal biologists and marine invertebrate
  zoologist entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (approximately 300 m^2) and
  high degree of taxonomic resolution REA survey to assess and monitor species composition,
  abundance, percent cover, size distribution, diversity, and general health of corals,
  macro-invertebrates, and algae in shallow-water (less than 35 m) habitats. As a
  part of REA surveys, the coral belt surveys were focused on quantifying the diversity,
  abundance, density, and size-class distribution of the anthozoan and hydrozoan corals
  as well as the condition and health state of the coral reef populations. The surveys
  were conducted along two consecutively-placed, 25 m transect lines. The belt width
  was 1 m wide, 0.5 m on each side of the transect line. Within each 25 m transect,
  five 2.5 m segments were surveyed (beginning at points: 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 meters),
  whereby in each segment, all coral colonies whose center fell within 0.5 m of either
  side of the transect line were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible
  (genus or species) and two planar size metrics were collected: maximum diameter
  and diameter perpendicular to the maximum diameter. In addition, the extent of mortality,
  both recent and old, was estimated for each colony. Observers paid special attention
  to identifying as best as possible the extent of the former live colony. When a
  coral colony exhibited signs of disease or compromised health, additional information
  was recorded including type of affliction (bleaching, skeletal growth anomaly, white
  syndrome, tissue loss other than white syndrome, trematodiasis, necrosis, other,
  pigmentation responses, algal overgrowth, and predation), severity of the affliction
  (mild, moderate, marked, severe, acute), as well as photographic documentation and
  occasional tissue samples. Tissue samples were cataloged and fixed in buffered zinc-formalin
  solution for further histopathological analyses. Raw survey data included species
  presence and relative abundance, colony counts per taxon, size (width and length),
  mortality, predation, and health status. A surveyed area was ranging from 10 m^2
  to 25 m^2 per site.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819\",\n\t\"extras\":
