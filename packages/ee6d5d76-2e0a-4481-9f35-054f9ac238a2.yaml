    Addition of flywheels to space flight exercise hardware in order to simulate free
    weight inertia increases wear on equipment and has resulted in costly repairs to
    exercise hardware in space. Ground based exercise studies have shown improved bone
    density and muscle strength with exercise equipment that use pneumatic resistance
    forces and have no added inertial forces beyond that derived from the mass of the
    human body.&amp;nbsp; An exhaustive literature search revealed no direct comparisons
    between pneumatic resistance exercise devices and weight stack or free weight exercises
    used to maintain or strengthen bone and muscle. In the absence of a direct comparison,
    exercise prescriptions and exercise equipment requirements specifying simulation
    of weight stack type rate dependent variability in forces on the ARED for health
    maintenance have been based upon opinion. Use of weight stack exercise equipment
    and flywheels to simulate weight stack characteristics reduces loads below the target
    level in up to half of the weight lifting cycle, results in poorly controlled rate
    dependent variability in loads, and can induce injurious peak loads. This variability
    undermines the exercise requirements for constant load with a high eccentric to
    concentric load ratio agreed upon by musculoskeletal and exercise scientists who
    defined ARED requirements for ISS. Numerous studies in the literature show exercise
    equipment that provides high concentric and eccentric loads improves bone density
    and muscle strength, with and without transient loads due to mass moment of inertia.
    Despite low levels of evidence&amp;nbsp; that impact&amp;nbsp; (separate from high
    sustained loads) is beneficial to bone and muscle, many exercise guidelines continue
    to state impact is desirable for bone maintenance. Impact is contraindicated in
    individuals with arthritis and joint injuries. Therefore, use of the ISS ARED to
    demonstrate that high constant loads without transient loads maintains bone and
    muscle will be beneficial to NASA in simplifying hardware design and maintenance
    and will improve exercise safety. Information generated in this proposed activity
    will be used to support&amp;nbsp; exercise improvements that will enhance durability,
    safety, and efficiency of exercise hardware for space flight.&lt;/p&gt;rn",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
