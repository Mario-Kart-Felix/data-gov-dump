    categories (High, Moderate, Low, and Non-Habitat) derived from a composite, continuous
    surface of sage-grouse habitat suitability index (HSI) values for Nevada and northeastern
    California during spring, which is a surrogate for habitat conditions during the
    sage-grouse breeding and nesting period. Summary of steps to create Habitat Categories:
    HABITAT SUITABILITY INDEX: The HSI was derived from a generalized linear mixed model
    (specified by binomial distribution) that contrasted data from multiple environmental
    factors at used sites (telemetry locations) and available sites (random locations).
    Predictor variables for the model represented vegetation communities at multiple
    spatial scales, water resources, habitat configuration, urbanization, roads, elevation,
    ruggedness, and slope. Vegetation data was derived from various mapping products,
    which included NV SynthMap (Petersen 2008, SageStitch (Comer et al. 2002, LANDFIRE
    (Landfire 2010), and the CA Fire and Resource Assessment Program (CFRAP 2006). The
    analysis was updated to include high resolution percent cover within 30 x 30 m pixels
    for Sagebrush, non-sagebrush, herbaceous vegetation, and bare ground (C. Homer,
    unpublished; based on the methods of Homer et al. 2014, Xian et al. 2015 ) and conifer
    (primarily pinyon-juniper, P. Coates, unpublished). The pool of telemetry data included
    the same data from 1998 - 2013 used by Coates et al. (2014); additional telemetry
    location data from field sites in 2014 were added to the dataset. The dataset was
    then split according calendar date into three seasons (spring, summer, winter).
    Spring included telemetry locations (n = 14,058) from mid-March to June, and is
    a surrogate for habitat conditions during the sage-grouse breeding and nesting period.
    All age and sex classes of marked grouse were used in the analysis. Sufficient data
    (i.e., a minimum of 100 locations from at least 20 marked Sage-grouse) for modeling
    existed in 10 subregions for spring and summer, and seven subregions in winter,
    using all age and sex classes of marked grouse. It is important to note that although
    this map is composed of HSI values derived from the seasonal data, it does not explicitly
    represent habitat suitability for reproductive females (i.e., nesting). Insufficient
    data were available to allow for estimation of this habitat type for all seasons
    throughout the study area extent. A Resource Selection Function (RSF) was calculated
    for each subregion and using generalized linear models to derive model-averaged
    parameter estimates for each covariate across a set of additive models. Subregional
    RSFs were transformed into Habitat Suitability Indices, and averaged together to
    produce an overall statewide HSI whereby a relative probability of occurrence was
    calculated for each raster cell during the spring season. In order to account for
    discrepancies in HSI values caused by varying ecoregions within Nevada, the HSI
    was divided into north and south extents using a slightly modified flood region
    boundary (Mason 1999) that was designed to represent respective mesic and xeric
    regions of the state. North and south HSI rasters were each relativized according
    to their maximum value to rescale between zero and one, then mosaicked once more
    into a state-wide extent. HABITAT CATEGORIZATION: Using the same ecoregion boundaries
    described above, the habitat classification dataset (an independent data set comprising
    10% of the total telemetry location sample) was split into locations falling within
    respective north and south regions. HSI values from the composite and relativized
    statewide HSI surface were then extracted to each classification dataset location
    within the north and south region. The distribution of these values were used to
    identify class break values corresponding to 0.5 (high), 1.0 (moderate), and 1.5
    (low) standard deviations (SD) from the mean HSI. These class breaks were used to
    classify the HSI surface into four discrete categories of habitat suitability: High,
    Moderate, Low, and Non-Habitat. In terms of percentiles, High habitat comprised
    greater than 30.9 % of the HSI values, Moderate comprised 15 u00e2u0080u0093 30.9%,
    Low comprised 6.7 u00e2u0080u0093 15%, and Non-Habitat comprised less than 6.7%.The
    classified north and south regions were then clipped by the boundary layer and mosaicked
    to create a statewide categorical surface for habitat selection. Each habitat suitability
    category was converted to a vector output where gaps within polygons less than 1.2
    million square meters were eliminated, polygons within 500 meters of each other
    were connected to create corridors and polygons less than 1.2 million square meters
    in one category were incorporated to the adjacent category. The final step was to
    mask major roads that were buffered by 50m (Census, 2014), lakes (Peterson, 2008)
    and urban areas, and place those masked areas into the non-habitat category. The
    existing urban layer (Census 2010) was not sufficient for our needs because it excluded
    towns with a population lower than 1,500. Hence, we masked smaller towns (populations
    of 100 to 1500) and development with Census Block polygons (Census 2015) that had
    at least 50% urban development within their boundaries when viewed with reference
    imagery (ArcGIS World Imagery Service Layer). REFERENCES: California Forest and
