    backscatter mosaic of a reef shelf/bank and the steep slopes and canyons of the
    NE Reserve, offshore of Fajardo, Puerto Rico. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography
    Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and
    private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the Northeast Reserve
    during 2012 and 2013. Data was acquired with a Hull mounted Kongsberg EM1002 multibeam
    echosounder (95 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software,
    applying all relevant correctors (attitude, sound velocity, absorption coefficient).
    Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The backscatter component of the bathymetry
    data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected in CARIS HIPS Mosaic Editor.
    Acoustic backscatter mosaics are an important piece of information when characterizing
    surficial seafloor features and delineating benthic habitats. The project was conducted
    to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and
    depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according
    to their own needs and standards.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
