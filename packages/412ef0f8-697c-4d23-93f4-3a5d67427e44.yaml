    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;Using biologically-inspired neuromorphic
    optic flow algorithms is a novel approach in collision avoidance for UAS. Traditional
    computer vision algorithms rely on solving nonlinear partial differential equation
    systems to estimate optic flow which is a computationally expensive task. Neuromorphic
    algorithms instead make use of lessons learned in biology to solve these problems
    in a more efficient manner. An example is the fly&amp;#39;s motion detector, which
    can be modeled by a system that uses a set of locally calculated, parallel spatio-temporal
    correlations for a set of velocities determined by the input sampling rates and
    flying speeds. Correlation results are interpreted as likelihood for a motion direction
    and speed. Stages of obstacle detection and tracking can temporally and spatially
    integrate these likelihoods to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and in turn the
    detection rate. In addition to its computational efficiency, the proposed neuromorphic
    solution is more stable and noise tolerant than solving a nonlinear optimization
    problem. Even if single computational nodes get corrupted due to functional or structural
    failures in the hardware, the performance of appropriately designed parallel, distributed
    neuromorphic algorithms degrades gracefully. Neuromorphic algorithms are commonly
    implemented using software running on general-purpose multicore/graphic processing
    unit systems. This approach, though flexible, can have significant overhead in terms
    of power, performance, and is not easily portable across platforms, therefore reducing
    its scope of applicability. In the second phase, we will port the neuromorphic algorithms
    to field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application specific integrated chips
    (ASICs). This will allow us to meet demanding performance requirements needed in
    UAS such as fast processing, low weight, low power consumption, as well as robustness
    to hardware failure.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
