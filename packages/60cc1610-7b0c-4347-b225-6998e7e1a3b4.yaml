  unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
  thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
  years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
  we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
  to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
  in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
  to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
  air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
  Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
  spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
  explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
  and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
  rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
  expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
  NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
  to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
  around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
  continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
  Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
  Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
  such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"title\": \"National

  organic soil carbon and nitrogen data set (Zinke et al. 1986). The subset was created
  for the study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia
  (LBA) in South America (i.e., 10 N to 25 S, 30 to 85 W). The point data are available
  in three formats: a comma-delimited ASCII file (*.csv), an ESRI shapefile, and an
  ESRI export file (*.e00).The data for the global data set (Zinke et al. 1986) were
  obtained from soil surveys conducted by Zinke in 1965-1984 and from soil survey
  literature. The main samples for laboratory analyses were collected at uniform soil
  increments and included bulk density determinations. Many samples reported in the
  literature did not have uniform soil increments or bulk density determinations.
  Only soil profiles that had been sampled either to a meter in depth or to actual
  depth were included in this database from soil survey literature. When carbon content
  was known but bulk densities were absent from soil samples reported in the literature,
  densities were estimated by regression analysis on the basis of the relationship
  between organic carbon content and measured bulk density in 1800 soil profiles for
  which bulk densities were known.Further information can be found at ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/lba/carbon_dynamics/Zinke_soil/comp/zinke_readme.pdf.LBA
  was a cooperative international research initiative led by Brazil. NASA was a lead
  sponsor for several experiments. LBA was designed to create the new knowledge needed
  to understand the climatological, ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological functioning
  of Amazonia; the impact of land use change on these functions; and the interactions
  between Amazonia and the Earth system. More information about LBA can be found at
