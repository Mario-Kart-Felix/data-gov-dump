    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;A total containment NTP exhaust
    system has been conceptually engineered, however, since this a completely novel
    approach to address the numerous issues associated with fully containing exhaust
    from and NTP rocket engine test, to date, no experimental proof-of-concept has been
    conducted for this innovative technological approach.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Therefore,
    to demonstrate proof-of-concept, this project will develop the preliminary engineering
    design for a subscale demonstration for a full exhaust containment system.&amp;nbsp;
    To accomplish this, a closed system of ducts and vessels will be used, and liquid
    oxygen (LOX) will be injected into the hot hydrogen exhaust to convert it into steam,
    which will then be condensed and stored as liquid water.&amp;nbsp; Any particulates
    present, due to sub-optimal engine operation, will either be caught in a particle
    trap, or end up in water storage vessels, which will store the water indefinitely
    until fission products either decay, or are filtered, and ultimately can be safely
    discharged.&amp;nbsp; Gaseous oxygen and any noble gas fission products will then
    be condensed in a cryogenic heat exchanger and stored in a chilled jacketed Dewar
    as LOX, and any residual noble gasses, if present, will solidify and can remain
    stored in the Dewar indefinitely, until the gases have decayed and can safely be
    released.&amp;nbsp; In this way, all possible fission products that could result
    from an NTP engine ground test would be captured and stored, and subsequently evaluated
    and assessed for radioactive contamination and handled accordingly, as needed, over
    an indefinite period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The components for this system will
    incorporate additional design elements that are currently in&amp;nbsp;development
    that will be integrated with the overall design concept. Valuable data collected
    from these separate design components would then feed into the development cycle
    of a full scale NTP ground test facility based on outcomes of the subscale concept.&amp;nbsp;
    The subscale technology demonstrator could ultimately serve as a non-nuclear test
    bed for NTP ground test facility system components and instrumentation, and would
    prove to be an invaluable resource for use during the design for a full scale NTP
    ground test facility.&amp;nbsp; The goal of the project is to better prepare and
    align NASA SSC for successful participation in developing safe, affordable NTP technologies
    for future manned space flight travel. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
