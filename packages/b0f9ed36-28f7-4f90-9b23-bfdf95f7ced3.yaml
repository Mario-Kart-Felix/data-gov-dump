    place to assess coral resilence and the resilence of communities to climate change:nnClimate
    and resilience-based decision-support tools to maximize coral transplant survivorship
    and reef recovery in Florida: There are currently at least 7 coral nurseries in
    Florida that cultivate the ESA-listed u00e2u0080u0098threatenedu00e2u0080u0099 Acropora
    cervicornis. These thousands of corals represent great monetary and labor investments
    (~75k/y for UM alone) and one of our best opportunities to maintain resilient populations
    of this species. Ideally, these corals should be out-planted to locations where
    the conditions are most favorable for long-term survival. This collaborative applied
    research project will ensure nursery operators and Florida reef managers have access
    to maps presenting a scheme for identifying and ranking candidate sites that accounts
    for ocean acidification and includes downscaled coral bleaching projections.nnElucidating
    the recipe for coral reef resilience in the Florida Keys: This project will take
    advantage of the 2015 mass coral bleaching event in the Florida Keys to field test
    the five hypotheses for why the inshore patch reefs have had resilience to the region-wide
    loss in coral cover. Data collected will determine if this is a result of: 1) thermal
    acclimatization/adaption, 2) shading from high turbidity leading to depressed bleaching,
    3) increased heterotrophy, 4) heat-resistant zooxanthellae, and/or 5) elevated aragonite
    saturation states. This will yield valuable insights for coral reef managers as
    they work to conserve these resources with climate change and ocean acidification.
    nnSocial-ecological vulnerability assessment of reef fisheries and communities to
    promote climate resiliency in American Samoa: This project will develop a social-ecological
    climate change vulnerability assessment of coastal communities and coral reef fisheries
    in Tutuila, American Samoa, focusing on American Samoau00e2u0080u0099s two priority
    watersheds (Vatia and Faga'alu).  Depending on the quality of existing data and
    level of funding, we will analyze up to 4 additional sites as feasible.  Information
    on vulnerability and resilience will be presented to local agencies and communities
    to be incorporated into existing management plans and processes, utilizing PLA to
    raise community awareness and identify adaptation strategies at the community level.nnIdentifying
    coral reef resilience potential in American Samoa based on CRED coral reef monitoring
    data: This project will address a jurisdictional management priority in American
    Samoa by evaluating the resilience of coral reefs to the effects of climate change
    and other stressors. We will address this need by completing a Reef Resilience Assessment
    (RRA) for priority management areas around Tutuila relative to reef conditions island-wide.
    This RRA will provide managers with information needed to target conservation efforts
    to maximize the resilience of reef communities. The results of this project will
    also support the upcoming revision of the "Local Response to Climate Change" initiative
    of the Local Action Strategies of American Samoa.nnAssessing coral reef resilience
    along the South Kohala Coast of Hawaii: NOAA, Hawaii's DLNR and external partners
    are collaborating on a reef resilience assessment for the West Hawaii Habitat Focus
    Area, with support from CRCP in FY15. FY15 funding includes the data collection
    and analysis of 40 sites for indicators of resilience. The FY16 proposal includes
    an outreach strategy to interpret the results from the FY15 funded work with local
    resource managers, policy makers and community members, to facilitate the implementation
    of management recommendations. This comprehensive strategy is critical in order
    to make the information usable and to work with managers and policy makers to support
    changes in management actions.nnClimate Change Vulnerability Analysis for US Pacific
    Reefs - Integrating Exposure, Resilience, and Social Adaptive Capacity: This project
    will synthesize existing assessments and gap-fill using existing and developing
    datasets to generate a regional-scale full climate change vulnerability assessment
    of US Pacific coral reef resources, spanning exposure, resilience, and social adaptive
    capacity. Specifically,we will include (a) measures and projections of reef exposure
    to anthropogenic threats, (b) estimates of reef capacity for resistance to and recovery
    from said threats (aka. resilience), and (c) in populated areas, estimates of social
    adaptive capacity to manage. This three-stage analysis will be guided by experts
    in both biological vulnerability assessment, and social vulnerability assessment.",nt"license_title":
