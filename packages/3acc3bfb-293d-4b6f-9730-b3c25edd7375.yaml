    set contains all CalWater 2.2.1 Planning Watersheds (PWS) where DFG has documented
    coho salmon to be present during or after 1990. It was developed for the express
    purpose of assisting with Coho salmon recovery planning efforts. NOTE: Acreages
    are calculated for area inside California only. It is important to note that this
    data set does not attempt to model the entire possible distribution of the species.
    Rather, it only represents planning watersheds intersecting the known distribution,
    which is based on where the species has been observed and reported. While the distribution
    data may indeed represent the extent of the species, generally the upstream extent
    of the distribution only represents the location of positive sampling or other observations..
    Therefore, this data set likely represents an underestimation of the absolute geographic
    distribution of the species. Data Source: This watershed level data set was derived
    by intersecting Calwater planning watersheds with point and line features depicting
    Coho salmon distribution. These features are derived from a subset of data contained
    in the Aquatic Species Observation Database (ASOD), a Microsoft Access multi-species
    observation data capture application. ASOD is an ongoing project developed by the
    California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), Northern Region, Environmental Resources
    Information Services with assistance from CDFG Biogeographic Data Branch and Pacific
    States Marine Fisheries Commission. These data are based upon confirmed observations
    of Coho salmon. Effort has been made to identify and correct watersheds that were
    erroneously selected due to inaccuracies from using data of different scales. The
    observation data that are the basis for the distribution were compiled from a variety
    of disparate sources including but not limited to CDFG, U.S. Forest Service, National
    Marine Fisheries Service, timber companies, and the public. Forms of documentation
    include CDFG administrative reports, personal communications with biologists, observation
    reports, and literature reviews. This derived dataset is meant to be continually
    updated as additional information is acquired. As such, any copy of this dataset
    is considered to be a snapshot of the known Coho Distribution at the time of release.
    It is incumbent upon the user to ensure that they have the most recent version prior
    to making management or planning decisions. Data Usage: Examples of appropriate
    uses include: Coho salmon recovery planning Evaluation of future survey sites for
    Coho Validating Coho distribution models Examples of inappropriate uses include:
    Using this data to make parcel or ground level land use management decisions. Using
    this data set to prove or support non-existence of coho at any spatial scale. Assuming
    that Coho are prevalent throughout the entire watershed. All users of this data
    should seek the assistance of qualified professionals such as surveyors, hydrologists,
    or fishery biologists as needed to ensure that such users possess complete, precise,
    and up to date information on Coho salmon distribution and water body location.
