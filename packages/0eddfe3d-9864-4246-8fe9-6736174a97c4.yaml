  Fish Refuges Complex stretches along 124 miles of the Illinois River in west central
  Illinois. The Complex includes three refuges: Chautauqua National Wildlife Refuge
  (NWR), Emiquon NWR, and Meredosia NWR. The three refuges, which together total nearly
  13,000 acres, are a mix of backwater lakes, bottomland forests, floodplain wetlands
  and a small amount of upland forest and prairie. The Illinois River Refuge Complex
  originated in 1936 with the establishment of Chautauqua NWR for the main purpose
  of providing sanctuary for the millions of birds that migrate along the Illinois
  River. As the Refuge Complex grew with the addition of Meredosia NWR in 1973 and
  Emiquon NWR in 1993, the purpose expanded to include the conservation of wetlands,
  natural resources, as well as endangered or threatened species. Today, the refuge
  complex plays an important role in conservation of the Illinois River corridor and
  is one of the only sanctuary areas for waterfowl along the river during hunting
  season. The refugeu2019s priority resources of concern (ROC) were identified by
  using a structured selection process, including a review of species of concern identified
  in international, national, regional and local conservation plans and analyzing
  their relation to the biological integrity, diversity, and environmental health
  (BIDEH) of the refuge habitats. Through this selection process, the refuge identified
  15 priority species for which the refuge will actively manage habitat and monitor.
  Priority species were selected to serve as indicators and representatives for other
  important species and groups that may utilize similar habitat. As part of our ROC
  selection, we also evaluated and identified a diversity of habitat types for future
  management that support priority ROC or provide rare natural communities. Seasonal
  wetland, bottomland forest, and upland forest habitat types were selected by the
  planning team as priorities for habitat management. The ROC selection and prioritization
  process is discussed in detail within chapter 3. The HMP builds upon the goals,
  objectives, and strategies identified in the Illinois River Refuge Complex Comprehensive
  Conservation Plan (CCP) completed in 2004. As part of our HMP planning process,
  the planning team determined that it was necessary to combine numerous objectives
  under the Habitat and Wildlife Goals and add specificity as outlined by the Serviceu2019s
  Writing Goals and Objectives Handbook (Adamcik et al. 2004). These updated objectives
  and their relation to the 2004 CCP goals and objectives are discussed further in
  Chapter 4. The HMP also prioritizes strategies and specific units for focusing management.
  This identification of strategies and their prioritization was the result of the
  planning teamu2019s close evaluation of priority resource needs and associated management
  objectives. In doing so, we considered the logistical and biological needs for resources
  across all refuges, divisions, and their management units. We also outlined which
  strategies are capable of being completed by existing refuge resources and contrasted
  those with others requiring additional resource inputs in order to achieve the refugeu2019s
  biological goals and objectives over the next 15 years.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"4d7ad1cd-3641-420b-8116-e4082f49cd44\",\n\t\"extras\":
