  place to address aspects of coral reef conservation:nnEnhancing Management of Pacific
  ESA-listed Corals with Improved Utility of Existing Data and Automated Image Analysis:
  This project aims to enhance the management of Pacific corals listed under the Endangered
  Species Act by combining recent imagery collected from the Coral Reef Ecosystem
  Program's island-wide benthic towed-diver surveys conducted on the 2014 Mariana
  Archipelago RAMP (HA1401) and 2015 American Samoa RAMP (HA1501) cruises with emerging
  automated image analysis technology to provide important information on the location
  of hard and soft substrates and cover of hard corals to aid in the management and
  recovery of the listed species by the Protected Resources Division of the NMFS Pacific
  Islands Regional Office.nnEconomic Value of Ecosystem Services for Recreation-Tourism
  on the Reefs of Southeast Florida: This project will estimate the regional economic
  impact and the non-market economic value of the coral reefs of the Southeast Florida
  Reef Tract. Economic values will be estimated for recreation (including tourist)
  uses of the reefs and the change in value under varying reef conditions (e.g. improved
  species diversity, degraded reef condition, etc.) using a stated preference survey.
  \ Economic impacts will be estimated from existing survey data held by NMFS using
  IMPLAN modeling software. nnQuantifying extinction risk for ESA-listed coral species
  in the Wider Caribbean: The purpose of our project is to help managers plan for
  the future of their coral reef communities by (1) estimating the risk of and time
  to extinction for several reef-building coral species, (2) predicting changes in
  coral population size under various climate and restoration scenarios, and (3) providing
  ESA-mandated evaluations of population status and trends. We will make these predictions
  by generating population models for Caribbean coral species listed under the Endangered
  Species Act (ESA).   nnEvaluation of ESA listed Acropora spp. Status and Recovery
  Actions: This project addresses high priority recovery actions for ESA listed Acropora
  spp. in the Florida Keys, including both ongoing monitoring and finite population
  enhancement research. A.palmata populations in the upper Florida Keys and Curacao
  will be monitored for population performance metrics including recruitment and mortality.
  We will also lead development of an explicit A.palmata enhancement strategy for
  Florida and conduct high priority pilot experiments on outplanting density, habitat
  type, and/or genotypic enhancement to provide evaluation of various enhancement
  strategies.nnInvestigating How Coral Recruitment and Juvenile Survivorship Varies
  Along the Florida Reef Tract: This project will characterize coral recruitment and
  juvenile survivorship across the Florida Reef Tract and use a combination of methods
  to compare settlement rates on tiles and natural reef substrate. The study will
  elucidate species specific patterns of recruitment and assess temporal, spatial
  and physical parameters that may facilitate various levels of recruitment. The study
  will identify \"recruitment hotspots\" that will aid management efforts and will
  assist restoration efforts by prioritizing coral species or reef locations that
  indicate an inadequate ability to recover naturally.  nnUse of Restoration Genomics
  in Recovering ESA Species: Orbicella faveolata: Conservation efforts using coral
  nurseries and outplantings have been implemented to restore declining Caribbean
  reefs. Successful restoration occurs if genotypes in the source population perform
  adequately in the transplanted one. This project applies recently developed genomic
  tools to assist in the restoration efforts of NOAA with the Orbicella coral nursery
  in Culebra (NOAA HFA). The holdings will be genotyped and reciprocal transplants
  (wild) conducted to evaluate local population adaptations and their flexibility
  in acclimation potential. Understanding these traits provides managers with information
  for selecting nursery stock, selecting outplant sites and understanding genotype
  interchangeability across habitats for restoration. nnCoral restoration in natural
  ocean acidification refugia: Recent evidence suggests that South Florida seagrasses
  reduce the concentration of CO2 in surrounding waters. The purpose of this study
  is to evaluate the potential for these natural refugia to enhance the growth of
  ESA-listed Acropora cervicornis to be out-planted for restoration purposes. In-house
  instrumentation and water chemistry analysis will be used to monitor 11 collaborating
  coral nursery and restoration operations, representing significant cost savings.
  Elevated growth rates due to naturally high aragonite saturation states would increase
  the efficiency of restoration activities and allow for the advancement of these
  operations despite the ongoing deleterious effects of ocean acidification.nnClimate
  Change Vulnerability Analysis for US Pacific Reefs - Integrating Exposure, Resilience,
  and Social Adaptive Capacity: This project will synthesize existing assessments
  and gap-fill using existing and developing datasets to generate a regional-scale
  full climate change vulnerability assessment of US Pacific coral reef resources,
  spanning exposure, resilience, and social adaptive capacity. Specifically,we will
  include (a) measures and projections of reef exposure to anthropogenic threats,
  (b) estimates of reef capacity for resistance to and recovery from said threats
  (aka. resilience), and (c) in populated areas, estimates of social adaptive capacity
  to manage. This three-stage analysis will be guided by experts in both biological
  vulnerability assessment, and social vulnerability assessment.n\",\n\t\"license_title\":
