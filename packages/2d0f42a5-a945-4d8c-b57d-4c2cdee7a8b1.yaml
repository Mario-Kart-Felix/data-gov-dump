    of the CalFish Adult Salmonid Abundance Database. Data in this shapefile are collected
    from stream sections or reaches where Chinook population monitoring occurs and that
    are best represented by linear features. Some escapement monitoring locations are
    logically represented by point features, such as dams and hatcheries. See the companion
    point feature shapefile 'ds180_Chinook_pnts' for information collected from point
    locations.The CalFish Abundance Database contains a comprehensive collection of
    anadromous fisheries abundance information. Beginning in 1998, the Pacific States
    Marine Fisheries Commission, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the
    National Marine Fisheries Service, began a cooperative project aimed at collecting,
    archiving, and entering into standardized electronic formats, the wealth of information
    generated by fisheries resource management agencies and tribes throughout California.The
    data format provides for sufficient detail to convey the relative accuracy of each
    population trend index record yet is simple and straight forward enough to be suited
    for public use. For those interested in more detail the database offers hyperlinks
    to digital copies of the original documents used to compile the information. In
    this way the database serves as an information hub directing the user to additional
    supporting information. This offers utility to field biologists and others interested
    in obtaining information for more in-depth analysis. Hyperlinks, built into the
    spatial data attribute tables used in the BIOS and CalFish I-map viewers, open the
    detailed index data archived in the on-line CalFish database application. The information
    can also be queried directly from the database via the CalFish Tabular Data Query.
    Once the detailed annual trend data are in view, another hyperlink opens a digital
    copy of the document used to compile each record.During 2010, as a part of the Central
    Valley Chinook Comprehensive Monitoring Plan, the CalFish Salmonid Abundance Database
    was reorganized and updated. CalFish provides a central location for sharing Central
    Valley Chinook salmon escapement estimates and annual monitoring reports to all
    stakeholders, including the public. Annual Chinook salmon in-river escapement indices
    that were, in many cases, eight to ten years behind are now current though 2009.
    In some cases, multiple datasets were consolidated into a single, more comprehensive,
    dataset to more closely reflect how data are reported in the California Department
    of Fish and Game standard index, Grandtab.Extensive data are currently available
    in the CalFish Abundance Database for California Chinook, coho, and steelhead. Major
    data categories include adult abundance population estimates, actual fish and/or
    carcass counts, counts of fish collected at dams, weirs, or traps, and redd counts.
    Harvest data has also been compiled for many streams.This CalFish Abundance Database
    shapefile was generated from fully routed 1:100,000 hydrography. In a few cases
    streams had to be added to the hydrography dataset in order to provide a means to
    create shapefiles to represent abundance data associated with them. Streams added
    were digitized at no more than 1:24,000 scale based on stream line images portrayed
    in 1:24,000 Digital Raster Graphics (DRG).The features in this layer represent the
    location for which abundance data records apply. In many cases there are multiple
    datasets associated with the same location, and so, features may overlap. Please
    view the associated datasets for detail regarding specific features. In CalFish
    these are accessed through the "link" field that is visible when performing an
    identify or query operation. A URL string is provided with each feature in the downloadable
    data which can also be used to access the underlying datasets.The Chinook data that
    is available from the CalFish website is actually mirrored from the StreamNet website
    where the CalFish Abundance Database's tabular data is currently stored. Additional
    information about StreamNet may be downloaded at http://www.streamnet.org. Complete
