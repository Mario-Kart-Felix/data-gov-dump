  Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
  reef ecosystems, from 15 April - 7 May 2009, belt transect surveys of coral population
  and diseases quantitative assessments were conducted, as a part of Rapid Ecological
  Assessments (REA), during the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP)
  Cruise HI0903 in the Marianas Archipelago at biennial intervals by the Coral Reef
  Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC).
  During the cruise, there were 7 surveys in total conducted at REA sites around Farallon
  De Pajaros Island in the Marianas Archipelago. At the specific REA sites, coral
  biologists along with fish biologists, algal biologists and marine invertebrate
  zoologist entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~300 m2) and high degree
  of taxonomic resolution REA survey to assess and monitor species composition, abundance,
  percent cover, size distribution, diversity, and general health of fish, corals,
  macro-invertebrates, and algae in shallow-water (< 35 m) habitats. As a part of
  REA surveys, the coral belt surveys were focused on quantifying the diversity, abundance,
  density, and size-class distribution of the anthozoan and hydrozoan corals as well
  as the condition and health state of the coral reef populations. The surveys were
  conducted along two consecutively-placed, 25m transect lines. The belt width was
  dictated at the beginning of each dive by subjective perceived colony density: 1-m
  width was used in high density areas, while 2-m width was used in low density areas.
  Within each 25m transect, five 2.5-meter segments were surveyed (beginning at points:
  0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 meters), whereby in each segment, all coral colonies whose
  center fell within 0.5m of either side of the transect line were identified to the
  lowest taxonomic level possible (genus or species) and two planar size metrics were
  collected: maximum diameter and diameter perpendicular to the maximum diameter.
  In addition, the extent of mortality, both recent and old, was estimated for each
  colony. Observers paid special attention to identifying as best as possible the
  extent of the former live colony. When a coral colony exhibited signs of disease
  or compromised health, additional information was recorded including type of affliction
  (bleaching, skeletal growth anomaly, white syndrome, tissue loss other than white
  syndrome, trematodiasis, necrosis, other, pigmentation responses, algal overgrowth,
  and predation), severity of the affliction (mild, moderate, marked, severe, acute),
  as well as photographic documentation and sometimes tissue samples. Tissue samples
  were catalogued and fixed in buffered zinc-formalin solution for further histopathological
  analyses. Raw survey data included species presence and relative abundance, colony
  counts per taxon, size (width and length), mortality, predation, and health status.
  A surveyed area was ranging from 10m2 to 25m2 per site.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819\",\n\t\"extras\":
