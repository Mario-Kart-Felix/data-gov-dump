    ultra-high reliability electronic systems such as airborne and space electronic
    systems are driving the need for advanced heath monitoring techniques for early
    detection of the onset of damage. Aerospace-electronic systems usually face a very
    harsh environment, requiring them to survive the high strain rates, e.g. during
    launch and re-entry and thermal environments including extreme low and high temperatures.
    Traditional health monitoring methodologies have relied on reactive methods of failure
    detection often providing little or no insight into the remaining useful life of
    the system. In this paper, a mathematical approach for interrogation of system state
    under cyclic thermo- mechanical stresses has been developed for 6-different leadfree
    solder alloy systems. Data has been collected for leading indicators of failure
    for alloy systems including, Sn3Ag0.5Cu, Sn3Ag0.7Cu, Sn1Ag0.5Cu, Sn0.3Ag0.5Cu0.1Bi,
    Sn0.2Ag0.5Cu0.1Bi0.1Ni, 96.5Sn3.5Ag second-level interconnects under the application
    of cyclic thermo-mechanical loads. Methodology presented resides in the pre-failure
    space of the system in which no macro-indicators such as cracks or delamination
    exist. Systems subjected to thermo-mechanical damage have been interrogated for
    system state and the computed damage state correlated with known imposed damage.
    The approach involves the use of condition monitoring devices which can be interrogated
    for damage proxies at finite time- intervals. Interrogation techniques are based
    on derivation of damage proxies, and system prior damage based non-linear least-
    squares methods including the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm. The systemu2019s residual
    life is computed based on residual-life computation algorithms.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
