    various City of San Diego Park and Recreation Open Space lands in support of natural
    resource management objectives and the City's MSCP. In 2004, vegetation mapping
    and sensitive species surveys were conducted at the Tecolote Canyon Natural Park
    by HELIX Environmental Planning, Inc. (HELIX) to establish baseline data for the
    park's Natural Resource Management Plan. RECON Environmental conducted vegetation
    mapping at Mission Trails Regional Park (MTRP) in 2008 in support of the MSCP. This
    dataset was compiled as part of the Southern California Data Integration Project.
    Vegetation mapping (including mapping of exotic species) of Tecolote Canyon was
    conducted in the spring of 2004 on georeferenced aerial photos (flown January 2003;
    scale 1"=200'; Andrea Bitterling, pers. comm.). Vernal pools and rare plants were
    mapped with a GPS, with accuracy of approximately 1 meter. RECON biologists mapped
    the vegetation in MTRP between March 18 and April 24, 2008. A three-fold approach
    to vegetation mapping at MTRP was taken: reviewing historical biological information,
    mapping potential vegetation communities using aerial photographs, and conducting
    field mapping. Prior to conducting the field work, existing GIS data from the California
    Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB), vegetation data from SanGIS, and vernal pool
    data from the City of San Diego were all examined. In addition, aerial photographs
    from 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2007 were reviewed to assist with vegetation identification.
    Digital orthorectified aerial images with 1-foot resolution, taken in 2007, were
    carefully reviewed on a computer monitor and on printed maps prior to field surveys
    to identify unique color and shape patterns of exotic species and to distinguish
    stands (polygons) to be mapped in the field. These photographs, with preliminary
    stand overlays, were used to create field maps for MTRP. The field maps were used
    to confirm and map vegetation communities identified in the field. Field mapping
    consisted of driving or hiking to all areas in the MTRP. Areas identified as a homogeneous
    vegetation community stand in the field were mapped as individual polygons (CNPS
    2004). Homogenous stands ranged in size from 0.25 acre to hundreds of acres. Most
    of the homogeneous stands were large, making it difficult to summarize the species
    composition, cover, and structure of an entire stand. Sampling of representative
    portions of large stands was performed using the California Native Plant Society
    (CNPS) Rapid Assessment Method to determine the species composition and cover class
    for characteristic plant species within each stand. Sampling consisted of selecting
    a representative area, walking through the area, and identifying characteristic
    species present, qualitatively estimating cover for each characteristic species
    and using binoculars to scan the entire stand to confirm that it was homogenous.
    Occasionally, stands were inaccessible, precluding direct observations. In these
    cases, estimations were made using aerial photographs, binoculars, and best judgment
    of the biologists. Following field mapping, all collected data was reviewed in the
    office to determine a vegetation series classification, vegetation alliance and
    where applicable, an association (Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf classification). The series,
    alliance, and association were used to name all vegetation communities mapped at
    MTRP. Several factors limited data collection at MTRP. Primarily these included
    species phenology and some areas with difficult access. Native or invasive plant
    species apparent at the time of the surveys were noted and classified. Due to differences
    in phenology of many species, plants apparent or obvious outside of the early spring
    survey period may not have been identified. References Andrea Bitterling, HELIX.
