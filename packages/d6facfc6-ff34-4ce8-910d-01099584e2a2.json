The areas surrounding these stations accommodate a significant amount of future population, housing, and employment investment. The overall transportation network in Option B represents a balanced investment in roadways and transit. The Louisiana Speaks Regional Plan process study area includes the 35 southernmost parishes of Louisiana.",
