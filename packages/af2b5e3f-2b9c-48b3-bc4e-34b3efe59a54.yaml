    in text format (.txt) for a temperate dry steppe at Rio Mayo, Argentia. One file
    contains quarterly above-ground biomass data for grasses on the steepe (May 1984-May
    1985). The second file contains average annual above-ground primary production (ANPP)
    data for grasses and shrubs for years 1972-1997 based upon peak above-ground biomass
    estimates. The third file contains precipitation and maximum/minimum temperature
    data for the Rio Mayo site for the period 1968 through 1990.Rio Mayo is located
    in the Patagonia region of Argentina. The vegetation is chiefly composed of grasses
    and shrubs. Harvest methods were used to estimate grass and shrub production. Between
    1972 and 1997, peak annual ANPP of grasses plus shrubs ranged from 21 to 75 g/m2/yr,
    with an average of about 60 g/m2/yr. Grasses accounted for about two-thirds of the
    productivity. ANPP was reduced in a drought year, but did not increase in relatively
    wet years, suggesting that it may not be linearly related to precipitation. ANPP
    for 1984-1985 was slightly higher (79 g/m2/yr) when a different algorithm was used
    for estimation. Revision Notes: The original npp data file (rmy_npp.txt) has been
    split into two files, one file containing seasonal biomass and the other containing
    annual ANPP estimates. The data file containing annual ANPP estimates has been revised
    to extend temporage coverage and add additional annual ANPP data. See the Revisions
    section in this document for details.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
