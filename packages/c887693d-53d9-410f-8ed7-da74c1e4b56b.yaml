    backscatter mosaic of of a sharply sloping swath of the St. John Shelf, south of
    NE Reserve, offshore of Fajardo, Puerto Rico. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography
    Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and
    private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the in the Northeast
    Reserve from 4/04/2012 to 4/20/2012. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg
    1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS
    HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has
    been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA
    COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The backscatter component of the
    bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using Fledermaus
    Geocoder Toolbox 7.3 software. Acoustic backscatter mosaics are ostensibly an important
    piece of information when characterizing surficial seafloor features and delineating
    benthic habitats.The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards,
    dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate
    the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.",nt"owner_org":
