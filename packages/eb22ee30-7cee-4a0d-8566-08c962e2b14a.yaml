  and owls (raptors) were detected during playback surveys conducted between 28 March
  2005 and 21 July 2005 along 36 randomly selected watercourses in the foothills of
  the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. These data represent 260 positive responses for
  several species of hawks and owls to the playback surveys. This study was done by
  the North Central Region of the California Department of Fish and Game with support
  from the Resource Assessment Program. These data represent the point locations where
  individual hawks and owls were detected based on geographic algorithms using estimated
  distances and compass bearings from fixed points along public roads. Methodology:
  Playback surveys using MP3 players and battery-powered speakers were done to elicit
  vocal or behavioral responses from hawks and owls from fixed points along public
  roads in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The surveys were done along 36 randomly
  selected watercourses, and one or three surveys were done at the points between
  March and July 2005. Seventeen watercourses had one survey while 19 watercourses
  had three surveys. Survey periods were (1) March to mid-April, (2) late April to
  late May, and (3) June to July. Watercourses with one survey were surveyed during
  the March to mid-April period; watercourses with one survey were dropped from the
  study after the first survey due to logistic and manpower constraints. Each watercourse
  had 3-5 fixed points that were between 500-1,000 meters apart to ensure spatial
  independence. Hawk surveys were conducted between 8:00 am and 5:00 pm, while owl
  surveys were conducted between 8:30 pm and 4:15 am. Playback surveys were done with
  fixed sequences of species calls as follows: (1) for hawks, sharp-shinned hawks,
  Cooper's hawks, and red-shouldered hawks; and (2) for owls, flammulated owl (starting
  in May), northern saw-whet owl, northern pygmy-owl, western screech-owl, long-eared
  owl, and great-horned owl. No calls were done for red-tailed hawks, osprey, Swainson's
  hawks, or barn owls which were detected during the surveys and included in these
  data. The duration of the playbacks for each species consisted of a 1-minute silent
  period, a 4-minute playback period with 4 repeated sequences of 30 seconds of vocalizations
  followed by 30 seconds of silence, and a 1-minute silent period. The speaker initially
  faced North, and was then rotated South, West, and East with successive 30-second
  playback/30-second silence periods. Detected animals were visually or aurally located
  and identified. Laser rangefinders were used to estimate distances, while compasses
  were used to derive compass bearings. Habitats of detected animals were determined
  from field observations during the day for hawks or from aerial photographs with
  owls based on knowledge of field conditions at the fixed points. A GIS algorithm
  was used to locate the estimated field locations based on the estimated distances
  and compass bearings, and then habitats were verified with aerial photographs. The
  sex and age of each detected individual was determined if possible, and observers
  rated the confidence of their determination of the number of individuals, species
  type, sex and age of each detection.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\":
