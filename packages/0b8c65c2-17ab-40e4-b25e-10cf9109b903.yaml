  count survey project was conducted in Pool 21 of the Upper Mississippi River, Adams
  County, Illinois. The study area was the Long Island Complex (river miles 332.5
  to 340.5). This study area included approximately 4,084 acres which was primarily
  comprised of mature floodplain bottomland forest, except for approximately 681 acres
  which were active agricultural fields until the early to mid-1990u2019s, after which
  agriculture was abandoned. Since then, this acreage has been undergoing ecological
  succession and is now comprised of old field and early successional floodplain forest.
  Additionally, this study area included several associated sloughs, wetlands, and
  backwaters. During this project, we established 48 point count locations along six
  transects. One transect (12 survey points) was located in the old field/early successional
  forest habitat. The remaining five transects (36 survey points) were established
  within the mature floodplain forest habitat. Each point was sampled two times during
  the breeding season (early June through early July). Ten-minute unlimited radius
  point counts were conducted, resulting in 96 sampled points. Additionally, u201cspecies
  of interestu201d identified between points (i.e. interpoint data) were also recorded.
  A cumulative total of 87 species were identified during this project. Of these,
  82 species were recorded at one or more points, while 56 species were encountered
  at interpoints. The 87 species consisted of 17 Permanent Residents, 31 North American
  Migrants, and 39 Neotropical Migrants. Overall, 5,169 individual birds were identified
  at points, with an additional 477 tallied at interpoints. Among data from the point
  locations, the 10 most abundant species included: Common Grackle, Northern Cardinal,
  Indigo Bunting, Great Crested Flycatcher, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Eastern Wood-Pewee,
  American Robin, Black-capped Chickadee, American Crow, and Red-winged Blackbird.
  These species also had the highest relative densities. The 10 most frequently encountered
  species were similar, except the Brownheaded Cowbird and Red-eyed Vireo replaced
  the American Robin and Red-winged Blackbird, respectively. The 11 most widely distributed
  species included: Indigo Bunting, Northern Cardinal, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Great
  Crested Flycatcher, Common Grackle, Black-capped Chickadee, Red-headed Woodpecker,
  American Crow, Chimney Swift, Eastern Wood-Pewee, and Brown-headed Cowbird. This
  project provides preliminary baseline data regarding breeding season avian use of
  the mature and early successional forest habitats which are found within the Long
  Island Complex study area.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"4d7ad1cd-3641-420b-8116-e4082f49cd44\",\n\t\"extras\":
