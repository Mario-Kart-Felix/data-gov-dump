Our main objectives were to: 1)\nProduce a catalogue of favorable structural environments and models for geothermal systems. 2)\nImprove site\u2010specific targeting of geothermal resources through detailed studies of representative sites,\nwhich included innovative techniques of slip tendency analysis of faults and 3D modeling. 3) Compare\nand contrast the structural controls and models in different tectonic settings. 4) Synthesize data and\ndevelop methodologies for enhancement of exploration strategies for conventional and EGS systems,\nreduction in the risk of drilling non\u2010productive wells, and selecting the best EGS sites.\nPhase I (Year 1) involved a broad inventory of structural settings of geothermal systems in the Great\nBasin, Walker Lane, and southern Cascades, with the aim of developing conceptual structural models\nand a structural catalogue of the most favorable structural environments. This overview permitted\nselection of 5\u20106 representative sites for more detailed studies in Years 2 and 3. Sites were selected on\nthe basis of quality of exposure, potential for development, availability of subsurface data, and type of\nsystem, so that major types of systems can be evaluated and compared. The detailed investigations\nincluded geologic mapping, kinematic analysis, stress determinations, gravity surveys, integration of\navailable geophysical data, slip tendency analysis, and for some areas 3D modeling.
