    Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, from 15 January - 6 February 2006, line point intercept (LPI) surveys
    of benthic parameter assessments were conducted, as a part of Rapid Ecological Assessments
    (REA), during the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruise HI0601
    in the Pacific Remote Island Areas at biennial intervals by the Coral Reef Ecosystem
    Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). During
    the cruise, 6 REA sites were surveyed at Howland Island in the Pacific Remote Island
    Areas. At the specific REA sites, coral biologists along with algal biologists,
    marine invertebrate zoologist, and fish biologists entered the water and conducted
    a fine-scale (~300 m2) and high degree of taxonomic resolution REA survey to assess
    and monitor species composition, abundance, percent cover, size distribution, diversity,
    and general health of fish, corals, macro-invertebrates, and algae in shallow-water
    (< 35 m) habitats. As a part of REA surveys, the line point intercept surveys were
    used to quantitatively assess average percent live coral cover and other benthic
    substrates at REA sites. The surveys were conducted along two consecutively-placed
    25m transect lines by a coral biologist. All benthic elements falling directly underneath
    the transect line at 20-cm to 50-cm intervals were recorded as one of nine benthic
    categories: live coral, dead coral, carbonate pavement, encrusting coralline algae,
    macroalgae, coral rubble, sand, rock, and other benthic sessile invertebrates. All
    living benthic elements (e.g., coral, algae, and other invertebrates) were identified
    to the lowest taxonomic level possible. These data provide the basis for computing
    quantitative estimates of percent live coral cover, as well as percent cover of
    the different benthic constituents.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
