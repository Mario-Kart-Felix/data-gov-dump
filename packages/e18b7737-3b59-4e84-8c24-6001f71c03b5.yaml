  Refuge were visited in May of 2012 to verify locations of springs from previous
  mapping efforts and to estimate the total contributions within the refuge boundaries.
  This field visit was conducted to get a snapshot of spring discharge in advance
  of an upcoming adjudication and the Comprehensive Conservation Plan. An updated
  GIS file geodatabase feature class was developed to show locations of springs. Updates
  to an older file geodatabase feature class developed from 1988 and 1994 claim maps
  were made using aerial imagery and field verification. No changes to spring locations
  were made for the middle or northern portion of the refuge. The total estimated
  inflow to the refuge during the May 2012 visit was estimated to be between 23,944
  and 23,996 acre feet per annum (afa). Springs in the southern region (from Spring
  Number 151 and south to Fort Ruby) not including Flynn Spring was estimated to contribute
  7.93 to 8.00 cubic feet per second (cfs, 5,744 to 5,796 afa). Flow from Flynn Spring
  at the source was estimated as 1.64 cfs (1,188 afa) but confidence in this estimate
  is poor. Springs in the northern region (all springs north of and including Spring
  Number 240 up to Spring Number 105) was estimated to contribute 15,894 afa. Springs
  in the remaining regions around the refuge were not measured directly, but were
  estimated to contribute 1,118 afa.Measurement differences between 1984 and 2012,
  in which 2012 discharges ranged from 30.2 to 42 percent lower than estimates made
  in 1984, were likely a result of differences in climate, measurement technique,
  and variability of springs in terms of magnitude of flow and response to climate.
  Although Cave Creek is considered the largest single contributing spring to the
  system, during this measurement year Cave Creek only accounted for 20 to 22 percent
  of the remaining measured spring contributions which indicated that the remaining
  springs were also a significant water supply for the refuge. Continuation of monitoring
  of selected spring inflow and at similar locations to the sites selected for measurement
  during this synoptic during other years with different climate conditions would
  help to better understand the response of spring flow to climate. When compared
  over the long term, this information can also be used to detect changes in response
  to pumping from neighboring lands and in response to climate change.\",\n\t\"owner_org\":
