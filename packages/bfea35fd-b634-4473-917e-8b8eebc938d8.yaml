  Mapping Initiative was a two-phase mapping endeavor that occurred over a three-year
  period (2007-2009). Note that while the processing occurred during the 2207-2009
  period, all satellite data used in the project was acquired in 2005. Concurrent
  with mapping the state of Kansas, the Kansas River Watershed was also mapped. The
  Kansas River Watershed extends into southern Nebraska and includes a portion of
  eastern Colorado. During Phase I a Modified Level I map was produced. In Phase II
  a series of maps, Modified Level II through IV, were produced. All KLCP 2005 map
  products were produced at four spatial extents: the state of Kansas plus a 300 meter
  buffer, a DEM-derived watershed boundary of the Kansas River, the Kansas River watershed
  boundary plus a 1,000 meter buffer, and a combined dataset of the state of Kansas
  plus 300 meter buffer and the watershed plus 1,000 meter buffer.These extents are
  annotated in the file names with the extentions k, w, wb, and kwb respectively.
  The goal of Phase II was to map subclasses for grassland and cropland, classes which
  were mapped during Phase I. For the Level II map, cool- and warm-season grasslands
  were mapped along with Spring Crop, Summer Crop, Alfalfa, Fallow, and Double-Crop
  classes. For the Level III map, the Summer Crop subclasses Corn, Soybean, and Sorghum
  were mapped, and the Spring Crop class was reassigned to Winter Wheat. In the Level
  IV map, irrigation status was mapped and added to the Level III crop type map.The
  Kansas Land Cover Patterns Level IV map contains twenty-four land use/land cover
  classes and has a positional accuracy and spatial resolution appropriate for producing
  1:50,000 scale maps. The minimum map unit (MMU) varies by land cover class and ranges
  from 0.22 to 5.12 acres. In general, the mapping methodology used a hybrid, hierarchical
  classification of multi-temporal, multi-resolution imagery to develop modified Anderson
  Level II through Anderson Level IV land cover maps of the Kansas River Watershed
  and the State of Kansas. More specifically, multi-seasonal Landsat Thematic Mapper
  (TM) imagery from the 2004 and 2005 growing season was used to map the grassland
  subclasses (cool- and warm-season grasslands). while MODIS NDVI time-series imagery
  from the 2005 growing season was used to map cropland subclasses. The land use/land
  cover classes in the Level IV map are coded hierarchically to allow aggregation
  of land use and land cover classes as needed by the end-user. For example, a user
  can aggregate the Level IV map classes to a Level III classification by ignoring
  or eliminating the last digit of each land use/land cover class. Likewise, a Level
  II and Level I map can be created from the Level IV map by eliminating the last
  two and three digits, respectively, from each Level IV land use/land cover class.
  A formal accuracy assessment found the Level II, Level III, and Level IV maps to
  have overall accuracy levels of 86.3%, 82.0%, and 74.3%, respectively. User and
  Producer (per-class errors of commission and omission) accuracies vary by land cover
  class and users are encouraged to reference the reported accuracy levels in the
  final report and/or metadata when using the Kansas Land Cover Patterns map series.
  Digital versions of the map, metadata, and accuracy assessment can be accessed from
  the Data Access Support Center (http://www.kansasgis.org/) or the Kansas Applied
  Remote Sensing Program (http://www.kars.ku.edu/).\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\":
