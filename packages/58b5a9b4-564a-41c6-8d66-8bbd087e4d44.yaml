    research and technology development that: 1) enables the development or modification
    of Agency-level human health and performance standards by the Office of the Chief
    Health and Medical Officer (OCHMO) and 2) provides Human Exploration Operations
    Mission Directorate (HEOMD) with methods of meeting those standards in the design,
    development, and operation of mission systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HRP research focuses
    on reducing crew health and performance risks for exploration missions.&amp;nbsp;
    In addition, HRP research gathers the data necessary to understand and mitigate
    the long-term health risks to the crew, to allow the update of specific crew health
    standards for each mission scenario, to support crew selection, and to address any
    rehabilitation requirements.&amp;nbsp; The OCHMO owns and sets the standards upon
    which the HRP research efforts are based.&amp;nbsp; The Transition to Medical Practice
    process defined by the OCHMO is used to review the HRP deliverable countermeasures
    and technologies prior to their operational use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HRP technology
    development advances medical care and countermeasure systems for exploration and
    vehicle development programs&amp;rsquo; missions.&amp;nbsp; The HRP also develops
    and matures operational concepts to inform requirements for the design and operation
    of space vehicles and habitats needed for exploration.&amp;nbsp; This includes requirements
    for displays and controls, internal environments, operations planning, habitability,
    and methodologies for maintaining crew physical and mental health as well as physical
    and cognitive capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HRP is managed at the Johnson
    Space Center (JSC) and comprised of six research and technology development projects.&amp;nbsp;
    These projects provide the program knowledge and capabilities to conduct research
    addressing the human health and performance risks as well as advancing the readiness
    levels of technology and countermeasures to the point of transfer to the customer
    programs and organizations.&amp;nbsp; The six projects within the HRP are referred
    to as Program Elements throughout this document.&amp;nbsp; Each Element is managed
    at the JSC with research and technology development expertise provided by JSC, Ames
    Research Center (ARC), Glenn Research Center (GRC), the Langley Research Center
    (LaRC), and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), as well as other Agencies, institutions
    and organizations identified in the following Element descriptions.&amp;nbsp; The
    six Elements are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;u&gt;Space Radiation
    (SR) Element&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; The SR Element performs investigations to develop
    the scientific basis to accurately predict and mitigate health risks from the space
    radiation environment.&amp;nbsp; This knowledge yields recommendations to permissible
    exposure limits, assessment/projection tools/models of crew risk from radiation
    exposure, and models/tools to assess vehicle design for radiation protection.&amp;nbsp;
    The SR Element conducts research using accelerator-based simulation of space radiation.&amp;nbsp;
    The SR Element explores and develops countermeasures to the deleterious effects
    of radiation on human health.&amp;nbsp; The LaRC and ARC contribute to the SR Element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;u&gt;Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP) Element&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; The
    BHP Element identifies and characterizes the behavioral and performance risks associated
    with training, living and working in space, and returning to Earth.&amp;nbsp; The
    BHP Element develops strategies, tools, and technologies to mitigate these risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;u&gt;Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Element&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; The
    ExMC Element is responsible for defining requirements for crew health maintenance
    during exploration missions, developing treatment scenarios, extrapolating from
    the scenarios to health management modalities, and evaluating the feasibility of
    those modalities for use during exploration missions.&amp;nbsp; The ExMC Element
    is also responsible for the technology and informatics development that will enable
    the availability of medical care and decision systems for exploration missions.&amp;nbsp;
    GRC, LaRC and ARC contribute technology development and clinical care expertise
    to the ExMC Element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;u&gt;Space Human
    Factors and Habitability (SHFH) Element&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; The SHFH Element is
    focused on the human system in space environments: &amp;nbsp;how do humans interface
    with spacecraft systems, and what environmental and habitation factors are essential
    to maintain crew health and performance?&amp;nbsp; The SHFH Element has three main
    focus areas:&amp;nbsp; space human factors engineering, advanced environmental health,
    and advanced food technology.&amp;nbsp; The ARC contributes to the SHFH Element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;u&gt;Human Health Countermeasures (HHC) Element&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; The HHC
    Element is responsible for understanding the physiological effects of spaceflight
    and developing countermeasure strategies and procedures.&amp;nbsp; The Element provides
    the biomedical expertise for the development and assessment of medical standards
    and vehicle and spacesuit requirements dictated by human physiological needs.&amp;nbsp;
    In addition, the HHC Element develops a validated and integrated suite of countermeasures
    for exploration missions to ensure the maintenance of crew health during all mission
    phases.&amp;nbsp; The ARC and GRC contribute to the HHC Element as well as international
    agencies cooperating on joint flight proposals, reduced gravity studies, and collaborative
    bed rest studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;u&gt;International
    Space Station Medical Projects (ISSMP) Element&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; The ISSMP Element
    is responsible for managing all ISS and ground analog human research activities,
    including those integrated with operational medical support of the crews, and to
    ensure research tasks are completed.&amp;nbsp; The ISSMP is responsible for all
    planning, integration, and implementation services for HRP research tasks and evaluation
    activities requiring access to space or related flight resources on the ISS, Soyuz,
    Progress, Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV), commercial vehicles and ground-based
    spaceflight analogs.&amp;nbsp; This includes support to related pre- and postflight
    activities.&amp;nbsp; The ARC contributes to the ISSMP with technical support to
    experiment management, hardware development, and international partner integration.&amp;nbsp;
    KSC provides support for baseline data collection requirements development for future
    crew vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work performed within the six Elements is supported
    by numerous collaborative efforts with academia and international agencies.&amp;nbsp;
    Relationships with the ISS Program, the National Space Biomedical Research Institute
    (NSBRI), the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), and the University of Texas Medical
    Branch (UTMB) are critical to the HRP successfully meeting its objectives.&amp;nbsp;
    The HRP also maintains collaborative relationships with the International Partners
    through various working groups.&amp;nbsp; These relationships enhance the research
    capabilities and provide synergy between the research and technology efforts of
    different countries.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
