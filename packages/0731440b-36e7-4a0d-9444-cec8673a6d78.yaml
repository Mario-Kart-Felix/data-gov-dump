    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    analysis of soil samples for Nitrate (NO3) and physical properties that were collected
    for one year following reduced impact logging in logging concessions at the Fazenda
    Rohsamar in the municipality of Juruena in northwestern Mato Grosso. Sample locations
    were randomly selected from stratified regions of the 1,400 ha Block 5 to account
    for local scale soil variability. Soil samples were collected to 8-m depth in (1)
    nine gaps formed by single tree removal and (2) nine areas of undisturbed primary
    forest. Areas of undisturbed forest were confined to patches of forest within Block
    5 that were protected from logging.  An additional 3 forested areas were sampled
    to 3-m depth that contained high sand content. These results quantified the effects
    of reduced impact logging, to test whether nitrogen (N) loss from leaves and coarse
    woody debris under reduced impact logging results in a significant accumulation
    of subsoil nitrate (Feldpausch et al., 2009). One comma separated data file contains
    the soil moisture results and a second file the soil NO3 content and soil physical
    properties.",nt"owner_org": "d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed",nt"extras":
