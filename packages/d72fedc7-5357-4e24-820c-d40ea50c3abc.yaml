    of Transportation and the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration,
    the USGS developed a database of geomorphic data for a sampling of unregulated natural
    alluvial streams in Ohio. The vector point shapefile that these metadata describe
    is based on this geomorphic database and consists of 50 points and associated attributes.
    The database was developed as part of a study to develop methods to estimate bankfull
    characteristics of Ohio streams and to relate geomorphic characteristics of Ohio
    streams to peak streamflows of selected recurrence intervals. The results of the
    study are presented in a report by Sherwood and Huitger (2005). The database developed
    for this study consists of geomorphic, basin, and flood-frequency characteristics
    for 50 study sites in Ohio, of which 40 sites are near streamflow-gaging stations.
    Field surveys were done at each site to collect the geomorphic data. Bankfull indicators
    were identified and evaluated, cross-section and longitudinal profiles were surveyed,
    and bed- and bank-material were sampled. Field data were analyzed to determine various
    geomorphic characteristics such as bankfull width, bankfull mean depth, bankfull
    cross-sectional area, bankfull discharge, streambed slope, and bed- and bank-material
    particle-size distribution. The various geomorphic characteristics were analyzed
    by means of a combination of graphical and statistical techniques. These techniques
    resulted in a set of regional curves, simple-regression (drainage-area only) equations,
    and multiple-regression equations to estimate bankfull width, bankfull mean depth,
    bankfull cross-sectional area, and bankfull discharge. Explanatory variables included
    drainage area, main-channel slope, main-channel elevation index, median bed-material
    particle size, bankfull cross-sectional area, and local-channel slope. Average standard
    errors of prediction for bankfull width equations ranged from 20.6 to 24.8 percent;
    for bankfull mean depth, 18.8 to 20.6 percent; for bankfull cross-sectional area,
    25.4 to 30.6 percent; and for bankfull discharge, 27.0 to 78.7 percent. The simple-regression
    (drainage-area only) equations have the highest average standard errors of prediction.
    The multiple-regression equations-in which the explanatory variables included drainage
    area, main-channel slope, main-channel elevation index, median bed-material particle
    size, bankfull cross-sectional area, and local-channel slope-have the lowest average
    standard errors of prediction. Statistical and graphical analyses were done to investigate
    development of methods to estimate flood-peak discharges from geomorphic characteristics
    based on the 40 study sites at streamflow-gaging stations. The logarithms of the
    annual peak discharges for each site were fit by a Pearson Type III frequency distribution
    to develop a flood-peak-frequency relation for each site. The peak-frequency data
    were related to geomorphic, basin, and climatic variables of the 40 study sites
    by multiple-regression analysis. The analyses resulted in a set of multiple-regression
    equations to estimate flood-peak discharge having recurrence intervals of 2, 5,
    10, 25, 50, and 100 years from bankfull cross-sectional area, in which the average
    standard errors of prediction are 31.6, 32.6, 35.9, 41.5, 46.2, and 51.2 percent,
    respectively. Sherwood, J.M. and Huitger, C.A., 2005, Bankfull Characteristics of
