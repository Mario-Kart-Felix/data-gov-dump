    an inflatable structure and form fiber-reinforced composites on-orbit is a novel
    concept that builds on current NASA technology in expandable structures.&amp;nbsp;
    The current effort to design and build a prototype has sucessfully demonstrated
    a proof of concept that the technology is viable using current state-of-the art
    materials and manufacturing techniques.&amp;nbsp; A cylinder shaped object with
    round end caps was manufactured as a simple article, but domed shapes are possible
    and expected to be the most efficient although more complex to design and build.&amp;nbsp;
    A braided carbon fiber fabric material of two ply thickness was utilized in the
    prototype to provide a thin and optimally reinforced structure.&amp;nbsp; The fabric
    was contained on two sides with laminated sheet polymer to form a vacuum bag attached
    at both end caps. Vacuum ports and resin fill ports were located at opposite ends
    and routed to the fabric cavity between the two polymer sheets.&amp;nbsp; The cavity
    was evacuated and filled with resin that cured to form a rigid composite structure
    cylinder.&amp;nbsp; It is planned to perform a pressure test of the cylinder and
    produce a preliminary design of a larger dome-ended structure for proposed future
    work. A conceptual design for the mechanical system required to provide the internal
    pressure, vacuum resin trap, and resin mixing and filling will also be presented.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
