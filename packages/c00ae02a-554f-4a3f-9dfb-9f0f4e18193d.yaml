    bathymetry and shaded-relief maps of the Offshore of Point Reyes map area, California.
    Raster data file is included in "Bathymetry_PointReyes.zip," which is accessible
    from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/PointReyes/data_catalog_PointReyes.html. The bathymetry
    and shaded-relief maps of the Offshore of Point Reyes Map Area, California, were
    generated from bathymetry data collected by California State University, Monterey
    Bay (CSUMB), and by Fugro Pelagos. Mapping was completed between 2007 and 2010,
    using a combination of 200-kHz and 400-kHz Reson 7125, and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam
    echosounders, as well as 468-kHz SEA SWATHPlus interferometric system. These mapping
    missions combined to collect bathymetry from about the 10-m isobath to beyond the
    3-nautical-mile limit of California's State Waters. NOTE: the horizontal datum of
    the bathymetry data (NAD83) differs from the horizontal datum of other layers in
    this DS (WGS84). These data are not intended for navigational purposes.",nt"license_title":
