    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "<p>The National Survey of Substance Abuse
    Treatment Services (N-SSATS) (formerly titled Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS))
    is designed to collect information from all facilities in the United States, both
    public and private, that provides substance abuse treatment. N-SSATS is one of three
    components of SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly
    Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)) and is designed to provide
    the mechanism for quantifying the dynamic character and composition ofthe United
    States substance abuse treatment delivery system. In 1995, SAMHSA created BHSIS
    (formerly DASIS) to facilitate the integration of its existing treatment service's
    datasets and to reduce redundancy in data collection and reporting. The other two
    BHSIS components are the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS)
    and the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). The I-SATS is a comprehensive listing
    of all known substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States. The TEDS
    is a client-level database of individuals admitted to publicly funded substance
    abuse treatment facilities and is available from the SAMHDA Web site. Together,
    these three BHSIS components provide national- and state-level data on persons receiving
    alcohol and substance abuse treatment as well as data on the facilities providing
    the treatment.</p>n<p>Data collected in N-SSATS include topics covering ownership,
    services offered (assessment and pre-treatment, testing, transitional, ancillary,
    pharmacotherapies), primary focus (substance abuse, mental health, both, general
    health, other), hotline operation, methadone/Levo-Alpha Acetyl Methadol (LAAM)/buprenorphine
    dispensing, counseling and therapeutic approaches, special programs or groups, languages
    in which treatment is provided, type of treatment provided, number of clients (total
    and under age 18), number of beds, types of payment accepted, sliding fee scale,
    and facility accreditation and licensure/certification.</p>n<p>The data elements
    and format that make up the core of the N-SSATS were first used in 1976 as part
    of survey efforts designed to measure the scope and use of drug abuse treatment
    services in the United States. This core was used throughout the 1970s and 1980s
    in several different surveys. In 1987 the first administration of the National Drug
    and Alcoholism Treatment Unit Survey (NDATUS) took place, and then occurred annually
    from 1989 to 1993. After the creation of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
    Administration (SAMHSA) in 1992, NDATUS was redesigned as the Uniform Facility Data
    Set (UFDS), which was conducted from 1995 to 1998. In 1999, an abbreviated survey
    was conducted and the survey was redesigned. The 1999 study is not publicly available.
    In 2000, the full survey was conducted and renamed the National Survey of Substance
    Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS).</p>n<p>N-SSATS is a point-prevalence survey.
    It provides information on the substance abuse treatment system and its clients
    on the reference date. Client counts reported here do not represent annual totals.
    Rather, N-SSATS provides a "snapshot" of substance abuse treatment facilities
    and clients on an average day. Through 2000, the N-SSATS reference date was October
    1. In 2001, SAMHSA changed the reference date to the last business day in March.
    This change helped increase the timeliness of responses by individual facilities,
    but resulted in no data being collected for 2001. Therefore, 2002 marked the first
    year data were collected using the new reference date.</p>n<p>The N-SSATS is sponsored
    by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality at the Substance Abuse
    and Mental Health Services Administration.</p>n",nt"license_title": "Other
