    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "This paper introduces a novel Prognostics-enhanced
    Automated Contingency Management (or ACM+P) paradigm based on both current health
    state (diagnosis) and future health state estimates (prognosis) for advanced autonomous
    systems. Including prognostics in ACM system allows not only fault accommodation,
    but also fault mitigation via proper control actions based on short term prognosis,
    and moreover, the establishment of a long term operational plan that optimizes thernutility
    of the entire system based on long term prognostics. Technical challenges are identified
    and addressed by a hierarchical ACM+P architecture that allows fault accommodation
    and mitigation at various levels in the system ranging from component level control
    reconfiguration, system level control reconfiguration, to high level mission re-planning
    and resource redistribution. The ACM+P paradigm was developed and evaluated in a
    high fidelity Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) simulation environment with flight-proven
    baseline flight controller and simulated diagnostics and prognostics of flight control
    actuators. Simulation results are presented. The ACM+P concept, architecture and
    the generic methodologies presented in this paper are applicable to many advanced
    autonomous systems such as deep space probes, unmanned autonomous vehicles, and
    military and commercial aircraft.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
