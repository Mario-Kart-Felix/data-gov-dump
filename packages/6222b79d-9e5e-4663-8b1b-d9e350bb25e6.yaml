    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Research suggests that: (1) orbital debris
    has reached the point that, even with no future launches, collisions among large-body
    debris will lead to unstable growth in debris, and (2) removing as few as five large
    objects each year can stabilize debris growth. For large-body active debris removal
    (LB-ADR), new technologies are required to safely capture the target debris. The
    interactions of these complex electromechanical systems (eg. imaging systems, robotic
    arms and grippers) and controllers pose challenges best addressed by hardware-in-the-loop
    (HWIL) testing. Given the risks inherent in non-cooperative spacecraft proximity
    operations and the firm requirement that ADR missions do not themselves produce
    additional debris, realistic ground-based testing is required for risk reduction.rnrnOur
    approach to HWIL contains two major advancements: (1) novel robotic technologies
    that overcome the limitations of existing test facilities, and (2) carefully designed
    spacecraft models capable of thoroughly evaluating every aspect of a capture system.
    The LASR Lab was built around HOMER, an omnidirectional robot designed and built
    specifically to emulate the 6-DOF relative-motion trajectories of spacecraft. The
    Phase I effort validated HOMER's capabilities and reduced to hardware the Dynamic
    Payload Pendulum (DPP), an actively controlled pendulum that provides the equivalent
    of a 5-DOF air-bearing. Together, they permit large-scale motion with accurate contact
    dynamics. Having identified rocket boosters as ideal LB-ADR targets, we investigated
    the model features necessary for realistic testing of grappling and sensing systems
    and for accurate dynamic response on the DPP. Leveraging the developments of Phase
    I and concurrent work on autonomous, vision-based navigation systems at the LASR
    Lab, we propose to simultaneously advance the TRL of the ground-test facility and
    the nav systems by performing an end-to-end simulation of an approach and capture
    of multiple rocket bodies.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
