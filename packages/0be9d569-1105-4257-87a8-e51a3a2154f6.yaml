    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Summary: This dataset contains projections
    of coastal cliff-retreat rates and positions for future scenarios of sea-level rise
    (SLR). Projections were made using numerical and statistical models based on field
    observations such as historical cliff retreat rate, submarine slope, coastal cliff
    height, and mean annual wave power. Details: Cliff-retreat rate and position projections
    are for scenarios of 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 meters of sea-level rise (SLR) by the
    year 2100. Projections were made at CoSMoS cross-shore transects(CST) spaced 100
    m alongshore. Generally, projections were not made at transects where the sea cliff
    was armored or otherwise obstructed (for example, houses on the beach in front of
    the cliff, road between the beach and cliff), though some local exceptions apply
    where the obstruction was low enough to be easily overwashed. Spatial projections,
    such as those in the Google Earth KMZs, were made using a baseline sea-cliff edge
    from 2010. Two process-based, numerical cliff-profile evolution models were used
    to make projections: a soft-rock model by Walkden and Hall (2005, 2011) and a hard-rock
    model by Trenhaile (2000, 2009, 2011). Both models relate breaking-wave height and
    period to rock erosion, and distribute erosion vertically over a tidal cycle. Model
    behavior includes a variable beach slope that varies with the prevailing wave climate,
    wave run-up (Stockdon and other, 2006), and wave set-up that raises the water level
    during big-wave events and allows waves to impact the sea cliff with greater efficacy
    and frequency. The models were run on idealized cliff profiles extending from about
    10 m water depth to 1 kilometer inland from the cliff edge. Profiles were extracted
    by overlaying the cross-shore transects on a high-resolution digital elevation model
    (DEM) covering the Southern California study area. Using aerial photography, the
    presence of a beach was recorded (yes or no) for all transects, and the cliff toe
    elevation (or beach/cliff junction) was digitized from the DEM profiles. Using historic
    cliff edge retreat rates by Hapke and Reid (2007), unknown coefficients within the
    cliff-profile models were calibrated using a Monte Carlo simulation (in other words,
    coefficients were tuned until the modeled mean retreat rate equaled the observed
    mean retreat rate for a given transect). This was successful for nearly 1,000 DEM
    profiles (about 45percent of all cliff transects). For those nearly 1,000 profiles,
    the profile models were run for two time periods: first, a period of 100u2013200
    years using a historic rate of sea-level rise (2 mm/yr), and then for another 100
    years using an accelerated mean rate of sea-level rise (5, 10, 15, or 20 mm/yr).
    The projected cliff-retreat rates are thus mean annual rates that represent the
    total retreat that occurred during this second time period. Each of the resulting
    nearly 5,000 model runs had one dependent (predicted mean annual cliff retreat for
    a given sea-level rise scenario) and multiple semi-independent variables that determined
    the magnitude of the dependent variable (such as historic retreat rate, shore platform
    slope, cliff height, cliff-toe/beach height, cliff-face slope, mean annual wave
    power, beach slope). This information was used to train a statistical model called
    an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The ANN iteratively maps the independent variables
    to the dependent variable using linear algebra and a weighting system that gives
    importance to the variables that most strongly influence future sea-cliff retreat.
    In the end, the trained ANN is a standalone model that has learned, and can reproduce,
    the process-based cliff-profile model behavior. Independent tests between cliff
    profile model output and ANN output showed very good agreement (R-squared = 0.89
    - 0.96; root-mean-square-error less than 0.1 m/yr). The trained ANN was then applied
    to each cross-shore transect, where observed independent variables such as sea cliff
    height, historic cliff retreat, mean wave power, shore platform slope, sea-level
    rise scenario, and cliff toe height were passed through the ANN to yield a prediction
    of future long-term cliff retreat rate. Two separate ANNs were trained: one to make
    predictions of the difference between future and historic cliff retreat rates (in
    other words, prediction = future cliff-retreat rate*historic cliff-retreat rate)
    and another to predict the mean trend, or acceleration, of cliff retreat as a function
    of sea-level rise (in other words, future cliff retreat = m*SLR + historic retreat
    rate, where the ANN predicts m). Training two separate ANNs allowed for two different
    predictions for each transect from the same training data. Of the 2,117 cliff transects,
    there were 8 for which a prediction could not be made, likely because values of
    independent variables fell outside of the range used to train the ANNs. A prediction
    was made for these 8 transects by interpolating from multiple neighboring transects
    for which results were available. Uncertainty was tallied using a RMSE approach.
    The RMSE approach represents cumulative uncertainty from multiple sources and assumes
    that different sources of error will, at times, cancel each other out. It is therefore
    not a 'worst-case uncertainty' (in other words, a straight sum of errors) but instead
    an average uncertainty. Sources of cumulative uncertainty included in the RMSE calculation
    are the base error of the historic retreat rates that the predictions are relative
    to (0.2 m/yr; Hapke and Reid, 2007), the difference between ANN and cliff-profile
    model predictions (about 0.1 m/yr), and the spread between the predictions using
    the two different ANN models (about 0.1 m/yr). Total RMSE increased with SLR rate
    and varied between 0.20 and 0.32 m/yr. Final cliff-retreat rates for a given SLR
    scenario are an average of the two different ANN predictions. The predictions were
    nominally smoothed using a Butterworth Filter to increase alongshore continuity
    and emphasize spatial trends in cliff retreat. References Cited: Hapke, C.J., and
