	"notes": "Two main innovations will be developed in the Phase II effort that are fundamentally associated with our gaseous oxygen\/gaseous methane RCS thruster.  The first innovation is that of an integrated torch igniter\/injector which, provides simple and reliable ignition for the thruster.  The second innovation is the thruster's capability to operate with both gaseous and liquid propellants.  This innovation enables greater system flexibility that is inherent in the capacity to function over a much wider range of operating conditions. \r\n\r\nOrion has been approached by several prospective customers concerning affordable, reusable thrusters. In the current commercial market, this does not exist and the commercial sector cannot afford traditional propulsion solutions. For this reason, Orion started developing a thruster that offers the following features:\r\n\r\n?\tProvides an affordable solution as compared to what is currently available\r\n?\tUses a different manned approach since it is reusable\r\n?\tUses a modular design, which allows for the robust inspection and replacement of parts\r\n?\tUses green propellants and capitalizes on in situ propellant production\r\n?\tProvides greater system flexibility since it operates with both liquid and gaseous propellants\r\n\r\nNot only does the gas\/gas operation of the thruster attract companies such as t\/Space and Bigleow Aerospace, but its liquid\/liquid operation broadens this customer base and makes this design applicable to NASA programs such as the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).\r\n",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
