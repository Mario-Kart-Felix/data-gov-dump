    1 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of the north shore of St. Croix (Buck
    Island), US Virgin Islands. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration
    with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners,
    acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05.
    Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz)
    and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all
    correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower
    low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is
    in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate
    a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the
    BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion
    tool 'Feature to Raster' was used to generate the final ESRI Grid. The project was
    conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project
    area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data
    according to their own needs and standards.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
