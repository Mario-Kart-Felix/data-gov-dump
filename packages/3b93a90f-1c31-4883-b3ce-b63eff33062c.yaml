    of Fish and Game (CDFG) personnel began quarterly sampling of Salton Sea fish at
    fourteen stations around the sea, as the basis of a long term monitoring program.
    To allow comparison of current and future monitoring efforts by CDFG to past results,
    the protocol was adapted from those previously used by researchers at the Salton
    Sea. Each quarter, if conditions allow, this protocol will produce about 816 net-hours
    of sampling. To date data collection was started in the spring of 2003, continuing
    quarterly. Data collection is ongoing as of 2008. Two seasons were missed due to
    unavailability of launch sites: Fall 2007 and Winter 2007. *Note: This dataset should
    be viewed with the 'Quarterly Water Quality Surveys - Salton Sea [ds429]' dataset.
    Methods: The 11 sampling sites comprise three broad habitat types: pelagic (3 sites),
    near-shore (8 sites), and estuarine (3 sites). The pelagic sites are in the approximate
    middles of the north basin, south basin and inter-basin areas of the Sea. The near-shore
    sites are spaced widely apart, four each, near the west and east shores, to capture
    as much breadth of habitat as possible. The estuarine sites are in the body of the
    Sea, close enough to the mouths of the New, Alamo, and Whitewater Rivers, to be
    under the influence of their outflows. Sampling takes place during each of the putative
    seasons, as follows: spring- April and May; summer- July and August; fall- October
    and November; winter- January and February. We attempt to compress the total sampling
    period into as few days as possible, to the extent that the weather, equipment maintenance,
    and personnel scheduling constraints allow. Nets are typically set at one or two
    sites in the morning, and hauled in after approximately 24 hours. The exact number
    of hours set is recorded for each net, to the nearest quarter-hour. Fish are sampled
    by deploying multi-panel monofilament gill nets with 6 X 30 foot p",nt"license_title":
