    cranes on Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon has declined from 236 pairs in
    1971 to 181 pairs in 1986. Nesting  studies conducted from 1966 to 1987 have repeatedly
    demonstrated that the primary limiting factor for cranes nesting on Malheur Refuge
    is the predation of eggs by ravens, raccoons, and coyotes, and the predations on
    prefledged chicks by coyotes. On 21 January 1986, Malheur Refuge staff assisted
    by U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) employees
    began controlling predators on approximately 27,000 acres (14%) of Malheur Refuge.
    Recruitment of crane chicks in the predator control area (14.9%) was the highest
    ever recorded on the refuge. Because of the highly successful results recorded in
    1986, the predator control area was expanded in 1987 to include approximately 46%
    (85,000 acres) of the refuge.  In 1987, 460 coyotes were removed by the following
    methods: aerial gunning(80%), calling and shooting (8%), trapping and snares (7%),
    and denning (6%).  An estimated 124 ravens were removed using 124 dozen chicken
    eggs injected with DRC-1339 and an additional 13 ravens were shot. Sixteen raccoons
    were taken by the following methods: snare 3, shooting 3, live trap 3, and leg hold
    trap 7. Overall crane production was 43 chicks, less than the 50 recorded last year
    but above the average annual production of 31. Recruitment was 10.6%, significantly
    higher than average (6.6%) but less than the record of 14.9% recorded in last year's
    predator control area. Additional nesting studies of ducks showed a similar pattern
    i.e., nesting success was well above long term averages but below the high levels
    recorded last year. The one notable exception was Canada geese which had the highest
    nesting success ever recorded on the refuge. The primary factors believed responsible
    for the diminished results in 1987 were: 1) much drier conditions in 1987 which
    reduced nesting habitat for cranes and attracted more coyotes to the refuge from
    adjacent arid areas, 2) slightly higher coyote populations county-wide, 3) less
    intense predator control efforts per acre in 1987 versus 1986, and 4) cool, wet
    weather in June that most likely increased chick mortality. The objectives of the
    1987 effort were to have a nesting success of 75%, fledging success 25%, and recruitment
    15%. The actual outcome was 57%, 17.1%, and 10.6% respectively. All of these outcomes
    were well above long-term averages but below objective levels. Based on these results,
    the 1987 season was judged a limited success. In comparing 1987 results with long
    term averages for nesting success and chick mortality the data suggests that a minimum
    of 17-18 chicks (same as last year) reached flight stage that would not have survived
    without predator control this year. It is recommended that control efforts for 1988
    be held the same as 1987 with an increased effort to be given to all control efforts,
    particularly during April-flay.",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras":
