    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    completed a study of an issue in the flow control valve (FCV) in the Main Propulsion
    System of the Space Shuttle using an adaptive learning method known as Virtual Sensors.
     Virtual Sensors are a class of algorithms that estimate the value of a time series
    given other potentially nonlinearly correlated sensor readings.  In the case presented
    here, the Virtual Sensors algorithm is based on an ensemble learning approach and
    takes sensor readings and control signals as input to estimate the pressure in a
    subsystem of the Main Propulsion System.  Our results indicate that this method
    can detect faults in the FCV at the time when they occur.  We use the standard deviation
    of the predictions of the ensemble as a measure of uncertainty in the estimate.
     This uncertainty estimate was crucial to understanding the nature and magnitude
    of transient characteristics during startup of the engine.   This paper overviews
    the Virtual Sensors algorithm and discusses results on a comprehensive set of Shuttle
    missions and also discusses the architecture necessary for deploying such algorithms
    in a real-time, closed-loop system or a human-in-the-loop monitoring system. These
    results were presented at a Flight Readiness Review of the Space Shuttle in early
    2009.",nt"owner_org": "d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed",nt"extras":
