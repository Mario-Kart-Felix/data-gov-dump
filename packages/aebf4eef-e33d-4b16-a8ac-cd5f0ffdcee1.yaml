    2 Cloud Data Product OMCLDRR is made available (in April 2012) to the public from
    the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC).
    http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/omcldrr_v003.shtml ) Aura OMI provides two Level-2
    Cloud products (OMCLDRR and OMCLDO2) at pixel resolution (13 x 24 km at nadir) that
    are based on two different algorithms, the Rotational Raman Scattering method and
    the O2-O2 absorption method. This level-2 global cloud product (OMCLDRR) provides
    effective cloud pressure and effective cloud fraction that is based on the least
    square fitting of the Ring spectrum (filling-in of Fraunhofer lines in the range
    392 to 398 nm due to rotational Raman scattering). This product also contains many
    ancillary and derived parameters, terrain and geolocation information, solar and
    satellite viewing angles, and quality flags. The shortname for this Level-2 OMI
    Cloud Pressure and Fraction product is OMCLDRR and the algorithm lead for this product
    is NASA OMI scientist Dr. Joanna Joinner. OMCLDRR files are stored in EOS Hierarchical
    Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit
    (53 minutes). There are approximately 14 orbits per day. The maximum file size for
    the OMCLDRR data product is about 9 Mbytes. A list of tools for browsing and extracting
    data from these files can be found at: http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/tools.shtml
    . A short OMCLDRR Readme Document that includes brief algorithm description and
    data quality is also provided by the OMCLDRR Algorithm lead. The Ozone Monitoring
    Instrument (OMI) was launched aboard the EOS-Aura satellite on July 15, 2004(1:38
    pm equator crossing time, ascending mode). OMI with its 2600 km viewing swath width
    provides almost daily global coverage. OMI is a contribution of the Netherlands
    Agency for Aerospace Programs (NIVR)in collaboration with Finish Meterological Institute
    (FMI), to the US EOS-Aura Mission. OMI is designed to monitor stratospheric and
    tropospheric ozone, clouds, aerosols and smoke from biomass burning, SO2 from volcanic
    eruptions, and key tropospheric pollutants (HCHO, NO2) and ozone depleting gases
    (OClO and BrO). OMI sensor counts, calibrated and geolocated radiances, and all
    derived geophysical atmospheric products are archived at the NASA GES DISC. For
    more information on Ozone Monitoring Instrument and atmospheric data products, please
    visit the OMI-Aura sites: http://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/instruments/omi/ http://www.knmi.nl/omi/research/documents/
    . Data Category Parameters: The OMCLDRR data file contains one swath which consists
    of two groups: Data fields: Two Effective Cloud Fraction and two Cloud Top Pressures
    that are based on two different clear and cloudy scene reflectivity criteria, Chlorophyll
    Amount, Effective Reflectivity (394.1 micron), UV Aerosol Index (based on 360 and
    388 nm), and many Auxiliary Algorithm Parameter and Quality Flags. Geolocation Fields:
    Latitude, Longitude, Time, Solar Zenith Angle, Viewing Zenith Angle, Relative Azimuth
    Angle, Terrain Height, and Ground Pixel Quality Flags. OMI Atmospheric data and
    documents are available from the following sites: http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
