    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;The areal density of solar sails
    and laser sails is large due to the heavy support structure made of Mylar, Kapton
    or CP-1. Replacing this support structure with graphene essentially eliminates this
    mass resulting in a 87&#37; weight savings compared to traditional solar sails,
    given that graphene is one-atom thick. This weight savings allows for more payload
    mass, greater acceleration or a combination of the two.&amp;nbsp; This project will
    investigate if graphene can be used as the solar sail support structure and if significant
    improvements in areal density can be achieved.&amp;nbsp; The objective of the project
    is to show feasibility of fabricating light sails by coating a thin layer of metal
    on a graphene support structure to obtain low area density sails.&amp;nbsp; Graphene
    is a single atom thick layer of carbon which is invisible to the naked eye. It often
    comes on a metal substrate such as nickel or copper.&amp;nbsp; The graphene will
    be characterized by using Raman Spectroscopy to determine the quality and coverage
    of the surface.&amp;nbsp; Our approach will use the substrate as a support structure
    by covering the metal on the edges so the middle section is etched away when it
    is suspended in the etchant, leaving a free graphene layer suspended in air.&amp;nbsp;
    This graphene will then be coated with a thin layer of metal by sputter coating
    a 100 or 50 nm thick layer.&amp;nbsp; Another approach will be to first sputter
    coat the metal and them etch away the nickel or copper substrate.&amp;nbsp; The
    edges of the substrate will be covered by tape and the middle section will be etched
    away.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Future work will consist of developing low areal density
    sails with high-reflectivity and high-temperature optimized to enable the highest
    possible acceleration both for solar and laser sails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both methods
    were attempted and the second method enabled us to fabricate the sail.&amp;nbsp;
    Some of the challenges found in the process was the surface tension in the etchant
    which tended to pull on the graphene causing it to break away from the substrate
    and float on the surface.&amp;nbsp; Graphene typically has many cracks and imperfections
    which we believe enabled the material to separate away coupled with the chemical
    process.&amp;nbsp; After modifying the approach, we were able to make some sail
    samples which we tested using Raman Spectroscopy.&amp;nbsp; The metal sail layer
    does shield out the Raman Spectroscopy signature of the graphene so verification
    of the graphene was not completely possible since the signature was shielded out,
    but some evidence was apparent.&amp;nbsp; An attempt was made to use AFM to verify
    that the graphene layer exists and supports the metal layer, but technical issues
    with the Atomic force microscopy (AFM) prevented us from obtaining results.&amp;nbsp;
    Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) was used to quantify the optical transmissivity
    at various wavelengths, which was very low at about 2&#37;.&amp;nbsp; The optical
    reflectometer&amp;nbsp; was not operational due to a recent failure in the system,
    so no true values on reflectivity were obtained.&amp;nbsp; Once this equipment is
    operational, testing will be conducted on the reflectance of the material.&amp;nbsp;
    The work is significant because it lays the groundwork for interstellar precursor
    missions for human exploration.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
