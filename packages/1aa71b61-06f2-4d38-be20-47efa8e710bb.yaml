    and Biodiversity The intent of this issue is to: Identify the areas of greatest
    conservation value for wildlife habitat and plant and animal biodiversity, and where
    management can enhance these values. Multiple data layers informed this issue. Data
    used: 1. Fish Distribution, comprised of: a. Bull Trout Fish Distribution b. Cutthroat
    Trout distribution c. Chinook Salmon distribution d. Steelhead Salmon distribution
    e. Sockeye Salmon distribution All fish distribution data came from Streamnet (http://www.streamnet.org/mapping_apps.cfm).
    The data represent current distribution and activity for the above species. More
    information on creation of this feature class is available at http://www.streamnet.org/about.html.
    Distribution data for each species was buffered by 75 feet on any critical habitat
    stream, river, or lake. These buffered layers were then converted into a 30 m raster
    grid and re-classed to either a 1 (presence) or 0 (absence). The final fish distribution
    map was derived by adding up the five sub layers and reclassifying 0 through 5 based
    on the number of separate species represented in each pixel. 2. Comprehensive Wildlife
    Conservation Strategy (CWCS) Focal Areas and Big Game a. Focal Areas from the Idaho
    CWCS (http://fishandgame.idaho.gov/ifwis/ifwisweb/IDCWCS/FA/) Through the workshop
    process, Idaho conservation partners mapped and attributed focal areas across Idaho.
    These are general areas known to be important for the species of greatest conservation
    need identified in the Idaho Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy, but by
    no means are intended to imply that conservation actions should be restricted to
    these areas. Focal areas were defined as resource-based, management-based, or both:
    Resource Focal Area: A geographical area necessary for the long-term persistence
    of SGCN and their habitats (in other planning efforts these may be referred to as
    High Resource Value Areas or Biologically Important Areas). Management Focal Area:
    A general geographical area that targets resources and efforts where they can benefit
    the largest number of species and habitats in need of conservation. Management focal
    areas are generally larger and may include species and/or habitats other than SGCN
    as well as non-biological factors. Focal areas were classified by their type, converted
    to 30m raster, and reclassified as: 0 where none exist, 1 where it is a resource
    Focal Area, and 3 if it is a Management Focal Area. b. Big Game Habitat from Idaho
    Fish and Game, including: i. Mule Deer - Concentrated Winter Range & Critical Habitat
    ii. Elk - Critical Summer and Winter Range iii. Mountain Goat - Habitat v. Bighorn
    Sheep - Priority Habitat Species were selected, and data provided by the Idaho Fish
    and Game Department. These species represent the most critical big game species
    per the CWCS. Each species habitat/range was converted to 30m raster and classified
    as 1 where the species exists, and 0 where it doesn't. The scores from both a) and
    b) above were added together. Pixels could have a score from 0 to 7. These were
    reclassified by natural breaks into five classes, 0 through 5. 3. The Nature Conservancy
    Ecoregional Conservation and Priority Conservation Areas, comprised of: a. Canadian
    Rocky Mountains Ecoregional Assessment Data - Priority Conservation Areas. This
    data is access restricted. Information on the assessment, including report, maps
    and data can be accessed at: (http://www.waconservation.org/ecoCanadianRockies.shtml)
    b. Columbia Plateau Ecoregional Assessment Data - Priority Conservation Areas. This
    data is access restricted. Information on the assessment, including the report,
    maps and data can be accessed at: (http://www.waconservation.org/ecoColumbiaPlateau.shtml)
    c. Middle Rockies - Blue Mountains Ecoregional Assessment Data - Conservation Areas.
    The assessment report and data can be accessed at: (http://www.waconservation.org/ecoBlueMountains.shtml)
    d. Utah - Wyoming Rocky Mountains Ecoregional Assessment Data - Conservation Areas.
    The assessment report can be accessed at: (http://www.conservationgateway.org/Pages/default.aspx)
    The metadata for Conservation Area datasets describes them as: These data describe
    the priority areas for conserving imperiled species and functioning ecosystems.
    These extraordinary places are all part of a common "ecoregion", sharing similar
    climate, geologic historic, landforms, and native species. Resources for conservation
    in these ecoregions are limited, urban areas are expanding, and an extraordinary
    heritage of native species and ecosystems is at risk. This assessment is intended
    to help conservation agencies, planners, and organizations direct their resources
    to the most important places for conservation. It describes a "portfolio" of priority
    conservation areas which are 1) of exceptional biological value and 2) the most
    likely places for conservation to succeed based on their current condition, land
    use, and other factors. Most importantly, this portfolio captures as much of the
    biodiversity of the ecoregion as possible, ensuring that each local site contributes
    to an ecoregion-wide strategy for conservation. While all identified conservation
    areas are considered priority, these area within the first two datasets (a. and
    b.) were further refined to include those which are most important and/or at highest
    risk. Because datasets c. and d. did not further prioritize conservation areas,
    there may be more identified conservation areas relative to the other two. For this
    reason, all areas were combined, converted to a 30m raster grid. Pixels were classified
    with a value of 3 if they were a conservation or high conservation area per the
    datasets used, and 0 if they did not. 4. Federally Listed Threatened and Endangered
    Species, from the Idaho Conservation Data Center, Idaho Department of Fish and Game-from
    2007. The occurrences represent Federally Listed Threatened and Endangered in Idaho.
    This spatial coverage and the occurrences contained in it are not a public record.
    Data were converted to 30m raster pixels, and classified with a 1 if a T&E species
    exists, and 0 if not. These species are listed at the end of this document. Final
    Relative Benefit to Wildlife and Biodiversity map: The four layers listed above
    were added together and reclassified by natural breaks into five classes indicating
    low to high relative benefit to Wildlife and Biodiversity. Species listed in Idaho
    based on published population data Notes: This report shows the species listed in
    this state according to the Federal Register listing description. This list does
