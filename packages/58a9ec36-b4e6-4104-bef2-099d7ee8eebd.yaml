  unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
  thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
  years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
  we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
  to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
  in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
  to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
  air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
  Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
  spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
  explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
  and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
  rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
  expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
  NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
  to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
  around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
  continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
  Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
  Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
  such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"title\": \"National

  based maintenance (CBM) of critical systems. Along with developing the fundamentals
  of being able to confidently predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL), the technology
  calls for fielded applications as it inches towards maturation. This requires a
  stringent performance evaluation so that the significance of the concept can be
  fully exploited. Currently, prognostics concepts lack standard definitions and suffer
  from ambiguous and inconsistent interpretations. This lack of standards is in part
  due to the varied end-user requirements for different applications, time scales,
  available information, domain dynamics, etc. to name a few issues. Instead, the
  research community has used a variety of metrics based largely on convenience with
  respect to their respective requirements. Very little attention has been focused
  on establishing a common ground to compare different efforts. This paper surveys
  the metrics that are already used for prognostics in a variety of domains including
  medicine, nuclear, automotive, aerospace, and electronics. It also considers other
  domains that involve prediction-related tasks, such as weather and finance.  Differences
  and similarities between these domains and health maintenance have been analyzed
  to help understand what performance evaluation methods may or may not be borrowed.
  Further, these metrics have been categorized in several ways that may be useful
  in deciding upon a suitable subset for arnspecific application. Some important prognostic
  concepts have been defined using a notational framework that enables interpretation
  of different metrics coherently. Last, but not the rnleast, a list of metrics has
  been suggested to assess critical aspects of RUL predictions before they are fielded
  in real applications.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed\",\n\t\"extras\":
