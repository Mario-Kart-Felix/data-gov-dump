    Earth Probe (EP) Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) for the period of August
    8-September 29, 2000 were processed and provided by the Atmospheric Chemistry and
    Dynamics Branch at NASA/GSFC for the SAFARI 2000 Dry Season Aircraft Campaign.The
    TTO measurement is derived from TOMS total ozone (Thompson and Hudson, 1999; Thompson
    et al., 2001) using the modified-residual method to separate stratospheric ozone
    from tropospheric ozone. The tropospheric ozone column thickness is reported in
    Dobson Units (DU).EP TOMS is currently the only NASA spacecraft on orbit specializing
    in ozone retrieval. EP TOMS was launched in 1996 into an orbit 500 km rather than
    the 950 km that was originally planned. The Earth Probe satellite was boosted to
    740 km in 1997 when the ADEOS satellite failed. The lower orbit of EP TOMS decreased
    the size of the footprint of each measurement, which increased the resolution and
    also increased the ability to make measurements over cloudless scenes. This orbit
    was chosen to improve the ability of the TOMS instrument to make measurements of
    UV-absorbing aerosols in the troposphere and enhanced the capability of converting
    the TOMS aerosol measurements into geophysical quantities such as optical depth.
    Tropospheric aerosols play a major role in the Earth's climate and the capability
    to measure them from a TOMS instrument had recently been developed using data from
    Nimbus-7 and Meteor-3 TOMS.The TOMS Tropospheric Ozone data are 9-day averaged,
    gridded (1-degree by 2-degree) ASCII products. There is also a GIF image of each
    data file. ",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
