    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Background:The Biological Monitoring Program
    is a part of the Western Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation
    Plan (MSHCP), which was permitted in June, 2004. The Monitoring Program monitors
    the status of 146 Covered Species within a designated Conservation Area to provide
    information to permittees, land managers, the public, and wildlife agencies (i.e.,
    the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service).
    Monitoring Program activities are guided by MSHCP species objectives for each covered
    species, the information needs identified in Section 5.3 of the MSHCP (http://www.rctlma.org/mshcp/volume1/sec5.html#5.3)
    or elsewhere in the document, and the information needs of the permittees. The Biological
    Monitoring Program seeks to provide sufficient scientifically reliable data to assess
    the MSHCP's effectiveness at meeting resource objectives and achieving or maintaining
    a healthy MSHCP Conservation Area in perpetuity. This dataset includes all records
    of animal species that were acquired during formal surveys for MSHCP-Covered Species
    conducted by the Biological Monitoring Program within the MSHCP Conservation Area
    between 2005-2014.Purpose:This dataset is intended for distribution to BIOS and
    public users of this database as documentation of species presence at a specific
    place and time. These data are useful for satisfying MSHCP species-specific objectives,
    modeling species-habitat associations, documenting species distributions, and any
    other presence-only data applications.Data assumptions and limitations:We assumed
    that all observers were equally capable of confirming all target species for each
    taxa-specific survey activity after completing training exercises and passing any
    required species-identification tests. If known, surveys were conducted within the
    optimal range of dates, times, and weather conditions to maximize target species
    detection probability. These data have all been proofed after entry and are now
    assumed to be free from data entry error. However, if an observer recorded data
    incorrectly in the field it is possible that those errors persist in this dataset.
    This is a presence-only dataset. Because the lack of recorded species observations
    in a given area may be the result of a lack of surveys in that area or the failure
    to detect a species during a survey when it is actually present, true absence is
    not implied by this dataset and should not be inferred.Known caveats of the data:The
    Accuracy field describes the maximum potential amount of error in the geographic
    coordinates associated with each observation record. The magnitude of potential
    error for any observation is the result of survey protocol decisions made to increase
    data collection efficiency and vary across taxa.Some observation records were omitted
    from this dataset because an accurate identification could not be made to the species,
    subspecies, or variety level. Others were omitted because their coordinates fell
    beyond 30 meters of the September 2014 Conservation Area boundary.Observations of
    humans recorded in camera station photographs were also omitted. If users of this
    dataset are interested in these observations, please contact the Biological Monitoring
    Program.Supplemental Information:Because many survey protocols involve gathering
    data for a specified period of time at a single location, and because survey locations
    are often repeatedly visited in a given year, many observation locations have multiple
    observations of the same species or of different species. Additional information
    and data collected during these surveys (e.g., notes made in the field, environmental
    conditions and habitat condition made at the time of observation) and about the
    survey efforts that produced these data are available by request from the Monitoring
    Program and are summarized where relevant in annually distributed survey summary
    reports.Spatial data capture methods: All spatial data were either recorded in the
    field using a hand-held GPS unit, digitized in ArcGIS, or generated with specialized
    computer software. Coordinates obtained by GPS were recorded on paper datasheets
    and entered by hand into the database in the office. Data generated by computer
    software consist of points, straight-lines, or defined-area polygons that were used
    to map and locate sampling stations in the field. Station names and coordinates
    were uploaded digitally into the Biological Monitoring Programu2019s central database
    and joined through station name to results of surveys conducted at those locations.",nt"license_title":
