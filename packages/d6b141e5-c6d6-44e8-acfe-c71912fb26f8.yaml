    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "A multifaceted study of the sediment dwelling
    benthos was conducted in Mamala Bay to identify suitable species as indicators of
    sewage enrichment. There are five components to this study - 1) reproduction and
    life histories of potential indicator species, 2) seasonal abundance of each indicator
    species near the outfall and at the control site (Diamond Head) at 70m depth, 3)
    abundance and species richness of indicators and associated benthos at 6 sites and
    the control at 40m depth, 4) sediment grain size analyses at each site to characterize
    the infaunal habitat, 5) CHN and Nitrogen analyses from the study area to elucidate
    the role of sewage in the organic content of the sediments. Each component is presented
    as a separate section as methods and analyses differ for each. This same format
    is used for the appendices. Sediment samples (7.6cm diam x 5.0cm depth) were collected
    with a Van Veen grab from 40m and 70m stations. Live worms were removed from freshly
    collected sediment and cultured in the laboratory for developmental and life history
    information. Reproductive data was gathered for designated indicator species, (Neanthes
    arenaceodonta, Capitella capitata, Pionosyllis heterocirrata and Ophryotrocha sp.
    A). N. arenaceodonta was not successfully cultured as only two individuals were
    found. Progeny were obtained for the three others and Ophryotrocha sp. A was the
    most successful in culture. Seasonal abundance of indicators at the outfall (B3)
    and control site show that all indicator species are more abundant at B3, and in
    the summer months than at Diamond Head, or during winter months. P. heterocirrata
    is widely distributed throughout the year and Ophryotrocha sp. A was only found
    at the deep outfall site in any number. Community studies based on preserved samples
    collected in the same way from the 40m (S series) stations show abundant and species
    assemblages at all stations, including the control. Overall polychaete abundances
    are higher at 40m stations than near the outfall and exceeded the abundance estimates
    at the control. Species richness estimates show some site by site variation but
    all stations are specious and often exceed the control. Differences are seen between
    the dominant species groups at outfall and 40m far field stations. The more westerly
    sites had more tubicolous and particle feeding worms (sabellids and oweniids) than
    the stations closest to the outfall (substantiated by historical data base, biomonitoring
    program), and a different community was evident at east Mamala site S6 and the control.
    Grain size analyses show higher proportions of fine particles (clay and silt) at
    the westerly stations which receive input from Pearl Harbor and Keehi Lagoon. This
    may provide an explanation for the larger number of tubicolous worms which use fine
    particles for tube building. A larger proportion of coarse and fine sand were present
    in east Mamala sediments and may have partially determined the polychaete communities
    at those sites. There is not enough data for the CHN and N signature analyses to
    provide definitive results, but preliminary information does not implicate the outfall
    as a major source of nitrogen. Indicator worm abundance seems to be a better measure
    of food availability as their numbers are highest at the outfall stations (for 40m
    and 70m). Abundance of the indicator species, Ophryotrocha sp. A, at 70m is elevated
    at the outfall (B3) and can be attributed to food availability and other appropriate
    habitat characteristics. Neanthes arenaceodonta is not abundant enough to be a good
    indicator at 70m at this time, Pionosyllis heterocirrata is so widespread and numerous
    that it is not a good indicator of sewage enrichment. Capitella capitata is generally
    more abundant at 40m and only abundant at 70m in the summer, and may be a suitable
    indicator species. Sensitive species are also candidates for pollution indicators
    when they are rare or absent from an area. Euchone sp. B may be a sensitive species
    as it is abundant in near and far field stations, but not numerous near the outfall.
    Ophryotrocha sp. A seems to be the best benthic indicator and most promising for
    future Mamala Bay benthic studies. This species was absent, or virtually absent
    from outfield and control sites, but abundant at the outfall. Recommendations include
    adding the 40m stations to routine biomonitoring and improving the techniques to
    differentiate terrigenous and sewage derived sources of nitrogen.",nt"license_title":
