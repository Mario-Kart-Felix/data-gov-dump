    of carbon dioxide (CO2) and non-CO2 greenhouse gases made across North America by
    nine independent atmospheric monitoring networks from 2000 - 2009. During this North
    American Carbon Program (NACP) sponsored activity, data were compiled from the following
    networks: AGAGE, COBRA, CSIRO, INTEX-A, INTEX B, Irvine Latitude Network, NOAA CMDL,
    SCRIPPS, and Stanley Tyler-UC Irvine. The files presented here are the products
    of merging multiple original measurement results files for selected sites across
    North America from each monitoring network. The primary focus of this effort was
    the compilation of non-CO2 greenhouse gases over North America, but numerous CO2
    observations are also included. The data files for each network are accompanied
    by detailed readme documentation files prepared by the respective network investigators.
    Project descriptions, objectives, references, sampling and analysis methods, and
    data file descriptions are included in these READMEs. Table 1 in the documentation
    displays the monitoring network sites, sample types, analytes, and links to the
    detailed network README files. Network- and laboratory-specific data citations are
    included in the README documentation and should be used to acknowledge the use of
    these data as appropriate. The data files for each monitoring network and each sampling
    type (continuous or flasks) have been combined into one compressed (*.zip) file
    along with the detailed README document. There are 17 compressed files that when
    expanded contain data files which represent one years data for that specific campaign
    and sampling method. The number of annual files that were compiled from a network
    into this collection varies.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
