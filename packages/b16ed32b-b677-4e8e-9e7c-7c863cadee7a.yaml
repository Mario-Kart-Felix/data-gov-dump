    System (WIMAS) is an ArcView based GIS application that allows users to query Kansas
    water right data maintained by the Kansas Department of Agriculture, Division of
    Water Resources (KDA-DWR). Using a shape file representing points of water diversion
    that is developed from SQL queries to the KDA-DWR's ORACLE-based Water Rights Information
    System (WRIS), WIMAS users can summarize total authorized quantity and annual reported
    water usage for Kansas counties, subbasins, user-defined study areas, or individual
    water rights. WIMAS consists of two customized Graphical User Interfaces and several
    forms developed from Avenue and the Dialog Designer Extension for ArcView. The output
    options of WIMAS allows users to print hardcopy outputs or export their queries
    into other applications in the form of text reports, graphs, and maps.",nt"license_title":

    for ArcView installed in a Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 environment. Information
    contained in the WIMAS program is a public record; however, by accessing the WIMAS
    program, associated data, and any products generated by WIMAS (i.e. maps, graphs,
    tables, and reports) the user agrees that they will not use them for selling, or
    offering the sale, of any property or services in violation of K.S.A 45-220(c)(2).
    The use of the PD.SHP file outside of the WIMAS program is strongly discouraged
    without a strong understanding of both water rights in general and the KDA-DWR's
    ORACLE database modeling rules and structure. Water rights are dynamic and often
    complex entities. The water rights data used in WIMAS represents the water rights
    files as of certain date and should not be viewed as current. Reported water use
    information used in WIMAS at this time represents only a single calender year. Information
    provided in WIMAS can not be used to determine whether a water right has been lawfully
    used in accordance with the terms, conditions and limitations specified in the vested
    right, certificate or permit. To obtain current standing information on a particular
    water right file, please contact the DWR. The term "status", as used in the WIMAS
    program, denotes one of the following phases of a water right's development: (1)
    The application is pending initial review by the KDA-DWR; (2) A permit has been
    issued; (3) The KDA-DWR has received a notice and proof of completion of the diversion
    works; (4) The time to perfect the water right has expired; (5) A Certificate of
    Appropriation has been issued; or (6) The water right has been dismissed for some
