    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Successes to date with the use of integrated
    software framework tools have led NASA engineers and other researchers to expand
    the breadth, depth, and sophistication of the problems that they are attempting
    to solve. Both the utilization of "high-fidelity" physics based models ("depth")
    and the total number of different engineering disciplines included in system models
    ("breadth") have steadily increased. As model size and complexity grows, the number
    of engineers involved in the development and maintenance of these models is also
    increasing. Increases in system model size and complexity and the corresponding
    need for collaborative model development are beginning to stretch the limits of
    existing software frameworks. Large models are more difficult to build and maintain,
    while the inclusion of more people in the development process leads to model management
    and coordination issues. Enhanced and improved framework tools are required if NASA
    and industry are to continue to expand their modeling, simulation, and design capabilities.
    In this project, Phoenix Integration will develop an innovative software environment
    that will allow individual engineers and collaborative engineering teams to better
    build and manage large, complex, system models. Key elements in the solution include
    a new infrastructure for hierarchical model building (models within models), enhanced
    data linking and model verification tools, and an integrated version-controlled
    model and data library. These tools will combine to provide NASA engineers with
    a powerful and flexible environment for creating, maintaining, and collaborating
    on the creation, execution, and maintenance of large and complex system models.

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
