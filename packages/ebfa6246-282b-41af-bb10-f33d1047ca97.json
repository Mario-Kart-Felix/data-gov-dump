	"notes": "\"We are proposing a new concept of integrated component development technology at submillimeter wavelengths that will dramatically simplify the fabrication, assembly, and integration of large focal plane arrays and imagers. This technology has the potential to significantly increase the pixel count of detector arrays and reduce the mass, volume, and complexity of array receivers for a broad range of applications in astrophysics and earth sciences. \n\n\n\nWe will develop and demonstrate a highly integrated silicon-micromachined array receiver at  1.9 THz based on advanced dual-polarized, sideband-separating, balanced heterodyne mixers. The receiver front-end will be integrated with a novel micro-lens antenna array. We will design full-waveguide-band 90-degree quadrature hybrids, orthomode transducers (OMT), polarization twists, in-phase power splitters, and directional couplers at 1.9 THz; fabricate them using deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) based silicon micromachining, integrate them with existing HEB mixers at 1.9 THz; and test and fully characterize them in our laboratory.\n\n\n\nThe scientific importance of high-resolution spectroscopic observations at submillimeter wavelengths is underscored by the key role of heterodyne spectrometers in the ESA cornerstone Herschel Space Observatory as well as the ground-based ALMA and airborne SOFIA.  Star formation and key phases of galaxy evolution occur in region enshrouded by dust that obscures them at infrared and optical wavelengths, while the temperature range of the interstellar medium of ten to a few thousand Kelvin in these regions excites a wealth of submillimeter-wave spectral lines. With high-resolution spectroscopy, resolved line profiles reveal the dynamics of star formation, directly revealing details of turbulence, outflows, and core collapse.  Observations of emission from ionized species such as C+ at 1900.53690 GHz (158 um), allow one to directly measure the cooling of the diffuse component of the interstellar m",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
