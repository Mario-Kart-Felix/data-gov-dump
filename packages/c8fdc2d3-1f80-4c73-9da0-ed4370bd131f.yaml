    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "An optimal alarm system is simply an optimal
    level-crossing predictor that can be designed to elicit the fewest false alarms
    for a fixed detection probability. It currently use Kalman filtering for dynamic
    systems to provide a layer of predictive capability for the forecasting of adverse
    events. Predicted Kalman filter future process values and a fixed critical threshold
    can be used to construct a candidate level-crossing event over a predetermined prediction
    window. rnrnDue to the fact that the alarm regions for an optimal level-crossing
    predictor cannot be expressed in closed form, one of our aims has been to investigate
    approximations for the design of an optimal alarm system. Approximations to this
    sort of alarm region are required for the most computationally efficient generation
    of a ROC curve or other similar alarm system design metrics. rnrnAlgorithms based
    upon the optimal alarm system concept also require models that appeal to a variety
    of data mining and machine learning techniques. As such, we have investigated a
    serial architecture which was used to preprocess a full feature space by using SVR
    (Support Vector Regression), implicitly reducing it to a univariate signal while
    retaining salient dynamic characteristics (see AIAA attachment below). This step
    was required due to current technical constraints, and is performed by using the
    residual generated by SVR (or potentially any regression algorithm) that has properties
    which are favorable for use as training data to learn the parameters of a linear
    dynamical system.rnrnFuture development will lift these restrictions so as to allow
    for exposure to a broader class of models such as a switched multi-input/output
    linear dynamical system in isolation based upon heterogeneous (both discrete and
    continuous) data, obviating the need for the use of a preprocessing regression algorithm
    in serial. However, the use of a preprocessing multi-input/output nonlinear regression
    algorithm in serial with a multi-input/output linear dynamical system will allow
    for the characterization of underlying static nonlinearities to be investigated
    as well. We will even investigate the use of non-parametric methods such as Gaussian
    process regression and particle filtering in isolation to lift the linear and Gaussian
    assumptions which may be invalid for many applications. rnrnFuture work will also
    involve improvement of approximations inherent in use of the optimal alarm system
    of optimal level-crossing predictor. We will also perform more rigorous testing
    and validation of the alarm systems discussed by using standard machine learning
    techniques and consider more complex, yet practically meaningful critical level-crossing
    events. Finally, a more detailed investigation of model fidelity with respect to
    available data and metrics has been conducted (see attachment below). As such, future
    work on modeling will involve the investigation of necessary improvements in initialization
    techniques and data transformations for a more feasible fit to the assumed model
    structure. Additionally, we will explore the integration of physics-based and data-driven
    methods in a Bayesian context, by using a more informative prior.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
