  life of power MOSFETs (metal oxide field effect transistor) devices has been developed.
  Power MOSFETs are semiconductor switching devices that are instrumental in electronics
  equipment such as those used in operation and control of modern aircraft and spacecraft.
  The MOSFETs examined here were aged under thermal overstress in a controlled experiment
  and continuous performance degradation data were collected from the accelerated
  aging experiment. Die-attach degradation was determined to be the primary failure
  mode. The collected run-to-failure data were analyzed and it was revealed that ON-state
  resistance increased as die-attach degraded under high thermal stresses. Results
  from finite element simulation analysis support the observations from the experimental
  data. Data-driven and model based prognostics algorithms were investigated where
  ON-state resistance was used as the primary precursor of failure feature. A Gaussian
  process regression algorithm was explored as an example for a data-driven technique
  and an extended Kalman filter and a particle filter were used as examples for model-based
  techniques. Both methods were able to provide valid results. Prognostic performance
  metrics were employed to evaluate and compare the algorithms.\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
