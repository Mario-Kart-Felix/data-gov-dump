    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the viability of
    this technology, a prototype Natural User Interface (NUI) was developed as a proof-of-concept
    for system control.&amp;nbsp; Gesture and voice controls were developed and compared.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    Both methods of control input allowed the user to be in a general area as opposed
    to a specific location.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Voice input highlighted the ability
    to achieve truly hands-free interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prototype provided
    for control of a simplistic lighting system and cabin temperature control system
    which represented a typical space habitat system requiring interaction.&amp;nbsp;
    The user interacted with the system through a Microsoft Kinect sensor which includes
    an infrared light source and receiver and array microphone capability.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    Code was developed in conjunction with the skeleton tracking and speech recognition
    capabilities in the software development kit to allow the use of gestures and speech
    as a source of input.&amp;nbsp; To allow the user to monitor system response and
    to &amp;#39;see&amp;#39; the results of their commands, a simple set of graphical
    user interfaces (GUIs) were developed to include the logical equivalent of commands
    and telemetry feedback.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In addition, an end effector unit was
    developed using an Arduino microprocessor which received serial port inputs from
    the application software to control light emitting diodes which represented habitat
    light systems and a servo motor which represented an air mixing valve that might
    be used to support temperature control setpoint.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To
    interact with the system, the user began with a main display where they could navigate
    to the lighting controls display and a thermal control display.&amp;nbsp; The lighting
    controls consisted of on-off buttons for three areas of the simulated habitat (lab,
    crew quarters, airlock). Using voice commanding, the user could control the lights
    in each habitation area (e.g., &amp;ldquo;lab off&amp;rdquo; would select the off
    button). Gesture control employed both the left and right arms. Once the participant
    told the system to track their arm, a focus box would move over the lighting controls
    as controlled by the left hand. Once the focus box was over the desired on-off control,
    the button would be activated by a wave of the right hand. On the thermal control
    screen, a slider was shown with setpoint values ranging from 62 and 82 degrees.
    Using simple voice commands such as &amp;ldquo;temp 70&amp;rdquo;, the setpoint
    indicator would move to that temperature. When the participant told the system to
    track the hand, the slider would move in parallel with the right hand. To stay at
    a specific temperature, the participant simply told the system to stop tracking.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    The appropriate lights on the end-effector unit would turn on/off consistent with
    the GUI indications and the servo would move to a position in its range of motion
    that was scaled to be consistent with the temperature setpoint command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Development,
    test and evaluation of this small system emphasized the importance of designing
    it in a way that ensures the actions the system takes are consistent with the intent
    of the user and that the application software contains logic necessary to correctly
    interpret the sensed inputs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is particularly challenging
    to accomplish while trying to ensure that the gestures and voice commands remain
    natural and easily remembered/applied.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It was also important
    to allow the user to enable/disable the processing of voice/gesture at any given
    time during use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through this project we have identified the need
    to investigate and develop gesture and voice &amp;#39;vocabularies&amp;#39; that
    will be perceived as natural and easily remembered by users.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    We have also determined that design approaches using mode control are relevant but
    require additional considerations when using one or more NUI input modalities.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    Progressively more complex system development would be the best approach to mature
    the design practices required for spacecraft application.&amp;nbsp; It is understood
    that other options exist for NUI input sensing which may be preferable for certain
    applications. &amp;nbsp; However, it is believed that this forward work&amp;nbsp;
    would apply to alternate NUI input sensing options as well.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
