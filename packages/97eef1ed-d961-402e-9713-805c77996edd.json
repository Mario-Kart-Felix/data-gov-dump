	"notes": "This report documents the results of investigations of the effects of environmental methylmercury on the health, development, survival, and reproduction of long-legged wading birds in the Everglades ecosystem. The project was supported by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and took place between fall 1993 and spring 1997. The research involved both field and lab studies aimed at a variety of questions. The impetus for this work came from recent findings of high levels of methylmercury in upper food chain organisms in the Everglades, and from the realization that so little was known about this contaminant in wild birds that most predictions as to its effects were virtually insupportable. Through analysis of 187 great egret and 51 great blue heron (Ardea herodias) carcasses of various ages, and from captive great egrets dosed with known quantities of mercury, we found that mercury concentrations are generally highest in growing feathers, powderdown, breeding plumes, and nails, with intermediate values in liver, muscle, heart and kidney. Lowest concentrations were found in brain tissue. Mercury concentrations increased significantly with age, both when age groups (nestling, juvenile, adult) are compared, and when nestlings of different ages are compared. During 1994, we measured food consumption, health, and survival of great egret chicks, and examined the influence of mercury concentrations in blood and feathers at approximately 28 days of age, on these variables. We found food consumption decreased significantly with increased feather mercury, though only weak effects were found on health parameters, and no effects on survival through the first 7.5 months of life. The apparent lack of an effect of mercury in these experiments may well have been an artifact of the timing of the dosing (and in 1994, the timing of the assay of mercury body burden), which was during a small portion of the period leading up to independence of the chicks. During this time, feather growth is extremely rapid, and we hypothesized that the effect of apparent body burdens during this time was misleading because much of the mercury ingested is rapidly sequestered into feather tissue, where it was not toxic. We investigated the potential of mercury contamination to affect successful breeding in great blue herons by comparing mercury values from shed breeding plumes at nest sites, with feathers taken from birds in the same area and season that had no evidence of breeding plumage or gonadal enlargement. Generally, successfully breeding birds had higher feather mercury concentrations than nonbreeding birds. The interpretation of this result is unclear. The effects of mercury on great egrets and great blue herons are difficult to extend to other wading bird species except in a qualitative fashion. The literature indicates large differences among avian species in susceptibility to mercury, and we caution that the effects on species that have evolved at or near the top of the food chain may not be applicable to those at lower trophic levels.",
