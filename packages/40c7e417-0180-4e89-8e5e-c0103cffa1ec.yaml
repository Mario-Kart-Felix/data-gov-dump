    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was
    to identify and estimate the cost of one or more approaches of utilizing waste hydrogen
    for power generation. To simplify the scope of the problem, this study was limited
    to the boiloff source of the run tank at one test stand which consistently produces
    500 gallons of hydrogen gas every day. This study used the results of several previous
    studies that also examined different ways of allaying the waste hydrogen problem.
    Using literature from these previous efforts as a starting point, a market review
    was conducted to find potential systems of hydrogen-fueled energy generation that
    are currently available. Candidate systems were considered based upon their compatibility
    with requirements dictated by the test stand and related infrastructure. These requirements
    were developed from technical data and drawings and supplemented with knowledge
    gained during a site visit to the test stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market review
    revealed only a single viable option: a hydrogen-fueled 4.9-L reciprocating engine
    and generator set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-level design of the supporting infrastructure
    was carried out in order to conduct a reasonably accurate cost analysis once a prime
    mover and generator system was selected. Gas and water piping systems were developed,
    electrical equipment needs were identified, and a general site layout determined.
    Cost estimates were then made for materials, equipment, installation labor, maintenance
    and prime contractor expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the performance of the power
    generation system, capital and variable expenditures known, life cycle cost analysis
    metrics were calculated. Impacts of the developed system on the environment were
    also assessed.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
