    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The endangered Wyoming toad (Bufo baxteri)
    is found only as a reintroduced population at Mortenson NWR in the Laramie Plains
    of southeast Wyoming. Reasons for the decline of this amphibian are unknown. Data
    on predation, habitat modification, soil and water conditions (Stone 1991), and
    water quality (Ramirez 1992; Ramirez and Armstrong 1992), are available; but, none
    of these parameters are documented as posing serious threats to the toad. One threat
    that has not been investigated is the potential for agricultural fertilizers containing
    nitrates to enter surface water at Mortenson NWR. Nitrates are transported by irrigation
    runoff and snowmelt during the same time frame as the growth and development period
    of the Wyoming toad (Stone 1991); and, although little information exists on the
    effects of nitrates on amphibians, nitrates are suspected of playing a role in the
    decline of some amphibian populations. Hecnar (1995) suggests that nitrates may
    pose a risk to amphibians that is equivalent to that of pesticides. The current
    water quality guideline for nitrates is 10 mg/L NO3-N (EPA 1986). The purpose of
    this study was to determine the concentrations of nitrates at Mortenson NWR and
    whether these concentrations are potentially affecting the survival of the Wyoming
    toad. Water samples were collected pre-, during, and post-irrigation at Mortenson
    NWR and submitted for general water quality analyses and analysis of nitrite, nitrate,
    and ammonia. Frog embryo teratogenesis assays, using Woodhouse's toad (B. woodhousii)
    embryos as surrogates for the Wyoming toad, were conducted at the Midwest Science
    Center at Columbia, Missouri. Test solutions were prepared using a standard dilution
    series with one dilution representative of nitrate concentrations present in the
    field. Percent mortality, timing of metamorphosis, and presence of deformities were
    measured. Survival and metamorphosis were significantly reduced by the ammonia nitrate
    concentrations at the two highest treatments tested in the assay. The treatment
    representative of ammonia nitrate concentrations found at Mortenson NWR did not
    impact tadpole survival or metamorphosis. Deformities in the tadpoles were observed
    in all treatments including controls. The deformities did not appear to be caused
    by the ammonia nitrate concentrations and may be the result of the tadpoles' diet.
    Results of this study show that ammonia nitrate concentrations are not currently
    elevated to concentrations that would adversely affect the Wyoming toad. Increases
    in nitrogen input, such as what might occur with changes in land use, could increase
    the risk for adverse effects to the toad, particularly because ammonia nitrate concentrations
    may act synergistically with other environmental factors or may serve as a stressor
    for increasing the toads' susceptibility to disease. Periodical sampling of water
    from Mortenson NWR will ensure that nitrogen input does not increase to concentrations
    exceeding the tolerance level of Wyoming toads.",nt"license_title": "License
