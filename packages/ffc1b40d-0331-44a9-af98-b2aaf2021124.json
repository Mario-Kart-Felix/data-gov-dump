	"notes": "The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japan  satellite\n                        mission to monitor tropical and subtropical precipitation. \n                        \n                        The Level 1B product file (1B01) contains calibrated radiances and\n                        auxiliary geolocation information for each pixel in the scan. The\n                        Level 1B data are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), which\n                        includes both core and product specific metadata applicable to the\n                        VIRS measurements. A file contains a single orbit of data with a file\n                        size of about 87 MB (uncompressed). The HDF-EOS &quot;swath&quot; structure is\n                        used to accommodate the actual geophysical data arrays. As in the case\n                        of the Level 1A data, there are 16 files of VIRS 1B01 data\n                        produced per day.\n                        \n                        For channels 1 and 2, Level 1B radiances are derived from the Level 1A\n                        sensor counts by computing calibration parameters (gain and offset)\n                        derived from the counts registered during space and solar and\/or lunar\n                        views. New calibration parameters are produced every 1 to 4\n                        weeks. Bands 3, 4, and 5 are calibrated using the internal blackbody\n                        and the space view. These two data points, together with a quadratic\n                        term determined pre-launch, are used to generate a counts vs. radiance\n                        curve for each band, which is then used to convert the earth-view pixel\n                        counts to spectral radiances.\n                        \n                        For the Level 1B data, geolocation and channel data are written out\n                        for each pixel along the scan, whereas the time stamp, scan status\n                        (containing scan quality information), navigation, calibration\n                        coefficients, and satellite\/ solar geometry are specified on a per-scan\n                        basis. There are in general 18026 scans along the orbit with each scan\n                        consisting of 261 pixels. The scan width is about 720 km.\n                        \n                        Spatial coverage is between 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South\n                        owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite. This orbit\n                        provides extensive coverage in the tropics and allows each location to\n                        be covered at a different local time each day, enabling the analysis\n                        of the diurnal cycle of precipitation.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
