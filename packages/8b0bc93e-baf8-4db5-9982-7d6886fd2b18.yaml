  6 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of selected portions of seafloor around
  Isla de Mona in Puerto Rico, derived from data collected in 2008. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA
  Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory,
  federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in Puerto
  Rico from 2/25/08 to 3/8/08. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad
  EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) in 2008. It was processed by a NOAA contractor
  using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity)
  and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and
  zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 19 north, datum NAD83. The processed
  CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. An ASCII
  XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and imported to ESRI ArcMap 9.2 using
  the 'Convert XYZ to Raster' tool developed by CCMA for this purpose. This was used
  to produce the final Geotiff. The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and
  2 accuracy standards, dependent on the project area and depth. All users should
  individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs
  and standards.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819\",\n\t\"extras\":
