    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The innovation is a Near Infrared Photon-Counting
    Sensor (NIRPCS), an imaging device with sufficient sensitivity to capture the spectral
    signatures, in the wavelength range 0.9-1.7 um from very faint extra-solar targets
    and events with high resolution.  The NIRPCS will have near zero read noise and
    dark rates below the read noise to support photon counting for frame capture times
    as high as 10 seconds.  Up to 10/5 frames can be sequentially captured and digitally
    averaged.  Important NASA applications for the NIRPCS include spectral measurements
    on extra-solar planets in search of water and bio-markers and measuring the dynamics
    of galaxies at high redshift to better understand the formation process.  The technical
    objectives of Phase II are centered on more focused study on the behavior of the
    TE photocathode at the very low cooling temperatures anticipated for the ultimate
    implementation of this sensor technology by NASA for the astronomy application.
    The modeling results of the Phase I effort showed that reduction of the electric
    field in the InP, due to applied cathode bias, reduced the bias dependant hole avalanche
    and absorber generation contributions to the cathode dark current. Factors of 3.8x
    and 48.2x reduction in dark current resulted for two redesigned cathodes at an operational
    temperature of 200K and +2V cathode bias. This occurred by redesign of the epitaxial
    structure in which the p-doped cap layer was eliminated. However, too much reduction
    of the electric field in the InP may also reduce the escape probability of hot electrons
    in the InP to vacuum thereby reducing quantum efficiency. Therefore a technical
    Phase II objective is to execute a design of experiment (D.O.E) to determine the
    best epitxial design for maximum quantum efficiency and reduced dark current.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
