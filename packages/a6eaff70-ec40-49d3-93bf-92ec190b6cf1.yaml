    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Current and upcoming NASA space links require
    both highly reliable low-rate communications links supporting critical TT&amp;C,
    ranging and voice services and highly efficient High-data rate links supporting
    Mission or Payload Data. Investing in re-usable elements, such as Programmable Communications
    Radios, for ground and flight data handling that are capable of receiving both kinds
    of links would address current Communication and Navigation needs without foregoing
    future capabilities. rnrnAdditionally, the development, test, and optimization of
    new algorithms and modulation schemes require a high-speed platform able to be reconfigured
    as needed. Such a product would feature an open and modular architecture, allowing
    users to independently load and route custom code blocks. A modular and flexible
    High Rate Receiver Backbone (HRRB) would allow customization of some processing
    firmware and should accommodate advances in deployed link formats more easily than
    units "factory loaded" for particular signal types.rnrnSRI's Phase 1 SBIR researched,
    developed an architecture and test bed, and coded and tested an initial set of waveforms
    as a baseline for a Programmable High-rate Multi-mission Receiver. The results of
    this effort showed the technical and commercial viability of such a unit. The proposed
    Phase 2 effort will extend this innovation by developing and implementing an IF
    front end, refining and extending the performance of the ADC/DAC sections and hardware
    architecture, extending the architecture to support programmable and configurable
    decoding processing capacity, testing performance with both extended development
    support modulators/coders as well as other available high-rate modulators, and delivering
    a realized HRRB for further NASA use. Additional market segmentation, analysis,
    and prospect identification would be conducted in preparation for either a Phase
    3 or independent SRI development of a market-ready Programmable High-rate Multi-mission
    Receiver (PHMR).",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
