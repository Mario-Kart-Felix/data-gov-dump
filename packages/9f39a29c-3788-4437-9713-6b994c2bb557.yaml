    (2013) interpreted that two discrete stress orientations are preserved at Neal Hot
    Springs. An older episode of east-west directed extension and a younger episode
    of southwest-northeast directed sinistral, oblique -normal extension. This interpretation
    is consistent with the evolution of Cenozoic tectonics in the region (Edwards, 2013).
    As such we applied a southwest-northeast (060) directed normal faulting stress regime,
    consistent with the younger extensional episode, to the Neal Hot Springs faults.
    nUnder these stress conditions northeast striking steeply dipping fault segments
    have the highest tendency to dilate and northeast striking 60u00b0 dipping fault
    segments have the highest tendency to slip. Under these stress conditions, both
    the Neal Fault and Sugarloaf Butte faults area well-oriented for both slip and dilation
    and thus for fracture permeability. In addition, several subsidiary faults on the

    fault are well oriented for slip and dilation as well.n",ntt"format": "ZIP",ntt"tracking_summary":

    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Slip and Dilation Tendency in focus areasnCritically
    stressed fault segments have a relatively high likelihood of acting as fluid flow
    conduits (Sibson, 1994). As such, the tendency of a fault segment to slip (slip
    tendency; Ts; Morris et al., 1996) or to dilate (dilation tendency; Td; Ferrill
    et al., 1999) provides an indication of which faults or fault segments within a
    geothermal system are critically stressed and therefore likely to transmit geothermal
    fluids. The slip tendency of a surface is defined by the ratio of shear stress to
    normal stress on that surface:nTs = u03c4 / u03c3n t(Morris et al., 1996).nDilation
    tendency is defined by the stress acting normal to a given surface:nTd = (u03c31-u03c3n)
    / (u03c31-u03c33) t(Ferrill et al., 1999). nSlip and dilation were calculated using
    3DStress (Southwest Research Institute).nSlip and dilation tendency are both unitless
    ratios of the resolved stresses applied to the fault plane by ambient stress conditions.
    Values range from a maximum of 1, a fault plane ideally oriented to slip or dilate
    under ambient stress conditions to zero, a fault plane with no potential to slip
    or dilate. Slip and dilation tendency values were calculated for each fault in the
    focus study areas at, McGinness Hills, Neal Hot Springs, Patua, Salt Wells, San
    Emidio, and Tuscarora on fault traces. As dip is not well constrained or unknown
    for many faults mapped in within these we made these calculations using the dip
    for each fault that would yield the maximum slip tendency or dilation tendency.
    As such, these results should be viewed as maximum tendency of each fault to slip
    or dilate. The resulting along-fault and fault-to-fault variation in slip or dilation
    potential is a proxy for along fault and fault-to-fault variation in fluid flow
    conduit potential.nStress Magnitudes and directionsnStress field variation within
    each focus area was approximated based on regional published data and the world
    stress database (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al.,
    2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2010; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes
    2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012; Moeck et al., 2010; Moos and Ronne, 2010 and Reinecker
    et al., 2005) as well as local stress information if applicable. For faults within
    these focus systems we applied either a normal faulting stress regime where the
    vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) which
    is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin) or strike-slip faulting
    stress regime where the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) is larger than the vertical
    stress (sv) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (shmax >sv>shmin)
    depending on the general tectonic province of the system. Based on visual inspection
    of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin we used magnitudes such
    that shmin/shmax = .527 and shmin/sv= .46, which are consistent with complete and
    partial stress field determinations from Desert Peak, Coso, the Fallon area and
    Dixie valley (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al.,
    2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2011; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes
    2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012). nnBased on inversion of fault kinematic data, Edwards
    (2013) interpreted that two discrete stress orientations are preserved at Neal Hot
    Springs. An older episode of east-west directed extension and a younger episode
    of southwest-northeast directed sinistral, oblique -normal extension. This interpretation
    is consistent with the evolution of Cenozoic tectonics in the region (Edwards, 2013).
    As such we applied a southwest-northeast (060) directed normal faulting stress regime,
    consistent with the younger extensional episode, to the Neal Hot Springs faults.
    nUnder these stress conditions northeast striking steeply dipping fault segments
    have the highest tendency to dilate and northeast striking 60u00b0 dipping fault
    segments have the highest tendency to slip. Under these stress conditions, both
    the Neal Fault and Sugarloaf Butte faults area well-oriented for both slip and dilation
    and thus for fracture permeability. In addition, several subsidiary faults on the
    eastern side and within the step-over between the Neal fault and Sugarloaf Butte
    fault are well oriented for slip and dilation as well.n",nt"license_title":
