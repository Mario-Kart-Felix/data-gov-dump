    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    (.txt format). One file provides above- and below-ground biomass, productivity,
    litterfall, and bioelement data for a native C3 grassland near Charleville (-26.40
    S, 146.27 E, Elevation 304 m) in southern Queensland, northeast Australia. The second
    file provides above- and below-ground biomass and productivity estimates for an
    introduced C4 grassland near Charleville. The third file contains climate data (precipitation
    and maximum/minimum temperature) recorded a weather station located at the Charleville
    Airport for the period 1942-1994. The NPP studies were carried out over a 12-month
    period from 1973 to 1974 using harvest techniques with a view to parameterizing
    a simulation model of primary production and livestock carrying capacity. Peak above-ground
    standing crop at the end of the summer season was 122 g/m2 and 154 g/m2 for the
    native and introduced grasslands, respectively. Maximum below-ground standing crop
    was markedly different, at 110 g/m2 and 400 g/m2, respectively, suggesting a significant
    difference in shoot/root allocation. Annual net primary production was estimated
    as the sum of above-ground peak standing crop (live + dead) and root increment.
    These values were 182 and 319 g/m2/yr for the native and introduced grasslands,
    respectively. Additional data on litter production and nutrient dynamics are available
    for the native grassland site. Data on soil moisture, determined gravimetrically
    with each biomass harvest, are available in the literature. ",nt"owner_org":
