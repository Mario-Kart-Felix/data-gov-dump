    backscatter mosaic of the north shore of Buck Island, St. Croix, US Virgin Islands.NOAA's
    NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel, in collaboration
    with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners,
    acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05.
    Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz)
    and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all
    correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower
    low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone
    20 north, datum WGS84. Within CARIS, each line of backscatter data was evaluated
    for bottom tracking and was slant-range corrected. Data was not corrected for gain
    or transmit power artifacts. Backscatter mosaics were then created using the CARIS
    shine-through option. Finally, a georeferenced imagery file was exported from the
    mosaic.While the project was conducted to meet IHO Order 2 accuracy standards, there
    is a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in the dataset that the user should take
    into consideration when performing any analysis.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
