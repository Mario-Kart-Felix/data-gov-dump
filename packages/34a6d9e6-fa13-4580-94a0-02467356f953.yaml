    concentration and stable carbon (13C/12C) and nitrogen (15N/14N) isotope ratios
    of plant (leaves, roots and fungi) and soil samples from southern Africa. The study
    sites in Zambia, Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa are located along the Kalahari
    Transect precipitation gradient. Some of the sites were relatively undisturbed while
    others had different intensities of cultivation, domestic grazing, and fires. The
    data were collected to detect patterns of N cycling along precipitation and grazing
    gradients, including N2 fixation by legumes. Data from different multiple projects
    are included. The plants and soils were sampled mainly in the wet season of years
    1995, 1999, and 2000, with most of the data collected during the SAFARI 2000 Kalahari
    Wet Season Field Campaign in February and March of 2000. Some grass samples were
    collected in the dry season of year 2000 (from Mongu-dambo and Sua Pan grassland
    sites). Soil and plant samples were analyzed in a laboratory for %C, %N, d13C, and
    d15N with an Optima isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled to an elemental analyzer.
    The stable isotope ratios are expressed using standard delta notation in units per
    mil. The isotope ratios are expressed relative to the international standard PDB
    (Pee Dee Belemnite) for carbon and atmospheric N2 for nitrogen samples. The carbon
    and nitrogen contents are expressed in percentage weight of the dry sample.The data
    files contain numerical and character fields of varying length separated by commas
    (.csv format).",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
