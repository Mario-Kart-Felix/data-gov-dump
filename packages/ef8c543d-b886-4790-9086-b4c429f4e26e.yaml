    map of the Drakes Bay and Vicinity map area, California (raster data file is included
    in "SeafloorCharacter_DrakesBay.zip," which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/DrakesBay/data_catalog_DrakesBay.html).
    This raster-format seafloor-character map shows four substrate classes of Drakes
    Bay and Vicinity, California. The substrate classes mapped in this area have been
    further divided into the following California Marine Life Protection Act depth zones
    and slope classes: Depth Zone 2 (intertidal to 30 m), Depth Zone 3 (30 to 100 m),
    Slope Class 1 (0 degrees - 5 degrees), and Slope Class 2 (5 degrees - 30 degrees).
    Depth Zone 1 (intertidal), Depth Zone 4 (100 to 200 m), Depth Zone 5 (greater than
    200 m), and Slopes Classes 3-4 (greater than 30 degrees) are not present in the
    region covered by this block. The map is created using a supervised classification
    method described by Cochrane (2008), available at http://doc.nprb.org/web/research/research%20pubs/615_habitat_mapping_workshop/Individual%20Chapters%20High-Res/Ch13%20Cochrane.pdf.
