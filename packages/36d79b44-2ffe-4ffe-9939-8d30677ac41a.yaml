    are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census
    Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and
    Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed
    for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with
    the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain
    the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas
    may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available
    as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.nnThe
    records in this file allow users to map the parts of the 114th Congressional Districts
    that overlap a particular county.nnCongressional Districts are the 435 areas from
    which people are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.  After the apportionment
    of congressional seats among the States based on census population counts, each
    State is responsible for establishing congressional districts for the purpose of
    electing representatives.  Each congressional district is to be as equal in population
    to all other congressional districts in a State as practicable.  The 114th Congress
    is seated from January 2015 to 2017. The TIGER/Line shapefiles for the District
    of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth
    of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) each contain a single
    record for the non-voting delegate district in these areas.  The boundaries of all
    other congressional districts are provided to the Census Bureau through the Redistricting
    Data Program (RDP).nnThe primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties.
     In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes.  In Alaska, which has no
    counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs,
    municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas.  The latter are delineated
    cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.
     In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more
    incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute
    primary divisions of their states.  These incorporated places are known as independent
    cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation.
     The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is
    considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation.  The Census Bureau
    treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation:
    Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities
    in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin
    Islands.  The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas
    is covered by counties or equivalent entities.  nnThe boundaries for counties and
    equivalent entities are mostly as of January 1, 2013, primarily as reported through
    the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  However, some changes
    made after January 2013, including the addition and deletion of counties, are included.",nt"license_title":
