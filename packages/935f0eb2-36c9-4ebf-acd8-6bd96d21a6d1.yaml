    3 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of the southwest shore of La Parguera,
    Puerto Rico. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA
    vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired
    multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico from 3/21/06
    to 4/2/06. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam
    echosounder (95 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software.
    Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced
    to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS.
    Data is in UTM zone 19 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to
    generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. An ASCII XYZ file was exported
    from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox
    conversion tool 'Feature to Raster' was used to generate the final ESRI Geotiff.The
    project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on
    the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability
    of this data according to their own needs and standards.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
