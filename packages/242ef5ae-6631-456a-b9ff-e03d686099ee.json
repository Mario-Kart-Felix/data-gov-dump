	"notes": "Summary and final report of a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission study to evalaute initial stocking of mountain lion populations in northern Florida-south Georgia, compare performance between wild and captive-raised animals, and determine feasibility of adding new animals to established population. Nineteen mountain lions (Felis concolor stan\/eyana) were released into northern Florida as surrogates for evaluating the feasibility of reintroducing Florida panthers (F. c. coryi) into unoccupied areas of their historic range. These included I I females and 8 vasectomized males. Six of the released mountain lions were born and raised in captivity at Gillman Paper Company's White Oak Plantation near Yulee, Florida, I 0 were captured in the wild in western Texas and translocated to Florida, and 3 were captured in the wild in western Texas and held in captivity in Florida 2-8 years prior to release. Animals were monitored using radio-telemetry at least 3 days\/week from 22 February 1993 to 30 June 1995. Fifteen lions established one or more home ranges. Nine (60%) home ranges overlapped one or more other home ranges. This population was made up of predominately captive-born and wildcaught\/ captive-held animals in an area that varied in size from 127 to 418 km2 ( 1.5 to 3.1 lions\/! 00 km 2 ). Mountain lions that established home ranges outside of this population had a higher excursion rate than did animals within it. Excursions were more frequent during the breeding season than during the rest of the year. Captive-raised animals tended to establish home ranges more quickly and were more likely to be in association with other animals than were wild-caught animals. However, captive-raised animals, particularly males, were more likely to be seen and caused most of the human\/lion interactions that created negative attitudes toward the program. The mean distance from the release site to the home range center and the mean home range size were significantly greater for wild-caught males. Reestablishment of additional Florida panther populations is biologically feasible. It would require incorporating the advantages and planning around the disadvantages of both captive-raised and wild-caught translocated animals. However, complex social issues were identified that must be satisfactorily addressed, and it must be decided whether the tremendous costs involved (economic, political, social, etc.) in the reestablishment of additional Florida panther populations can be offset by the benefits gained in reducing the risk to the present Florida panther population.",
