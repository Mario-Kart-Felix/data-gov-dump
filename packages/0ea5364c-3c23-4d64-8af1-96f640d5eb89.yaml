    bathymetry of a reef shelf/bank and the steep canyons and slopes of the NE Reserve,
    offshore of Fajardo, Puerto Rico. The M-I907-NF-13 survey was split into two sites:
    W00247 in the west and W00246 in the east. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team,
    in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private
    sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the Northeast Grand Reserve
    from 3/05/2013 to 3/29/2013. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Reson 7125 multibeam
    echosounder (400 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software.
    Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced
    to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data
    is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The bathymetry data were geometrically and
    radiometrically corrected using Hypack 2013 acquisition software. The project was
    conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project
    area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data
    according to their own needs and standards.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
