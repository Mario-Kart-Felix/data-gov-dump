    discharge data set by Coe and Olejniczak (1999). The subset was created for the
    study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA)
    in South America (i.e., 10 N to 25 S, 30 to 85 W).The global river discharge data
    set (Coe and Olejniczak 1999), formerly known as the "Climate, People, and Environment
    Program (CPEP) Global River Discharge Database," is a compilation of monthly mean
    discharge data for more than 2600 sites worldwide. The data were compiled from RivDIS
    Version 1.1 (Vorosmarty et al. 1998), the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Brazilian
    National Department of Water and Electrical Energy. The period of record for the
    sites varies from 3 years to greater than 100.The purpose of the global compilation
    is to provide detailed hydrographic information for the climate research community
    in as general a format as possible. Data are given in units of meters cubed per
    second (m**3/sec) and are in ASCII format. Data from stations that had less than
    3 years of information or that had a basin area less than 5000 square kilometers
    were excluded from the global data set. Thus, the data sources may include more
    sites than the data set by Coe and Olejniczak (1999). Users should refer to the
    data originators for further documentation on the source data.More information,
    a map of discharge sites, and a clickable site data table can be found at ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/lba/surf_hydro_and_water_chem/sage/comp/sagedischarge_readme.pdf.LBA
    was a cooperative international research initiative led by Brazil. NASA was a lead
    sponsor for several experiments. LBA was designed to create the new knowledge needed
    to understand the climatological, ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological functioning
    of Amazonia; the impact of land use change on these functions; and the interactions
    between Amazonia and the Earth system. Further information about LBA can be found

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
