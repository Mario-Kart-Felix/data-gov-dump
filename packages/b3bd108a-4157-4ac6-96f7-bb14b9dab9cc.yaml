    to produce forecasts of air-parcel trajectories twice a day at three pressure levels
    over seven sites in Southern Africa for the period August 14, 2000 to September
    23, 2000. These sites are Durban, Middleburg, Pietersburg, and Springbok, South
    Africa; Maun, Botswana; Mongu, Zambia; and Windhoek, Namibia. The twice daily three-dimensional
    wind field (at 0000 and 1200 UTC) was used as input to the trajectory model. By
    integrating the vertical motion of the air parcels over a period of time, the trajectory
    model was able to forecast the net vertical displacement of air parcels during 12-hour
    periods. The resulting trajectory plots represent the three-dimensional transport
    of air in time and can be used to examine what is happening in the low-to-mid troposphere
    during flight and ground-based observations. These levels are most significant in
    terms of the thermodynamic structure of the troposphere, especially the stable layers
    and accumulation of material between and below them, as well containing the major
    levels of subsidence over the subcontinent. The trajectory model output and  thermodynamic
    profiles of the troposphere were used to position aircraft for sampling trace gases,
    aerosols and other species during the SAFARI 2000 field campaign and to predict
    regions of high aerosol and trace gas concentrations downwind.The model output data
    are daily forward and backward trajectory plots at 850 hPa, 700 hPa, and 500 hPa
    pressure levels for each location. The plots are provided as JPEG images with coordinate,
    date, and time stamps.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
