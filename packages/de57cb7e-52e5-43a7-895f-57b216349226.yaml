    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    planning and scheduling challenge as space flight, particularly manned space flight.
    Just on the operational side of it, efforts of thousands of people across hundreds
    of organizations needrnto be coordinated. Numerous tasks of varying complexity and
    nature, from scientific to construction, need to bernaccomplished within limited
    mission time frames. Resources need to be carefully managed and contingencies worked
    out, often on a very short notice. From the beginning of the NASA space program,
    planning has been done by large teams of domain experts workingrnmonths, sometimes
    years, to put together a single mission. This approach, while proven very reliable
    up to now, is becoming increasingly harder to sustain. Elevated levels ofrnNASA
    space activities, from deployment of the new CrewrnExploration Vehicle (CEV) and
    completion of thernInternational Space Station (ISS), to the planned lunarrnmissions
    and permanent lunar bases, will put an evenrngreater strain on this largely manual
    process. While severalrnattempts to automate it have been made in the past, nonernhave
    fully succeeded. In this paper we describe the currentrnNASA planning methods, outline
    their advantages andrndisadvantages, discuss the planning challenges of upcomingrnmissions
    and propose a distributed planning/schedulingrnframework (CMMD) aimed at unifying
    and optimizing thernplanning effort. CMMD will not attempt to make thernprocess
    completely automated, but rather serve in a decisionrnsupport capacity for human
    managers and planners. It willrnhelp manage information gathering, creation of partial
    andrnconsolidated schedules, inter-team negotiations,rncontingencies investigation,
    and rapid re-planning when thernsituation demands it. The first area of CMMD applicationrnwill
    be planning for Extravehicular Activities (EVA) andrnassociated logistics. Other
    potential applications, not onlyrnin the space flight domain, and future research
    efforts willrnbe discussed as well.",nt"owner_org": "d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed",nt"extras":
