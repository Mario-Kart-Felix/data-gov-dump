    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to
    provide absolute radiometric and cross-calibrated spectral characterizations for
    G-LiHT and HyPlant.&amp;nbsp; The objectives are: (i) to provide instrument calibration
    / characterization immediately following the September 2013 flight campaign with
    the two instrument packages, NASA&amp;rsquo;s G-LiHT and ESA&amp;rsquo;s HyPlant;
    (ii) to prototype and evaluate the fusion of the cross-calibrated and co-registered
    G-LiHT/HyPlant data products; and (iii) to offer technical risk reduction to a GSFC
    proposal under development for the NASA Earth Venture Suborbital-2 (EVS-2) program
    and for a ROSES proposal under review by the Terrestrial Ecology (TE) Program.&amp;nbsp;
    The timing for completion of this work is critical for inclusion as a technical
    risk mitigation in the EVS-2 proposal entitled &amp;ldquo;VegFUSION:&amp;nbsp; Assessing
    Plant Functional Diversity &amp;amp; Ecosystem Health&amp;rdquo; due January 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
    NASA /ESA joint campaign was conducted in the United Stated to allow the opportunity
    to bring together two unique airborne instrument packages for vegetation studies
    of carbon cycle dynamics and ecosystem health on the NASA UC-12B KingAir aircraft
    based at LaRC. The two airborne systems are: 1] the European one-of-a-kind high
    spectral resolution HyPlant package (PI, Uwe Rascher, Forschungszentrum J&amp;uuml;lich
    GmbH, J&amp;uuml;lich , Germany) that obtains cutting edge imagery of chlorophyll
    fluorescence emissions from vegetation as well as visible to shortwave infrared
    (VSWIR) reflectance; and 2] The NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center-sponsored G-LiHT
    (Goddard&amp;rsquo;s Lidar, Hyperspectral, and Thermal) package (PI, Bruce Cook,
    NASA/GSFC, Greenbelt, MD, USA) that combines off-the-shelf sensors: two lidars,
    a high resolution visible to near infrared (VNIR) imager, and a thermal imager.
    This preparatory campaign will collect remote sensing airborne data of hyperspectral
    reflectance, fluorescence, thermal imagery, and lidar profiling measurements.&amp;nbsp;
    Along with ground-based data, these aircraft measurements will directly monitor
    the energy budget, actual (as opposed to potential) photosynthesis, stress level
    responses, and canopy structure of two experimental forests with instrumented flux
    towers located in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key component of the success
    of these efforts is the ability to provide data relevant to science investigations,
    in a format that is readily comparable across sensor systems.&amp;nbsp; Accurate
    spectral response characterization of the imaging spectrometers employed here would
    provide the necessary knowledge to maximize use of the ultra-high resolution (&amp;lt;2
    nm) data.&amp;nbsp; Absolute radiometric calibration traceable to a known standard
    would allow the sensor to be compared directly to data from other sensors permitting
    improved understanding of those sensors.&amp;nbsp; One of the original reasons for
    the development of SIRCUS was to characterize hyperspectral sensors to understand
    the stray light inherent to such systems that can hamper the spectral quality of
    the data. Successful implementation of the proposed task will demonstrate Goddard&amp;rsquo;s
    end-to-end capability to supply mission critical calibration/validation in support
    of a NASA HQ sponsored collaboration with the European Space Agency.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
