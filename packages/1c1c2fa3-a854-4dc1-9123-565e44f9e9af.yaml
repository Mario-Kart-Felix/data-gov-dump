    product 'OMAERUV', recently re-processed using an enhanced algorithm, is now released
    (April 2012) to the public. The data is available from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences
    Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC), http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/omaeruv_v003.shtml
    NASA Aura satellite sensors are tracking important atmospheric pollutants from space
    since its launch in July, 2004. The Ozone Monitoring Instrument(OMI), one of the
    four Aura satellite sensors with its 2600 km viewing swath width provides daily
    global measurements of four important US Environmental Protection Agency criteria
    pollutants (Tropospheric ozone, Nitrogen dioxide,Sulfur dioxide and Aerosols from
    biomass burning and industrial emissions, HCHO, BrO, OClO and surface UV irradiance.
    OMI is a contribution of the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programs (NIVR)in
    collaboration with Finish Meterological Institute (FMI), to the US EOS-Aura Mission.
    The principal investigator (Dr. Pieternel Levelt) institute is the KNMI (Royal Netherlands
    Meteorological Institute). The Level-2 OMI Aerosol Product OMAERUV from the Aura-OMI
    is now available from NASAs GSFC Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services
    Center (DISC) for public access. OMAERUV retrieval algorithm is developed by the
    US OMI Team Scientists. Dr. Omar Torres (GSFC/NASA) is the principal investigator
    of this product. The OMAERUV product contains Aerosol Absorption and Aerosol Extinction
    Optical Depths, and Single Scattering Albedo at three different wavelengths (354,
    388 and 500 nm), Aerosol Index, and other ancillary and geolocation parameters,
    in the OMI field of view (13x24 km). Another standard OMI aerosol product is OMAERO,
    that is based on the KNMI multi-wavelength spectral fitting algorithm. OMAERUV files
    are stored in EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each file contains data from
    the day lit portion of an orbit (~53 minutes). There are approximately 14 orbits
    per day. The maximum file size for the OMAERUV data product is about 6 Mbytes. A
    list of tools for browsing and extracting data from these files can be found at:
    http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/tools.shtml A short OMAERUV Readme Document that
    includes brief algorithm description and currently known data quality issues is
    provided by the OMAERUV Algorithm lead (see http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/OMI/omaeruv_v003.shtml)
    For more information on Ozone Monitoring Instrument and atmospheric data products,
    please visit the OMI-Aura sites: http://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/ http://www.knmi.nl/omi/research/documents/
    . OMAERUV Data Groups and Parameters: The OMAERUV data file contains a swath which
    consists of two groups: Data fields: Total Aerosol Optical Depth (extinction optical
    depth) and Aerosol Absorption Optical Depths (at 354, 388 and 500 nm), Single Scattering
    Albedo, UV Aerosol Index, Visible Aerosol Index, and other intermediate and ancillary
    parameters (e.g. Estimates of Aerosol Total Extinction and Absorption Optical Depths
    and Single Scattering Albedo at five atmospheric levels, Aerosol Type, Aerosol Layer
    Height, Normalized Radiance, Lambert equivalent Reflectivity, Surface Albedo, Imaginary
    Component of Refractive Index) and Data Quality Flags. Geolocation Fields: Latitude,
    Longitude, Time(TAI93), Seconds, Solar Zenith Angles, Viewing Zenith Angles, Relative
    Azimuth Angle, Terrain Pressure, Ground Pixel Quality Flags. For the full set of
    Aura products available from the GES DISC, please see the link below. http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
