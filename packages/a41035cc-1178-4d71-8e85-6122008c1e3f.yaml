    and many adjoining tributaries was determined as part of a bioeffects assessments
    program managed by NOAA's National Status and Trends Program. Biscayne Bay was selected
    by NOAA for this survey because data from the NS&T Mussel Watch Program and data
    from previous surveys of the bay had shown a potential for toxicity and other adverse
    biological effects. In addition, no bay-wide information had been generated on the
    toxicological condition of the bay sediments and several agencies had indicated
    a need for this type of data and a willingness to assist NOAA in collecting them.
    The study area was defined as extending from Dumbfoundling Bay at the north end
    to Little Card Sound at the south end, seaward to the barrier islands or reef, and
    landward to the shoreline or saltwater control structures. This area was determined
    to encompass a total of 484 kilometers of the sea floor. During 1995 and 1996, 226
    samples were collected from randomly-chosen locations and tested for toxicity and
    analyzed for chemical concentrations. Data from these tests and analyses are included
    in the report. Samples for benthic community analyses were collected at one-third
    of the stations; however, data from those analyses are not included in the report
    but are available from NOAA's online database http://nbi.noaa.gov/mapBiscaynebay.aspx.The
    survey was designed to characterize sediment quality throughout the greater Biscayne
    Bay area. Surficial sediment samples were collected during 1995 and 1996 from 226
    randomly-chosen locations throughout nine major regions. Laboratory toxicity tests
    were performed as indicators of potential ecotoxicological effects in sediments.
    A battery of tests was performed to generate information from different phases (components)
    of the sediments. Tests were selected to represent a range in toxicological endpoints
    from acute to chronic sublethal responses. Toxicological tests were conducted to
    measure: reduced survival of adult amphipods exposed to solid-phase sediments; impaired
    fertilization success and abnormal morphological development in gametes and embryos,
    respectively, of sea urchins exposed to pore waters; reduced metabolic activity
    of a marine bioluminescent bacteria exposed to organic solvent extracts; induction
    of a cytochrome P-450 reporter gene system in exposures to solvent extracts; and
    reduced reproductive success in marine copepods exposed to solid-phase sediments.The
