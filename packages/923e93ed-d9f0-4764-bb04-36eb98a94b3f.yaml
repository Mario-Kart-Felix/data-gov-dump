    mission critical systems require a comprehensive methodology for proactively detecting
    and isolating failures, recommending and guiding condition-based maintenance actions,
    and estimating in real time the remaining useful life of critical components and
    associated subsystems.rnrnA major challenge has been to extend the benefits of prognostics
    to include computer servers and other electronic components. The key enabler for
    prognostics capabilities is monitoring time series signals relating to the health
    of executing components and subsystems. Time series signals are processed in real
    time using pattern recognition for proactive anomaly detection and for remaining
    useful life estimation. Examples will be presented of the use of pattern recognition
    techniques for early detection of a number of mechanisms that are known to cause
    failures in electronic systems, including: environmental issues; software aging;
    degraded or failed sensors; degradation of hardware components; degradation of mechanical,
    electronic, and optical interconnects. Prognostics pattern classification is helping
    to substantially increase component reliability margins and system availability
    goals while reducing costly sources of "no trouble found"rnrnevents that have
    become a significant warranty-cost issue.rnrn rnrn**Bios**rnrnAleksey Urmanov is
    a research scientist at Sun Microsystems. He earned his doctoral degree in Nuclear
    Engineering at the University of Tennessee in 2002. Dr. Urmanov's research activities
    are centered around his interest in pattern recognition, statistical learning theory
    and ill-posed problems in engineering. His most recent activities at Sun focus on
    developing health monitoring and prognostics methods for EP-enabled computer servers.

    University. Before joining Sun Microsystems Inc. in 2007, he was a lecturer in Nuclear
    Engineering Department and a member of Applied Intelligent Systems Laboratory (AISL),
    of Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA. Dr. Bougaev is a founder and the Editor-in-Chief
    of the Journal of Pattern Recognition Research. His current focus is in reliability
    physics with emphasis on complex system analysis and the physics of failures which
    are based on the data driven pattern recognition techniques. ",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
