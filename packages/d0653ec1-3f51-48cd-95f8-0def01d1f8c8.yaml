    uses laser light to detect, range, or identify remote objects based on light reflected
    by the object or emitted through it subsequent fluorescence. Airborne ranging lidar
    is now being applied in coastal environments to produce accurate, cost-efficient
    elevation datasets with high data density. The USGS in cooperation with NASA and
    NPS is using airborne lidar to measure the submerged topography of the north Florida
    reef tract; secondarily, the data will be assessed for its potential in terms of
    benthic characterization. Elevation measurements were collected over Biscayne National
    Park using the NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL), a pulsed
    laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure subaerial and submarine
    coastal topography. With the NASA EAARL lidar system, submarine data is generally
    acquired to a maximum of approximately 1.5 secchi depths (a measure of water clarity).
    The system uses a high frequency laser beam directed at the earth's surface through
    an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the
    time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected
    laser signal in the aircraft. The Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar,
    developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Wallops Flight
    Facility (WFF) in Virginia, measures ground elevation with a vertical resolution
    of roughly 15 centimeters. A sampling rate of up to 3 kHz results in an extremely
    dense spatial elevation data set. The EAARL system is typically flown at 300 m altitude
    AGL, resulting in a 240 m swath for each flightline. Data collection occurred with
    approximately 50% overlap between flightlines, resulting in about one laser sounding
    per square meter. The data were processed by the USGS Center for Coastal and Watershed
    Studies to produce 1u8db3meter resolution raster images that can be easily ingested
    into a Geographic Information System (GIS). The data were organized as 2 km by 2
    km data tiles in 32u8db3bit floatingu8db3point integer GeoTiff format. For more
    information on Lidar science and the Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar
    (EAARL) system and surveys, see http://ngom.usgs.gov/dsp/overview/index.php and
