    in constructing physics of failure models for electrolytic capacitors subjected
    to electrical stressors in DC-DC power converters. Electrolytic capacitors and MOSFETu2019s
    are known to be the primary causes for degradation and failure in DC-DC converter
    systems. We have employed a topological energy based modeling scheme based on the
    bond graph (BG) modeling language for building parametric models of multi-domain
    systems, such as motors and pumps. In previous work, we have conducted experimental
    studies to validate an empirical physics of failure model based on Arrhenius Law
    for equivalent series resistance (ESR) increase in electrolytic capacitors operating
    under nominal conditions. In this paper, our focus shifts to deriving first principle
    models of capacitor degradation that explain both the ESR increase and the decrease
    in capacitance over time when the capacitor is operated under electrical stress
    conditions. Experimental studies are run in parallel, and data collected from these
    studies are used to validate the generated models. In the future, they will also
    be used to compute model parameters, so that the overall goal of deriving accurate
    models of capacitor degradation, and using them to predict performance changes in
    DC-DC converters is realized.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
