    backscatter mosaic of Grammanik Bank, south of St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands.NOAA's
    NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster
    and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry
    data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted
    Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor
    using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound
    velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved
    tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The backscatter
    component of the bathymetry data were processed by the Hawaii Mapping Research Group
    (HMRG), University of Hawaii using the HAWAII MR1 Sidescan Sonar Software Suite.
    The data were corrected for angle varying gain, transmit power and pulse width.
    Electronic and acoustic noise, such as striping due to across track variations in
    amplitude and speckling due to transducer motion, were removed.The project was conducted
    to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and
    depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according
    to their own needs and standards.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
