    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    text format (.txt). One file contains estimates of above-ground live phytomass for
    an ephemeral desert steppe located in the Badkhyz Nature Reserve in southern Turkmenistan.
    Monthly measurements of plant biomass were made by harvest during the growing season
    (January-May) from 1948 through 1963. Afterwards, an annual measurement of peak
    live biomass was made in May from 1964 through 1982, with gaps for years 1973-1976.
    The second file contains monthly and annual climate data recorded at the study site
    from 1941 through 1982. Above-ground net production (ANPP) for the Badkhyz site
    is the lowest among the eight Eurasian grassland sites, at 100 g/m2/yr. Below-ground
    NPP for Badkhyz (1,745 g/m2/yr) was conservatively estimated from a similar dry,
    semiarid continental steppe in Northern Kazakhstan (i.e., Shortandy). Revision Notes:
    Only the documentation for this data set has been modified. The data files have
    been checked for accuracy and are identical to those originally published in 1998.
