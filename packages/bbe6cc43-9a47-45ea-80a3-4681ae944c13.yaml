    backscatter mosaic of selected portions of seafloor around Tourmaline Bank, Puerto
    Rico. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel
    Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam
    bathymetry data in Puerto Rico from 2/25/08 to 3/8/08. Data was acquired with a
    hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) in 2008. It
    was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors
    applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water
    (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone
    19 north, datum NAD83. The backscatter component of the bathymetry data was geometrically
    and radiometrically corrected using Geocoder 3.2.1 software. Acoustic backscatter
    mosaics are an important piece of information when characterizing surficial seafloor
    features and delineating benthic habitats. The project was conducted to meet IHO
    Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependent on the project area and depth. All users
    should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own
    needs and standards.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
