  induced contaminants on fish, wildlife, and human health near Stillwater Wildlife
  Management Area. In 1988, the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
  Service initiated detailed investigations of the extent of irrigation induced contaminants
  affecting fish, wildlife, and human health in and near Stillwater Wildlife Management
  Area, in the Carson River drainage basin in west central Nevada. Study objectives
  included the determination of the extent of trace element contamination and wetland
  deterioration, the definition of contaminant pathways, and the identification of
  contaminant source areas, in preparation for remediation.  Approximately 10 percent
  of historic wetlands at the terminus of the Carson River remain and the quality
  of water now reaching the wetland has been degraded. Concentrations of dissolved
  solids in marsh inflow water is approximately 5 times greater than is believed to
  have existed prior to agricultural diversion and water consumption beginning in
  the late 1800's. Degraded water quality has contributed to decreases in the abundance
  and diversity of wetland vegetation, fish, and wetland dependent wildlife.  Acute
  toxicity was shown in water of some agricultural drains and wetlands through bioassays
  using fish and invertebrates. Toxicity was attributed to a combination of arsenic,
  boron, lithium, and molybdenum. Rapidly fluctuating levels of dissolved solid and
  ionic composition may also be contributing to additional stress to aquatic organisms.
  \ Evidence suggests that mercury and selenium are bioaccumulated and biomagnified.
  Selenium, mobilized by agricultural activities, is transported to wetlands within
  organic material through the agricultural drains, particularly during peak discharge
  events. The selenium hazard to migratory birds was greatest in wetlands receiving
  plant and invertebrate drift directly from drains. However, evidence linking migratory
  birds mortality in the study area to selenosis was not found, and selenium concentrations
  in wetland biota were not cumulative in response to decades of irrigation drainage.
  High levels of mercury, introduced in the late 1800's by mining activities, were
  found at sites associated with the historic floodways of the Carson River. Mercury
  continues to bioaccumulate in organisms from these previously contaminated areas.
  \ Although waterfowl production was reduced in the study area, contaminants did
  not appear to effect hatching success. Concentrations of potentially toxic trace
  elements found in waterfowl eggs were below those reported to adversely affect development
  or hatching. Likewise, no evidence of teratogenesis in migratory bird embryos or
  juveniles was found. Poor waterfowl production was attributed to extended drought
  conditions, absence of water, sparse nesting vegetation, and predation.  Mercury
  and selenium levels in tissues of adult waterfowl harvested in the study area were
  sufficient to warrant human health concerns. Levels varied among waterfowl species
  with highest levels found in shoveler ducks, where mercury levels were great enough
  to warrant a Nevada State Health Advisory for the consumption of shovelers taken
  at Carson Lake. Evidence was found that waterfowl are accumulating mercury and selenium
  within the wetlands.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"4d7ad1cd-3641-420b-8116-e4082f49cd44\",\n\t\"extras\":
