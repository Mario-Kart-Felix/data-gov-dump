    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Nearly all mechanism applications require
    some form of gearbox.  Wet lubricated gearbox technologies are limited to the relatively
    narrow temperature ranges of their lubricants.rnrnDry lubricated gearboxes have
    proven to be problematic with poor life and reliability characteristics.  Testing
    has shown that dry lubricated rolling elements can be made to work reliably provided
    they are operated at conservative contact stresses, however when dry film lubrications
    are tested under the sliding conditions in conventional transmissions they are no
    longer reliable. rnrnDuring the Phase I SBIR Rocketstar Robotics developed the preliminary
    design of a transmission that consists of all rolling elements and has eliminated
    all of the sliding elements that exist in conventional gearing.  The transmission
    operates at contact stress values that are conservative and within the envelope
    proven through previous testing to provide reliable performance in rolling elements.
     The resulting transmission can be provided in a range of sizes and offers considerable
    torque capability within a reasonable envelope while operating within conservative
    rolling contact stress regimes at operating temperatures from near absolute zero
    to over 500C.rnrnThe development and test of a successful prototype could revolutionize
    the torque transmission industry and open the door to mechanisms operations over
    a much broader temperature range than is now possible.   Rocketstar Robotics proposes
    that the design be carried through the detailed design phase which includes detailed
    analysis models and that multiple prototypes be built of two different size transmissions.
     The units would then be tested for performance and life over the extremes of temperature
    from near cryogenic to 500C operation.rnrnRocketstar will build 3 small 100 in-lb
    units and 3 large 400 in-lb units for testing along with spare splines to allow
    development testing with multiple DFL types.  One of each unit will be delivered
    to NASA.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
