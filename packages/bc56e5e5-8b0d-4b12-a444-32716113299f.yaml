  and essential component of USVI coral reef ecosystems. Yet despite their importance,
  striking population and community level changes have occurred in the recent past
  due to fishing pressure and habitat degradation. The monitoring methodologies described
  in this document are necessary for understanding how natural and anthropogenic stressors
  are changing reef fish populations and communities and will be critical for their
  sustainable management. A collaborative research effort between the NOAAu0092s National
  Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessmentu0092s
  Biogeography Branch (BB) and the National Park Service (NPS) has been used to inventory
  and assess reef fish populations in reef and reef-associated habitats in the northeast
  region of St. Croix from 2001-2011. The survey method previously used has been refined
  to enable broader region-wide coverage at the scale of the USVI yet maintains high
  precision at the Marine Protected Area (MPA) spatial level. Region-wide population
  metric estimates are required to effectively manage reef fisheries but are also
  imperative for spatial management and understanding ecosystem-level processes. For
  example, the ability to place protected fish resources in the context of the greater
  region not only allows for the evaluation of management actions but it also provides
  the ability to determine the ecological role of an MPA in the greater ecosystem.
  The monitoring method previously used by the Biogeography Branch and other partners
  in St. Croix and other regions within the USVI and Puerto Rico will be used to characterize
  and establish baseline data for future monitoring. St. Croix was chosen to serve
  as the first area to implement the protocol and to evaluate the logistics necessary
  to implement a long term monitoring program. Characterization and monitoring of
  fish communities requires a quantitative measure of the spatial distribution and
  variation of those communities. These measures will enable managers to make targeted
  management decisions (e.g. where to allow mooring or where to allow recreational
  activities such as snorkeling and SCUBA diving). Additionally, the spatial setting,
  both within and outside protected regions allows managers to assess the impact,
  if any, of a change in regulation such as the prohibition of fishing. It also enables
  analysis of any differential effect (i.e. the effect may be the same throughout
  the region or it may be more effective toward an edge or center of a management
  area). To quantify patterns of spatial distribution and make meaningful interpretations,
  we must first have knowledge of the underlying variables determining species distribution.
  The basis for this work therefore, is the nearshore benthic habitats maps (less
  than 100 ft depth) created by NOAA's Biogeography Program in 2001 and NOS' bathymetry
  models. The sampling domain includes all hardbottom habitats around St. Croix at
  depths less than 30m. The benthic habitat map and a habitat classification scheme
  were used to create a sample frame constructed with 50 x 50 m grids. Grids were
  stratified based on three variables: Hardbottom habitat type, depth zone, and region/management
  area. Habitat within these grids was stratified into 5 habitat categories (scattered
  coral/ rock, pavement, bedrock, patch reef and linear reef) each with two depth
  classifications (shallow (0-11.9 m) and deep (12- 30m)). Further stratification
  was assigned based on management zones and region of the island. There are three
  managed areas in St. Croix. Two federal marine protected areas are managed by the
  Department of Interioru0092s National Park Service: Buck Island Reef National Monument
  and Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Reserve. The St. Croix
  East End Marine Park is a territorial marine protected area managed by the USVI
  Department of Planning and Natural Resources. Other strata include specific regions
  of St. Croix: North, East, West, and South shores. Overall there were 70 possible
  strata: 5 habitat types, 2 depth zones and 8 management areas/regions. The monitoring
  objectives of this protocol are to determine status, trends, and variability in
  exploited reef fish species and communities within the USVI region and inside vs.
  outside different management zones, using measures such as relative abundance (density),
  spatial distribution, size structure and diversity. The survey design is optimized
  for nine economically and ecologically important species in the USVI: blue tang
  (Acanthurus coeruleus). queen triggerfish (Balistes vetula), coney (Cephalopholis
  fulva), red hind (Epinephelus guttatus), foureye butterflyfish (Chaetodon capistratus),
  French grunt (Haemulon flavolineatum), yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus), stoplight
  parrotfish (Sparisoma viride) and threespot damselfish (Stegastes planifrons). These
  species were chosen to include a broad range of life history traits as well as a
  variety of habitat utilization patterns. The sample design is optimized with the
  respect to these species, but because all fish species are recorded, monitoring
  efforts also obtain important information about many non-targeted species, the overall
  trophic structure, and form the scientific basis for effective management actions.
  As such, the sample allocation for this mission is based upon the existing community
  metrics and the above species specific distribution from the northeast region of
  St. Croix. It was determined that 250 samples among the various strata would be
  sufficient to characterize hard bottom habitats around the island and have comparable
  coefficient of variation (CV) to values observed in the northeast region of St.
  Croix. The goal was to survey as many of the 250 sites as possible in a two week
  time period. We organized a strong science field team and completed 286 fish and
  benthic surveys around the island.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\":
