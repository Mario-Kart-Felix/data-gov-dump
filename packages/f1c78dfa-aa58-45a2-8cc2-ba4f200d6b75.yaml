  (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from
  the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
  Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless
  national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File
  is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to
  cover the entire nation. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides
  by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or
  by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short
  line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small
  in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks
  in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles
  in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used
  geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census
  geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with
  roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010
  Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census
  Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to
  the appropriate geographic areas. Census blocks cover all territory in the United
  States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth
  of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Blocks are the smallest
  geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census.
  A block may consist of one or more faces. This table contains housing data derived
  from the U.S. Census 2010 Summary file 1 database for blocks. The 2010 Summary File
  1 (SF 1) contains data compiled from the 2010 Decennial Census questions. This table
  contains data on housing units, owner and rental. This table contains population
  data derived from the U.S. Census 2010 Summary file 1 database for blocks. The 2010
  Summary File 1 (SF 1) contains data compiled from the 2010 Decennial Census questions.
  This table contains demographic population data including ancestry groups, age,
  and sex.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\": \"bbox-east-long\",\n\t\t\"value\":
