    open grantmaking information on the applicants received, grantees awarded and project
    locations. The purpose of Promise Neighborhoods is to improve significantly the
    educational and developmental outcomes of children in our most distressed communities,
    and to transform those communities by-- (1) Supporting efforts to improve child
    outcomes and ensure that data on those outcomes are communicated and analyzed on
    an ongoing basis by leaders and members of the community; (2) Identifying and increasing
    the capacity of eligible entities that are focused on achieving results and building
    a college-going culture in the neighborhood; (3) Building a complete continuum of
    cradle-through-college-to-career solutions (continuum of solutions), which has both
    academic programs and family and community supports, with a strong school or schools
    at the center. Academic programs must include (a) High-quality early learning programs
    designed to improve outcomes in multiple domains of early learning; (b) programs,
    policies, and personnel for children in kindergarten through the 12th grade that
    are linked to improved academic outcomes; and (c) programs that prepare students
    for college and career success. Family and community supports must include programs
    to improve student health, safety, community stability, family and community engagement,
    and student access to 21st century learning tools. The continuum of solutions also
    must be linked and integrated seamlessly so there are common outcomes, a focus on
    similar milestones, support during transitional time periods, and no time or resource
    gaps that create obstacles for students in making academic progress. The continuum
    also must be based on the best available evidence including, where available, strong
    or moderate evidence, and include programs, policies, practices, services, systems,
    and supports that result in improving educational and developmental outcomes for
    children from cradle through college to career; (4) Integrating programs and breaking
    down agency "silos" so that solutions are implemented effectively and efficiently
    across agencies; (5) Supporting the efforts of eligible entities, working with local
    governments, to build the infrastructure of policies, practices, systems, and resources
    needed to sustain and "scale up" proven, effective solutions across the broader
    region beyond the initial neighborhood; and (6) Learning about the overall impact
    of Promise Neighborhoods and about the relationship between particular strategies
    in Promise Neighborhoods and student outcomes, including a rigorous evaluation of
    the program.",nt"license_title": "Creative Commons CCZero",nt"extras":
