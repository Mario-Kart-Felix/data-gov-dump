    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The need for higher performance fiber optic
    telecommunications receivers has provided the impetus for substantial progress during
    the last decade in the understanding and performance of InP-based linear mode avalanche
    photodiodes (APDs) for the wavelength range from 1.0 to 1.7 um.  However, these
    advances have not been paralleled in the performance and availability of single
    photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) based on similar design and materials platforms.
     Moreover, the vast majority of the activity in this field has been focused on
    optimizing devices for telecommunications wavelengths in the vicinity of 1550 nm,
    and there has been very little work on devices for use at 1064 nm.  For this SBIR
    program, we propose to apply innovative design concepts for the development of high
    performance SPADs optimized for 1064 nm applications.  In particular, we will implement
    a novel bandgap engineering approach to tailor the SPAD avalanche gain properties
    to realize higher single photon detection efficiency while maintaining the very
    low dark count rates that are made possible by optimizing the absorption region
    design for the detection of 1064 nm photons.  We will also apply design concepts
    that we have innovated during the course of developing state-of-the-art 1550 nm
    SPADs that involve optimization of the device electric profile for photon counting
    as well as epitaxial layer compositions.  These efforts will culminate in 1064 nm
    large area detectors (with active area diameters up to 500 um) that demonstrate
    feasibility in meeting SPAD performance targets including 50&#37; detection efficiency,
    bandwidth of 500 MHz, saturation levels of 50 Mcounts/s, and non-gated operation.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
