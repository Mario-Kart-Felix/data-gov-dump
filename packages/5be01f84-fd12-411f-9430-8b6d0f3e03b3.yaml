    the feasibility of developing a technology that will reduce cost and manufacturing
    time, broaden design options, and improve performance of large space optics.  rnPrimarily
    addressed is light weighting ULE glass mirrors for large telescope systems.  rnrnWhile
    milling and cutting materials such as ULE or SiC is often performed at Ormond using
    a novel abrasivejet technology, there is a need to develop this technology to a
    the requirements of large optics manufacturing.rnIn Phase I, Ormond proprietary
    glass and ceramic cutting and milling technologies were adapted to AMTD-2 requirements
    through software, process and tool development.  The technology is now at TRL5 and
    technology feasibility has been demonstrated.  rnrnA demonstration coupon was machined
    based on the current AMTD mirror concept at rates several times faster than conventional
    grinding can accomplish.  This design has 0.75 inch deep hex cell pockets in the
    mirror back, the same as would exist on a full scale mirror.  Rough semi-elliptical
    optical surface machining was also demonstrated in Schott glass.  Tooling designed
    in the Phase II program will support substantial improvements in risk mitigation,
    tolerance holding capability and material removal rates.rnrnThis work will continue
    to be performed with close interaction with NASA and Exelis to insure that the work
    directly supports current and future program needs.  The Phase II program will result
    in a working system that is capable of completing a 1/3 scale model of the AMTD-2
    mirror with tremendous cost savings, schedule reduction and risk reduction compared
    to grinding.  Capacity for full scale up will be demonstrated during Phase II.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
