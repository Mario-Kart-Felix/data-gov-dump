  maps derived from the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)-Polar
  Orbiting Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) have been available since
  1981. The multichannel sea surface temperature algorithm (MCSST) has been used to
  routinely calculate SSTs using a split window approach. Currently this algorithm
  is applied by the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) to calculate SSTs at a
  near real-time rate.    The multichannel sea surface temperature algorithm uses
  a set of linear coefficients to retrive sea surface temperature from the brightness
  radiances. Improved cloud retrieval algorithms applied by NAVOCEANO have significantly
  increased the number of SST pixels flagged as cloud free, as compared to previous
  MCSST data sets. The NAVOCEANO MCSST data sets provide a high quality near real
  time sea surface temperature data set with a high number of cloud free retrievals.
  Additionally the orbital temporal and 9km spatial resolutions allow this data to
  be used in a quasi real time mode for detection of mesoscale features such as eddies
  associated with major current systems. The history of SST computation from AVHRR
  radiances is discussed at length by- -McClain et al., 1985--. Briefly, radiative
  transfer theory is used to correct for the effects of the atmosphere on the observations
  by utilizing \"windows\" of the electromagnetic spectrum where little or no atmospheric
  absorption occurs. Channel radiances are transformed (through the use of the Planck
  function) to units of temperature, then compared to a-priori temperatures measured
  at the surface. This comparison yields coefficients which, when applied to the global
  AVHRR data, give estimates of surface temperature which have been nominally accurate
  to 0.7 degrees Celsius. Each AVHRR scan views Earth for 51.282 milliseconds, during
  which time each channel of the analog data output is digitized. Scans occur at the
  rate of 6 per second, and the sampling rate of the AVHRR sensors is 39,936 samples
  per second per channel. During a scan, the detectors view an internal target, cold
  space, and the external scene. The temperature of the internal target is monitored,
  and space is assumed to have a black- body temperature of 3K. In this way, a simple
  two-point linear calibration is done internally (Schwalb, 1978). The nonlinear modification
  to this calibration is achieved at the time of postprocessing, and takes into account
  sensor nonlinearities, measurement of internal target temperature, calculation of
  target radiance, internal reflections and emissions, etc. Sensor/Instrument Measurement
  Geometry:The AVHRR has a cross-track scanning system which use an elliptical beryllium
  mirror rotating at 360 RPM about an axis parallel to the Earth. The 110.8 degree
  cross-track scan equates to a swath width of about 2700 km. This swath width is
  greater than the 25.3 degree separation between successive orbital tracks, and provides
  overlapping coverage. Coverage is global, twice daily, at an instantaneous field
  of view (IFOV) of ~1.4 milliradians, giving a ground field of view of ~1.1 km at
  nadir for a nominal altitude of 833 km. Full resolution AVHRR data are continuously
  transmitted and recorded in High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) format.
  The Global Area Coverage (GAC) data are subsampled to approximately 4 km IFOV, recorded
  internally, and downlinked daily. The MCSST coefficients are then applied to the
  infrared brightness radiances to convert to SST. A level 2 declouded product produced
  by the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) is then downloaded to JPL for distribution.
  The level-2 product is available in orbital files with a spatial resolution of approximately
  9 kilometers. There are approximately 28 files per day for the NOAA-14 and NOAA-16
  data. The spatial coverage is not uniform because of cloud coverage, which prevents
  the AVHRR instrument from seeing the ocean. Data Organization: Granularity: (http://harp.gsf\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
