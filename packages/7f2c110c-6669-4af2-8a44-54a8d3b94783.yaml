    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    field measurements of woody vegetation (shrubs) at 26 diverse sites across the North
    Slope of Alaska during 2010 and 2011, (2) field-based statistical estimates of site
    shrub structural characteristics, (3) high-resolution panchromatic satellite imagery-based
    estimates of the field site shrub characteristics using the Canopy Analysis with
    Panchromatic Imagery (CANAPI) model, and (4) adjusted CANAPI estimates of shrub
    characteristics at 1,013 selected sites widely distributed across the North Slope.
    A site characterization file is included with the assigned u201cPhysiognomic vegetation
    classu201d, which was one of the criteria for the selection of the 1013 CANAPI sites,
    and with the sources of the high resolution imagery used to obtain CANAPI estimates.
    The CANAPI crown detection algorithm (Chopping, 2011) is also provided as a companion
    file.As part of a NASA-funded research project to map changes in tall shrub (taller
    than 0.5 m) abundance in Arctic tundra, a 3-week field campaign was carried out
    in 2010 and 2011 on the North Slope of Alaska to statistically survey shrub structural
    characteristics at 26 sites. The field data presented include genus, crown height,
    crown radius, and spatial coordinates of all shrubs sampled at each 250 x 250-m
    site. These measurements were correlated with raw CANAPI structural estimates and
    the derived regression coefficients were applied to adjust CANAPI estimates for
    the field sites and additional sites across the North Slope.",nt"owner_org":
