    of Fajardo and Luqillo to the Former Roosevelt Roads Navy Base, the Vieques Sound,
    La Cordillera Reserve, the Luis Pena Reserve, and the waters around Culebra Island.
    The GV data contains GPS-positioned underwater photo/videos of selected benthic
    habitats that were used to enhance thematic maps created by the Biogeography Team.
    The observations from the videos are used to classify seafloor features and develop
    a benthic habitat map. The GV data was collected in July 8 - 24, 2013 and October
    22- November 7, 2013. The field work was conducted by NOAA together with local DRNA
