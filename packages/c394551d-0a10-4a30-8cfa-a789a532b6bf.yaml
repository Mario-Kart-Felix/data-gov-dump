    thermoelectric materials for use in fabricating solid state cooling devices and
    electrical power generators, which are 200 to 300&#37; more efficient than current
    thermoelectric materials and can operate in temperatures ranging from cryogenic
    to 700 C.  The results of our Phase I definitely indicate that we will be able to
    reach this goal.  These materials are being made from new nano-composites, using
    fabrication techniques developed at Eltron. rnrnThe thermoelectric composite's matrix
    had already demonstrated exceptional ability for functioning in the environment
    of space.  Used in a cooling system, these materials will provide an effective means
    for controlling the temperature of surfaces subject to the rapidly changing temperatures
    encountered in space.  We have proven that this matrix works exceptionally well
    at providing support and allowing for convenient (and therefore economical) deposition
    of our materials.  We have also demonstrated that the thermal conductivity in these
    new nano-materials has been reduced by well over an order of magnitude!  In addition
    we have shown that we get an increase in the Seebeck Coefficient for materials we
    tested as well.  These new thermoelectric materials can be used to prevent development
    of large temperature gradients and thereby prevent the mechanical stresses that
    accompany them.  Used for power-generation, these new materials will be very efficient
    because of the properties that both the nano-phase materials and its matrix bring
    to the thermoelectric material.  Because of the difficulties presented in the harsh
    environment of space, thermal management and power generation is most easily provided
    through devices that do not have any moving parts, are very durable, do not require
    maintenance, and operate efficiently over a wide range of temperatures.  The proposed
    materials meet all these requirements.rn",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
