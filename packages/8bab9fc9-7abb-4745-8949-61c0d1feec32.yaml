    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;Advancements in radar technology
    have resulted in commercial, automotive collision avoidance radars. These radar
    systems typically use 37GHz or 77GHz &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;interferometry&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    to identify hazards around a vehicle. This is done by developing a high-resolution
    &amp;lsquo;topographic&amp;rsquo; map of the area surrounding the vehicle and identifying
    potential changes in the surrounding area. &amp;nbsp;The technology should not be
    confused with older radar systems, which do not use interferometry. Automotive interferometric
    systems are designed to be lightweight, consume little electric power, and are small
    enough to fit into fenders of vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These systems have enormous
    potential in performing the same functions for planetary landers.&amp;nbsp; Compared
    to systems dependent on optical wavelengths, suspended dust, small particles and
    aerosols are transparent to radar&amp;rsquo;s much longer wavelengths. &amp;nbsp;The
    automotive collision avoidance systems are not inhibited by dust clouds as are optical
    systems, are relatively small, and do not consume much power &amp;ndash; three key
    characteristics that make them good candidates for a collision avoidance system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radar
    systems, from vendors like Delphi Automotive, are available with the full complement
    of hardware, processing software and visualization systems. We emphasize the importance
    of the existing software base.&amp;nbsp; Replicating the investment represented
    by these packages is prohibitive. Freescale Semiconductors, an industry leader in
    advanced integrated circuits, have recently announced the availability of a single
    chip automotive radar solution at different frequencies. These single-chip solutions
    are state-of-the-art technologies that integrate the entire front-end of a radar
    system into a single surface mount device, that occupies less that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1
    sq. cm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This product significantly miniaturizes a potential
    collision avoidance system.&amp;nbsp; However, these radars are calibrated for use
    in an automotive application. Radar reflectivity and target detection is based on
    known radar cross sections for typical vehicular use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our effort,
    we will evaluate a Delphi or similar radar solution for MSFC&amp;rsquo;s Mighty
    Eagle and Lunar Surface Testbed. In the first year evaluation will with a static
    platform. The evaluation will consist of understanding the radar signature (at automotive
    radar frequencies) of a simulated lunar surface and also evaluate the performance
    of the built-in target detection capability of a COTS radar system. In addition,
    we will begin evaluation of the Freescale Semiconductor solution. This will enhance
    our in-house capability to design and build our own system that will incorporate
    the knowledge gained from using the Delphi system in the terrain field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There
    are several significant elements in the evaluation.&amp;nbsp; Here we specifically
    note the following to give some indication of the range and nature of the elements.
    (1) What interference to other spacecraft systems might happen?&amp;nbsp; (2) How
    does placement on the spacecraft affect the performance of the radar? (3) What is
    the distance-object size-surface morphology-particle size-particle shape-particle
    composition detectability performance? (4) How sensitive are the tests to moisture
    in the simulant?&amp;nbsp; The later point is a practical concern that must be addressed
    in order to evaluate the other elements. &amp;nbsp;We are aware that rocket exhaust
    can interfere with radar frequencies.&amp;nbsp; The significant of this effect at
    the target wavelengths with our instrument/lander geometry for an interferometric
    system will be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
