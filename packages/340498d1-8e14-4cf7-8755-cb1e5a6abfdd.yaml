    place to work towards CRCP's strategic goals to reduce fishing impacts on coral
    reefsnnBuilding GIS Long-term Capacity: technical assistance for the State of Hawaii
    DAR and other U.S. Pacific Jurisdictions: To support geospatial capacity building
    in the state of Hawaii we will provide basic GIS training using ESRI ArcGIS software
    to scientists and staff in the Division of Aquatic Resources (DAR).  Staff will
    learn how to create and share a GIS map, find and organize geographic data and other
    content for a mapping project, accurately display features on a GIS map and access
    information about them. The training will also cover performing spatial analyses
    to answer questions, updating of an MMA data layer, and sharing GIS maps and analysis
    results easily accessible to desktop, web, and mobile device users.nnLimits of Acceptable
    Change Pilot Study in the NE Reserves and Culebra to support the development of
    management actions: PRDNER needs to conduct a characterization project in the priority
    northeast marine area extending from the Ru00c3u00ado Espu00c3u00adritu Santo Natural
    Reserve to the Cordillera and Luis Peu00c3u00b1a Reserves that addresses human uses
    and use patterns, user knowledge and perceptions and use conflicts to address data
    gaps essential to effective management and determine limits of acceptable change
    (LAC). The project will assess resource use and social conditions, evaluating the
    status and trend of these conditions.nnAerial Surveys of Boater Use in the Florida
    Keys National Marine Sanctuary: The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS)
    encompasses approximately 2,900 nm2 of coastal and oceanic waters that are utilized
    extensively by boaters involved in both consumptive and non-consumptive activities.
    The purpose of this project is to acquire quantitative data on the number, type,
    activity, and distribution of vessels to understand usage patterns in the FKNMS.
    This information is essential to help sanctuary managers better manage sanctuary
    resources, inform modifications to or the creation of new marine zones, and for
    revision of the overall sanctuary management plan.  nnQuantifying Processes That
    Underpin Recovery at Kahekili HFMA: Biological monitoring surveys inside the Kahekili
    Herbivore Fisheries Management Area (KHFMA) demonstrate increases in herbivore biomass
    and crustose coralline algal (CCA) cover since closure in 2009, but thus far only
    small increases in coral cover.  This project will maintain cooperative monitoring
    of the KHFMA with Hawaii DAR, but at a reduced level. In addition, comparable surveys
    will be conducted on closely unprotected reefs within the West Maui priority watershed
    areas, as the lack of coral reef biological information for that areas data has
    been identified as a major data gap by Maui Ridge2Reef program.nnDefining spawning
    dynamics to manage and conserve reef fish populations: Large predators are important
    in healthy coral reef ecosystems, however many populations of these species are
    depleted in the US Caribbean. Commercially important species, e.g., large grouper,
    that gather annually to spawn, are highly susceptible to overfishing and managers
    need better data on aggregation locations and dynamics to effectively conserve these
    resources. This project is collaboratively monitoring and assessing spawning aggregation
    sites off western Puerto Rico, and will use these methods, with demonstrated effectiveness,
    to locate, assess, and monitor grouper spawning aggregations in the NE Reserves
    of PR, confirming locations, species, aggregation timing and species abundances.nnImpacts
    of fishing on parrotfish grazing in St. Croix - A case study on the ecological impacts
    of fishery management actions: This project develops a quantitative framework to
    predict the impacts of fisheries for parrotfishes on the capacity of these key herbivores
    to remove algae and maintain habitat suitable for the settlement and growth of reef-building
    corals in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. This research will allow us to develop specific
    recommendations for managers by identifying management strategies that can maintain
    high levels of grazing that benefit reef-building corals while also supporting a
    robust and sustainable fishery.nnStrengthening sustainable socioeconomic monitoring
    of reef-dependent communities in Micronesia (Guam and Hawaii): The proposed project
    will continue to build capacity and provide technical assistance for strengthening
    and sustaining socioeconomic monitoring (SEM) in reef-dependent communities at site,
    jurisdictional, and regional levels in Micronesia and Hawaii. Training will build
    on key results of the FY15 SEM capacity-building assessment survey. Based on results
    of SEM assessment of the Habitat Blueprint site Manell-Geus in FY 15, a draft integrated
    monitoring plan will be revised to ensure the complementarity of biophysical and
    socioeconomic data and improve coral reef management and conservation. Existing
    SEM data sets will be reviewed to develop recommendations for a data management
    plan.nnDevelop and Implement a Socio-Economic Monitoring Component for the Guam
    Community Coral Reef Monitoring Program: This project will expand a successful,
    well-established community monitoring and education program focusing on Guamu00e2u0080u0099s
    Marine Preserves and priority watershed areas. In addition to maintaining and improving
    current activities and community relations through programs such as Adopt-a-Reef
    and Eyes of the Reef Marianas, the Program Coordinator will expand the program by
    developing protocols to integrate socioeconomic and biophysical data sets and enhance
    information exchange with the community and resource managers through the production
    of standard scorecard for reefs in the program.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
