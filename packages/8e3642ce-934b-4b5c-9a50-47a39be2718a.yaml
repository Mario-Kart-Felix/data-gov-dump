    null,nt"notes": "The GeoStor Platform enables the user to leverage access to
    Arkansasu00e2u0080u0099 GIS data and utilize the GIS data in a number of ways. The
    information below is intended to provide an overview of the many ways the GeoStor
    Platform is or could be used. GIS Data Publisher Updates: The GeoStor Platform provides
    publishers a wide range of options for maintaining their data in the database. The
    updates can be performed via database connection, and/or automated processes. The
    publisher is in control of the refresh rate for their data. Contact the GeoStor
    Staff for more information. Web services (WS): The GeoStor Platform is architected
    to provide a range of web services. Offsite Publisher (OFF): The GeoStor Platform
    provides users with links to known data that resides outside the GeoStor architecture.
    Additional links to u00e2u0080u0098off site publishersu00e2u0080u0099 are added
    regularly. Offsite published information, that are available from GeoStor in this
    manner are signified by OFF in the type column. Application (APP): The GeoStor Platform
    enables state/local government entities to create applications with the GeoStor
    hardware and software. Hardware, software, and hosting are provided in a robust
    physically and cyber secure environment for no fee. Applications are required to
    provide access to the GIS data that is used. Applications that are available from
    GeoStor in this manner are signified by APP in the type column. Web Map Service
    (WMS): The GeoStor Platform produces open access to maps of spatially referenced
    data dynamically from geographic information. This international standard defines
    a "map" to be a portrayal of geographic information as a digital image file suitable
    for display on a computer screen. A map is not the data itself. WMS-produced maps
    are generally rendered in a pictorial format such as PNG, GIF or JPEG, or occasionally
    as vector-based graphical elements in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) or Web Computer
    Graphics Metafile (WebCGM) formats. This is in contrast to a Web Feature Service
    (WFS), which returns actual vector data, and a Web Coverage Service (WCS), which
    returns actual gridded data. WMS that are available from GeoStor in this manner
    are signified by WMS in the type column. Web Feature Service (WFS): The GeoStor
    Platform provides an interface allowing requests for geographical features across
    the web using platform-independent calls. One can think of geographical features
    as the "source code" behind a map, whereas the WMS interface or online mapping
    systems like Google Maps return only an image, which end-users cannot edit or spatially
    analyze. WFS that are available from GeoStor in this manner are signified by WFS
    in the type column. Downloadable Data (DL): The GeoStor Platform provides users
    with the capability to search for data and receive (the area of interest) in the
    format, projection and coordinate system they desire. This is often times referred
    to as clip, zip, and ship. Data that are available from GeoStor in this manner is
    signified by DL in the type column. File Transfer Protocol (FTP): The GeoStor Platform
    provides users with access to raster files that are larger than the downloadable
    limit. Data that is available from GeoStor in this manner is signified by FTP in
    the type column. Help Documents (HLP): Documents that provide GeoStor users with
    helpful information about the GeoStor Platform. Disaster Events (EMG): The GeoStor
    Platform is architected to provide for the quick ingestion of data to support natural
    or manmade events. Users will be able to quickly locate information for an event
    using common keywords specific to the event. Metadata: The GeoStor Platform is powered
    by metadata. Information about all of the features, services, options, and even
    the help documentation are stored in xml metadata files.",nt"license_title":
