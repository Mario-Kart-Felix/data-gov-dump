    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The Digital SAR Mosaic and Elevation Map
    of the Greenland Ice Sheet CD-ROM combines the most detailed synthetic aperture
    radar (SAR) image mosaic available with the best current digital elevation model.
    The mosaic image shows both the location of the ice edge and the distribution of
    melt-related 'scatterers' on the surface. These scatterers include ice lenses and
    complex layered structure in the percolation zone and bare ice of the ablation zone.
     Other melt-related features that can be seen include lake and surface meltwater
    stream channels at lower elevations, as well as ice-marginal lakes.nnThis characterization
    of the ice sheet provides a reference against which future change can be measured.
    Changing conditions resulting from climatic variation should show up as changes
    in the ice margin and shifts in the hydrologic zones. It is hoped that the standard
    reference provided by this data set can facilitate activities aimed at change detection
    and promote other work aimed at understanding the processes operating on the ice
    sheet.nnThe image data are derived from SAR image swaths acquired by the ERS-1 satellite
    during August of 1992. The mosaic was assembled at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
    (JPL) and Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Its component images are a copyrighted
    product of the European Space Agency. The mosaic, a value-added derived product,
    is available to individuals and non-profit organizations for research oriented purposes
    only. The Danish geodetic and cadastral agency Kort-og Matrikelstyrelsen (KMS) compiled
    the elevation data provided with the product from a number of sources, including
    field surveys, aerial photographs, and the ERS-1 radar altimeter. The elevation
    data are also provided only to individuals and non-profit organizations for research
    oriented purposes. Included with the data is NSIDC's limb (large image map browser)
    software, which was developed in-house and allows UNIX users to easily select and
    view portions of the mosaic image with elevation contours derived from the elevation
    data overlain. Limb is provided as 'freeware' for general use. NSIDC distributes
    the Digital SAR Mosaic and Elevation Map of the Greenland Ice Sheet on CD-ROM at
    no charge.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
