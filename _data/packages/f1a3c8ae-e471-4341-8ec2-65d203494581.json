	"notes": "The overall objective of this STTR effort is to evaluate and demonstrate the potential for well-designed, strategically-located synthetic jet actuators to provide improved aircraft safety by: (1) delaying wing stall and improving aircraft controllability at high angles of attack and (2) providing low-cost actuation redun-dancy to improve controllability in the event of a mechanical control surface failure.  Delaying flow separa-tion (i.e., wing stall) and providing "back-up" control power could allow an aircraft to recover from adverse conditions (due to a control surface failure, pilot/autopilot error, etc.) that would otherwise result in a loss of control.rnFlow control studies have shown that synthetic jet actuators are efficient devices for controlling separated internal and external flows.  However, an obstacle to the widespread application of synthetic jet actuators for practical flight control is that modulated input signals to achieve closed-loop flow control objectives have been shown to be complex.  Barron Associates, the University of Virginia, and the University of Wyoming propose to develop a software toolbox for the creation of adaptive control systems for actuators having complex, nonlinear dynamics.  The Phase II effort will culminate in a wind tunnel test that quanti-fies the safety improvement potential offered by adaptively-controlled synthetic jet actuators.rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
