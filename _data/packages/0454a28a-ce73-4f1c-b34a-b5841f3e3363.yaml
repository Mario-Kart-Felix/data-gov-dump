    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;A key technical difference (aside
    from the differences in toxicity) between Hydrazine and the green propellant alternatives
    is the combustion temperature.&amp;nbsp; Both types of propellants are dispensed
    from their feed tanks through a catalyst material.&amp;nbsp; The catalyst decomposes
    (reacts) with each propellant and creates the high temperature exhaust gases that
    are used to either provide thrust (in the application of a rocket engine) or to
    spin the turbine which provides power to an APU or EPU.&amp;nbsp; Hydrazine decomposes
    at 900 deg C while the green propellants decompose at 1600 deg C.&amp;nbsp; However,
    the existing H-70 catalyst (Shell 405) works best with dual-bonded nitrogen mixtures.&amp;nbsp;
    Both ADN and HAN offer this dual-bonded feature.&amp;nbsp; Although the green propellants
    may burn hotter with their own proprietary catalyst material, they will burn cooler
    with the Shell 405 product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, both propellants are
    mixed with water and the water content can be increased to further reduce combustion
    temperatures.&amp;nbsp; For this proposal, KSC will ship their green sensors (either
    for ADN or HAN) to MSFC and we in turn would instrument the EPU dedicated to that
    propellant.&amp;nbsp; Following completion of one month of testing the EPU instrumented
    with leak detection sensors, the hardware would be shipped to DFRC for a ground
    test inside an F-16 aircraft.&amp;nbsp; For the chosen aircraft, the existing H-70
    system would be temporarily replaced with the MSFC provided green propellant EPU
    and the aircraft would be suspended off the ground (jacked) to simulate an engine
    failure and resultant use of the EPU.&amp;nbsp; The objective would be to show that
    the landing gear could be deployed and aero control surfaces would properly move
    to pilot commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternative approaches
    to providing power to an APU include an external gas blowdown system, a Lithium
    Ion battery driven motor or a thermal battery driven motor.&amp;nbsp; All of these
    approaches have some drawbacks.&amp;nbsp; An external gas blowdown system may employ
    the use of a stored gas, most likely Helium, to drive the APU turbine.&amp;nbsp;
    The primary disadvantage to this system is the mass and volume required to store
    the compressed gas.&amp;nbsp; A similar approach that would minimize the mass and
    volume is to use gaseous Hydrogen tapped off a liquid propellant rocket engine.&amp;nbsp;
    However, APU checkouts would be problematic without the engine in operation.&amp;nbsp;
    An additional system would be required to provide the gas for checkout purposes.&amp;nbsp;
    In addition, future launch system elements may not have direct access to the liquid
    rocket engine and would require a disconnect for staging adding to its complexity.&amp;nbsp;
    Lithium Ion batteries require many cells that must be matched which drive the weight
    and costs.&amp;nbsp; The disadvantage of thermal batteries lies in its operation
    or turnaround.&amp;nbsp; For APU checkouts, an external power source is required
    and in the event of a launch abort or scrub, these batteries must be replaced.&amp;nbsp;
    These green propellants provide a high power density packaged power source that
    can be started multiple times with minimal effects on turnaround from issues presented.&amp;nbsp;
    In addition, this propellant could not only provide a propellant source for APU&amp;rsquo;s
    but also launch vehicle roll control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
