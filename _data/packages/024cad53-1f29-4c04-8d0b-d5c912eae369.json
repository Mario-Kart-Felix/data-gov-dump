	"notes": "Biofilms are ubiquitous in the environment.  Few surfaces resist biofilmnformation, most promote it.  Biofilm formation poses problems in waternsystems as they can clog pipes and pores, block filters, reduce heatntransfer, and in general restrict flow.  Their metabolic products cannaid corrosion, even of stainless steel.  In potable water systems, bothntheir metabolic products and the bacteria or fungi themselves directlynpose a health hazard.  A space environment appears to be a particularlynfavorable one for biofilm formation.  Cell cultures have shown farnhigher rates of growth in low-gravity environments.  Space radiationnseems to accelerate microbial growth and foster their mutation.  Withinna closed environment with many non-replaceable resources, prevention ofnbiofilm formation is paramount.  To meet this need, Agave BioSystems andnthe Universities Space Research Association, propose to develop carbonnnanotubes (CNTs) and other nanostructures for the prevention of biofilmngrowth.  In this Phase I, we propose to demonstrate that the use ofnnanostructured materials can prevent or inhibit growth of biofilms duento geometry effects and that they can also be functionalized with a biocide.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
