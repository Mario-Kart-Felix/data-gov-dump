  images of sea surface temperature (SST) in the Gulf of Maine. These raster images
  are a composite of several years (1997-2005) binned by season or by month, and were
  calculated as means or as medians. For those images binned by month, all of the
  months for the time series were averaged together to make one mean image. For example,
  Jan '98, Jan '99, Jan 00, Jan 01, Jan 02, Jan 03, Jan 04 = Grand Monthly Mean for
  January. For those images binned by season, the seasons were defined as the following:
  1) Fall= September, October, November; 2) Winter= December, January, February; 3)
  Spring= March, April, May; 4) Summer= June, July, August. All chlorophyll geotifs
  binned by year and season were then averaged again to create a grand mean for each
  season. For example, spring '98, spring '99, spring 00, spring 01, spring 02, spring
  03, spring 04 = Grand Seasonal Mean for Spring.These images were also reprocessed
  to remove land and no data values (value = 252 and value = 0 respectively), as well
  as to calculate the real world values for sea surface temperature in degrees Celsius
  (C).\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819\",\n\t\"extras\":
