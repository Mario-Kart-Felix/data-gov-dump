Objective: Using advanced metal combustion systems for power generation through turbines and Sterling engines rather than relying on radioisotope power systems Several targets of interest in solar system exploration require non-solar power sources due to permanent shading from craters or clouds due to extreme distance from the sun. These missions are typically considered with radioisotope power sources, but the scarcity of such fuel reduces the number of missions that NASA can execute in any decade. This study will explore mission architectures to the Moon&amp;#39;s southern Aitken Basin, the surface of Saturn&amp;rsquo;s moon, Titan, and the surface of Venus that do not rely on Plutonium for power, but instead are powered by a metal-combustion engine. The Applied Research Lab at Penn State has been developing advanced metal combustion systems for power generation through turbines and Sterling engines that have significantly higher energy density than chemical batteries. This NIAC study team will choose one of these missions to study in detail at the NASA Glenn Research Center&amp;#39;s COMPASS Lab, resulting in a mission concept report. Proving the feasibility of using metal combustion to power spacecraft in sunless regions would be a breakthrough and shift our expectation of what explorations are possible through Discovery and New Frontiers missions without relying on radioisotope power sources.&lt;/p&gt;rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
