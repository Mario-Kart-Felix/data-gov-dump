    3 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of selected portions of seafloor around
    Isla de Mona in Puerto Rico, derived from data collected in 2008. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA
    Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory,
    federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in Puerto
    Rico from 2/25/08 to 3/8/08. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad
    EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) in 2008. It was processed by a NOAA contractor
    using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity)
    and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and
    zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 19 north, datum NAD83. The processed
    CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. An ASCII
    XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and imported to ESRI ArcMap 9.2 using
    the Convert XYZ to Raster tool developed by CCMA for this purpose. The project was
    conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project
    area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data
    according to their own needs and standards.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
