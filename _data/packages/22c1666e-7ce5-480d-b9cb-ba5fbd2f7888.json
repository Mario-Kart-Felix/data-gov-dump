	"notes": "The use of UAS's in the military and the commercial field has grown tremendously over the last few years and is set to explode over next several. An open-architecture avionics system that utilizes standard communication interfaces and allows for rapid reconfiguration would be an attractive addition to the UAS market. rnCTSi is proposing development of such a product in phase II that provides a full Avionics Suite. This would include an avionics platform, a closed loop test environment and development tool kit and provide a turnkey solution for NASA AirSTAR program. The system will include:rnrn1)tpowerful programmability, ease of integration of new sensors and actuators, and ease of expansion to new platforms and applicationsrn2)tinterfaces for sensor inputs in Analog, PWM and serial stream formatsrn3)tA high performance data link for data telemetry and controlrn4)treliable ground based safety piloting and augmented safety pilot control modesrn5)tOperations in an EMI sensitive environmentrn6)tAn autopilot fail-safe mode with basic aircraft recovery and Return-To-Base (RTB) capability and custom control law integrationrn7)tsupport for a variety of GPS/INS and other aircraft sensorsrn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
