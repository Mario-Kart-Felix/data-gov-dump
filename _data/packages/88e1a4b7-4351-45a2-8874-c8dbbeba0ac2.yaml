  Independent Survey (SEFIS) are conducting research on Red Snapper (lutjanus campechanus).
  The multibeam data covers a total of 232 sq km and was collected in 2010 by the
  NOAA Ship Nancy Foster with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echo
  sounder (95 kHz). It was processed by NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch
  using CARIS HIPS 7.1 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound
  velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved
  tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. The processed CARIS data was used to generate
  a CARIS BASE surface using CUBE. The CARIS export option \"BASE Surface to ASCII\"
  was then used to create a GeoTiff of the priority areas in ArcGIS 10. Slope was
  derived from this surface using the Slope function in ArcGIS Spatial Analyst.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
