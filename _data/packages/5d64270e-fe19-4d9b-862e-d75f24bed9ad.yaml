  measurements, which are sensitive to electromagnetic discontinuities in the snowpack,
  made during the 2002 and 2003 Cold Land Processes Field Experiment (CLPX). The microwave
  interaction with a snow pack was measured using broadband frequency modulated continuous
  wave (FMCW) radar operating at between 2 and 18 GHz, incorporating the following
  frequencies: C-Band (2-6 GHz), X-Band (8-12 GHz), and Ku-Band (14-18 GHz). Measurements
  were made at the Local Scale Observation Site (LSOS) near Fraser, Colorado, during
  Intensive Observation Periods (IOP) 1 and 2 (February and March, 2002), and at four
  different sites covering each of the three Mesocell Study Areas (MSAs) during IOP
  3 and 4 (February and March, 2003). Active microwave radar signals are reflected
  and scattered by electromagnetic discontinuities that affect radar backscatter signatures.
  The location and magnitude of these discontinuities in a snow pack must be identified
  as a function of microwave frequency in order to accurately invert snow cover properties
  from active and passive microwave remote sensing systems. Consequently, in conjunction
  with the radar measurements, detailed snow pit measurements were taken at a nearby
  site in order to correlate the radar profile with the snow pit records.nnThis investigation
  found that radar operating at 14-18 GHz contains the most information about the
  internal features of a dry snow pack. However, the high-frequency radar is of limited
  use in wet snow due to the high absorption loss in water. For a wet snowpack, radar
  operating at lower frequencies (2-6 GHz) was necessary for penetrating to the snow-ground
  interface. These findings suggest that a dual-frequency approach for radar remote
  sensing may be necessary to retrieve snow pack parameters such as density, depth,
  and wetness.nnThe NASA CLPX is a multi-sensor, multi-scale experiment that focuses
  on extending a local-scale understanding of water fluxes, storage, and transformations
  to regional and global scales. Within a framework of nested study areas in the central
  Rocky Mountains of the western United States, ranging from 1-ha to 160,000 km2,
  intensive ground, airborne, and spaceborne observations are collected. Data collection
  focuses on two seasons: mid-winter, when conditions are generally frozen and dry,
  and early spring, a transitional period when both frozen and thawed, dry and wet
  conditions are widespread.\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S. Government Work\",\n\t\"extras\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
