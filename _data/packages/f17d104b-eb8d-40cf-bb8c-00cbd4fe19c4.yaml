  by a cooperative project between the U.S. Geological Survey, Eagle County, the Eagle
  River Water and Sanitation District, the Town of Eagle, the Town of Gypsum, and
  the Upper Eagle Regional Water Authority. This project was designed to evaluate
  potential land-development effects on groundwater and surface-water resources so
  that informed land-use and water management decisions can be made. This groundwater
  probability map and its associated probability maps were developed as follows: (1)
  A point data set of wells with groundwater quality and groundwater age data was
  overlaid with thematic layers of anthropogenic (related to human activities) and
  hydrogeologic data by using a geographic information system to assign each well
  values for depth to groundwater, distance to major streams and canals, distance
  to gypsum beds, precipitation, soils, and well depth. These data then were downloaded
  to a statistical software package for analysis by logistic regression. (2) Statistical
  models predicting the probability of elevated nitrate concentrations, the probability
  of unmixed young water (using chlorofluorocarbon-11 concentrations and tritium activities),
  and the probability of elevated volatile organic compound concentrations were developed
  using logistic regression techniques. (3) The statistical models were entered into
  a GIS and the probability map was constructed.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\":

  This probability map represents the probability of the occurrence of unmixed young
  groundwater in the Eagle River watershed valley-fill. Probability is a statistical
  measure of how likely an event will occur. Probability is not the same as certainty.
  Although the probability maps show predictions as a percent probability, there is
  inherent uncertainty within these predictions that is not shown in the probability
  map. This probability map is intended to be a first approximation at developing
  a consistent rating method for the entire study area and may have several limitations
  for use at the site or field scale. The model and map does not account for features
  and processes that may promote focused recharge, preferential groundwater flow,
  or bypass mechanisms. Additional site-specific data are needed before site-specific
  decisions are made. The Eagle River watershed is rapidly being developed. As development
  activities continue, some variables such as surficial soils and irrigation networks
  may be altered through construction activities, which may have unpredictable effects
  on the groundwater probability ratings. This probability map should not be used
  at a scale any larger than 1:24,000, which is the scale of the SSURGO soils data.
  Probably the most appropriate scale to use this data set is 1:100,000, which would
  help take into account the combined inaccuracies of the input data sets used to
  develop this final data set.\", \"Access Constraints: None\"]\"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"key\":
