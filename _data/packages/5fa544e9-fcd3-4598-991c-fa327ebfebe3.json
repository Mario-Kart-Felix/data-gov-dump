		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

	"notes": "The Coastal Zone Color Scanner Experiment (CZCS) was the first instrument devoted to\nthe measurement of ocean color and flown on a spacecraft. Although other instruments\nflown on other spacecraft had sensed ocean color, their spectral bands, spatial\nresolution and dynamic range were optimized for land or meteorological use and had\nlimited sensitivity in this area, whereas in CZCS, every parameter was optimized for\nuse over water to the exclusion of any other type of sensing. CZCS had six spectral\nbands, four of which were used primarily for ocean color. These were of a 20 nanometer\nbandwidth centered at 443, 520, 550, and 670 nm. Band 5 had a 100 nm bandwidth centered\nat 750 nm and a dynamic range more suited to land. Band 6 operated in the 10.5 to 12.5\nmicrometer region and sensed emitted thermal radiance for derivation of equivalent\nblack body temperature. (This thermal band failed within the first year of the mission,\nand so was not used in the global processing effort.) Bands 1-4 were preset to view\nwater only and saturated when the IFOV was over most types of land surfaces, or clouds.",
