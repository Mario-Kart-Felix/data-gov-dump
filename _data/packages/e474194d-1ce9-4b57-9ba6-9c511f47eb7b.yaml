  information. The vector data contain selected base categories of geographic features,
  and characteristics of these features, in digital form. The information was collected
  by clipping the existing STATSGO soils map to the State of Louisiana boundary. The
  data set used the existing STATSGO soil maps as a data development resource. The
  classified data was derived from actual field identification and sampling performed
  by the United States Department of Agriculture and the Soil Conservation Service.
  Review the metadata file for more information. Coverage is of the entire State of
  Louisiana. The original STATSGO map is a digital general soil association map developed
  by the National Cooperative Survey. It consists of a broad based inventory of soils
  and nonsoil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can
  be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. The soil maps for STATSGO are compiled
  by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Map unit composition for a STATSGO
  map is determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and
  expanding the data statistically to characterize the whole map unit. The data set
  consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The
  map data are collected in 1- by 2- degree topographic quadrangle units and merged
  and distributed as statewide coverages. The soil map units are linked to attributes
  in the Map Unit Interpretations Record relational data base which give the proportionate
  extent of the component soils and their properties.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\":

  Acknowledgement of the National Wetlands Research Center as a data source would
  be appreciated in products developed from these data, and such acknowledgement as
  is standard for citation and legal practices for data source is expected by users
  of this data. Sharing new data layers developed directly from these data would also
  be appreciated by NWRC staff. Users should be aware of that comparisons with other
  data sets for the same area from other time periods may be inaccurate due to inconsistencies
  resulting from changes in photo interpretation, mapping conventions, and digital
  processes over time. These data are not legal documents and are not to be used as
  such.In addition, STATSGO was designed primarily for regional, multicounty, river
  basin, State, and multistate resource planning, management, and monitoring. STATSGO
  data are not detailed enough to make interpretations at a county level. This soil
  survey product is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting
  or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference source. The use of these data
  is not restricted and may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government,
  or others; however, they are responsible for its appropriate application. Federal,
  State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Soil Conservation Service
  any authority for the decisions that they make. The Soil Conservation Service will
  not perform any evaluations of these maps for purposes related solely to state or
  local regulatory programs. When STATSGO data are overlayed with other data layers,
  such as land use data, caution must be used in generating statistics on the co-occurrence
  of the land use data with the soil data. The composition of the STATSGO map unit
  can be characterized independently for the land use and for the soil component,
  but there are no data on their joint occurrence at a more detailed level. Analysis
  of the overlayed data should be on a map polygon basis. The approximate minimum
  area delineated is 625 hectares (1,544 acres), which is represented on a 1:250,000-scale
  map by an area approximately 1 cm by 1 cm (0.4 inch by 0.4 inch). Linear delineations
  are not less than 0.5 cm (0.2 inch) in width. The number of delineations per 1:250,000
  quadrangle typically is 100 to 200, but may range up to 400. Delineations depict
  the dominant soils making up the landscape. Other dissimilar soils, too small to
  be delineated, are present within a delineation. Digital enlargements of these maps
  to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation
  of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils
  that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations,
  and analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing,
  and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their
  interpretations are intended for planning purposes only.\", \"Access Constraints:
