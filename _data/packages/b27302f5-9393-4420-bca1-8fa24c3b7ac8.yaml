    data set (Ramankutty and Foley 1999a). The subset was created for the study area
    of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) in South America
    (i.e., 10 N to 25 S, 30 to 85 W). The data are in ASCII GRID format at 5-min resolution.Navin
    Ramankutty and Jonathan Foley, of the Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment
    (SAGE) at the University of Wisconsin, developed a global, spatially explicit data
    set of reconstructed historical croplands from 1700 to 1992. The method for historical
    reconstruction used a simple algorithm that linked contemporary satellite data and
    historical cropland inventory data. A spatially explicit croplands data set for
    1992 was first derived by calibrating a satellite-derived land cover classification
    data set against cropland inventory data for 1992. This derived data set was then
    used within a simple land cover change model, along with historical cropland inventory
    data, to derive spatially explicit maps of historical croplands. The global data
    set was restricted to a representation of permanent croplands (i.e., excluding shifting
    cultivation), which follows the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) definition
    of arable lands and permanent crops. Data values represent fraction of grid cell
    in croplands.Data for the LBA study area are available for the years 1900, 1910,
    1920, 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, and 1992. Although the global croplands
    data set contains data representing croplands since 1700, essentially no croplands
    were in the LBA study area until 1900. Data from previous years were excluded at
    the suggestion of the data originator.More information can be found at ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/lba/land_use_land_cover_change/historical_croplands/comp/uwcrop_readme.pdf.LBA
    was a cooperative international research initiative led by Brazil. NASA was a lead
    sponsor for several experiments. LBA was designed to create the new knowledge needed
    to understand the climatological, ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological functioning
    of Amazonia; the impact of land use change on these functions; and the interactions
    between Amazonia and the Earth system. More information about LBA can be found at

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
