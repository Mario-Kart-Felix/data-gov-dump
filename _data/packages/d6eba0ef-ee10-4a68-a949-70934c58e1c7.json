	"notes": "Laser diodes are the key component in many space-based applications ranging from communication systems to optical sensors/detectors.  Laser diode emitters however dissipate large amounts of waste heat of their own from the small footprint of the device.  As a result, the dissipating heat flux from the laser diodes can reach a level as high as 1kW/cm2.  The performance and reliability of laser diode arrays can degrade severely if the waste heat is not properly managed.  Indeed temperature control is critical when the laser diode arrays are used for pumping a solid-state laser such as Nd:YAG.  The solid-state laser has a narrow absorption bandwidth and requires a narrow pump source.  Any variation in temperature throughout the array will cause the emitters to emit different wavelengths, thus increasing the bandwidth of the array.  Spray cooling is probably the only available thermal control technology capable of dispersing heat fluxes of this extreme level (&gt;200W/cm2).  Spray cooling is a heat removal method by an evaporative heat transfer process.  In this research project, a novel concept that combines a conventional refrigeration cycle and spray cooling technique into one system is proposed as the solution to extremely high heat flux problems.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
