	"notes": "ORBITEC proposes to develop a non-thermal technology based onnatmospheric-pressure (AP) cold plasma to sanitize foods, food packagingnmaterials, and other hardware and working surfaces that are encounterednduring food processing in space vehicles or habitats. AP plasma is wellnknown to be highly effective in promoting oxidation, enhancing molecularndissociation, and producing free radicals and other types of highnenergies. It has recently attracted much attention in food industry duento its potential of being a non-thermal and highly effective sanitationnmethod. The proposed technology will support sanitation of foodnpreparation surfaces and equipment, food storage containers, and surfacensanitation of delivered fresh fruit and vegetables, and freshly preparednfoods in a space based habitat. It can function in reduced gravity andnpressure environments, and is efficient in terms of waste and resourcenuse. It may also have applications in air and water purification,nallowing some sharing of components and training procedures. During thisnPhase I effort, two different reactor designs will be built and tested.nTheir performance will be evaluated on tomato, lettuce, Teflon, and/ornother non-food substrates, all of which will be inoculated withnSalmonella enterica.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
