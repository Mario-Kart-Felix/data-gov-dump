	"notes": "This data set contains a single text file which reports vertical profiles of H2O vapor concentrations measured at the Para Western (Santarem) - km 67, Primary Forest Tower Site (Figure 1). This site is in the Tapajos National Forest located in north central Brazil. Measurements extend from January 2002 through January 2006.H2O concentrations were measured at 8 levels on the tower (62.2, 50, 39.4, 28.7, 19.6, 10.4, and 0.91 m). Sample air was drawn at 1000 sccm (standard cubic centimeters per minute) through 8 profile inlets in sequence (2 minutes at each level) and then a mixed air sample was simultaneously drawn from all 8 levels to obtain a total column integral (once every 20 minutes) and analyzed with an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA, LI-6262, Licor, Lincoln, NE). Data were averaged over a 1 hour interval. Calibration for H2O used two independent calibrations for the IRGA concentration measurements: (a) the nighttime relationship between ambient temperature measurements and sonic temperature measurements; (b) a chilled mirror dew point hygrometer mounted on the tower. See Appendix A of  Hutyra (2007) for addition details about calibration methods. Co-located measurements included eddy fluxes of CO2 and H2O were measured at two levels (58m and 47m) using tower-mounted closed-path Licor 6262 gas analyzers and Campbell CSAT3 sonic anemometers. And a comprehensive set of meteorological parameters (air temperature, pressure, PAR, net radiation, precipitation, etc) were also measured. With the permission of the author, Hutyra, L.R. 2007.

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
