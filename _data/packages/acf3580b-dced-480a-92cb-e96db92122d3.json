	"notes": "Regional management have requested that a prioritization process be developed for Region 8 for development and completion of Water Resources Inventory and Assessments (WRIA) that best meet Regional priorities and focus on Refuges where water resources issues are most critical. A ranking system was developed to prioritize WRIAs for Refuges based on determining goals and objectives for successful and efficient development of WRIAs for Refuges. Refuges were ranked to receive a WRIA by how well they met the following goals and objectives. Refuge has a need for a WRIA (maximize need): WRIAs should be prioritized towards Refuges that have significant water resources issues that affect the ability of the Refuge to carry out management objectives.u2022tGreater severity of water supply and quality issues, complexity of water entitlement issues, and highly vulnerable to climate changeu2022tRefuge staff requested a WRIA, assistance with understanding water rights, and assistance with hydrologic monitoringRegion 8 I&M should focus first on refuges in which the WRIA is easier to conduct (minimize difficulty): to improve efficiency and make greater progress toward completion with limited staff resources and time. u2022tBreadth and complexity of water supply sources, water quality, water entitlements, and water management issues are minimalu2022tRefuge water rights or water policy issues are relatively stableu2022tRefuge has easily accessible hydrologic monitoring datau2022tRefuge has well organized and well documented water informationThe needs and difficulty objectives were trade-offs (for example, a Refuge with complex water resources issues needs of a WRIA, but is also difficult to complete); there was a correlation between need and difficulty. We identified Refuges that are in the top third scores for greatest need. Among those Refuges, we prioritized those Refuges that were the least difficult to complete.",
