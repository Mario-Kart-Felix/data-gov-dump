	"notes": "For NASA missions requiring active control of segmented mirrors, opticalntrusses and booms, coherent, laser-based approaches such as CW laserninterferometers have been preferred because they can provide very highnresolution relative position measurements.  Other approaches, such asnmulti-color interferometers can provide absolute range measurements.nHowever, neither technique can measure multiple retroreflectors with ansingle optical transceiver.  This has led to complex distributednmetrology systems, which are limited in usefulness.  Bridger PhotonicsnInc. proposes to investigate a novel distributed metrology approach thatnis uniquely enabled by its SLM-Series of actively stabilized swept lasernsources.  The technique, termed multi-point trilateration, uses anfrequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) chirped laser radar tondetermine the range to multiple reflectors that are illuminatednsimultaneously by three or more large field-of-view transceivers.nBecause Bridger's laser radar system can unambiguously determine thenrange to multiple targets within the field-of-view with high accuracy,ntrilateration can be utilized to estimate the three-dimensional (3D)ncoordinates for all of the retroreflective targets within thenfield-of-view.  Bridger provides two critical advantages for thendevelopment of this distributed metrology system:  1) The world'snhighest resolution laser radar system, which is crucial for determiningnthe range to the multiple retroreflectors, and 2) Proprietary processingntechniques that enable Cramer-Rao lower bound limited range estimation.nUnder the proposed work plan, Bridger will provide an optimal design fornTransceiver/Retroreflector geometries and model the expectednperformance, conduct demonstrations validating the system performancenand provide a space-qualifiable, compact system design that can be builtnand delivered to NASA during a Phase II effort should the approach be feasible.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
