	"notes": "Diamond turning is able to produce highly aspheric visible quality optics which can be easily aligned.rnrnVery large optical systems such as OWL and EUSO are impossible to produce using diamond turning because machines capable of machining 3 meter size optics do not exist.  This is because no air bearing  spindle is available with load capacity for the weight of the optical component and the required heavy part holding fixture.rnrnLarge diamond turning machines today have oil hydrostatic spindles which are not useful for very large diamond turning because of excessive heat generation when this type bearing is large enough to have load capacity for very large optics.rnrnThe viscosity of air is more than three orders of magnitude less than oil, therefore the heating of large diameter air bearings is very small.rnrnThe extreme precision required for air bearings is in the realm of optical tolerances.rnrnAir bearings utilizing two metal surfaces in close contact fail in large sizes because metals weld together in the event of the slightest touch.rnrnPorous graphite air bearings do not friction weld in the event of the spindle bearing surface contacting the bearing journal surface.  The porous graphite flow structure provides uniform flow to damp the instability that is a problem with air hydrostatic bearings.rnrnThis proposal combines porous graphite air bearing technology with optical fabrication methods to build a new type of vertical axis air bearing for diamond turning machine use.  The goal of this Phase I SBIR effort will be to demonstrate the technology with a sub-scale air bearing spindle.  The Phase I and II efforts will be coordinated with internal R&amp;D efforts of DOS and Moore Tool Co.  rnrnThe object of a Phase III proposal will be to integrate an air bearing spindle in a 3 meter capacity diamond turning machine that will have a load capacity of approximately 89,000 Newton (20,000 lb.) and a rotational speed capability of 1000 rpm.rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
