    a mix of great egrets and great blue herons. The great egrets outnumbered the great
    blue herons by at least two to one. We estimated there were >150 great egret nests
    and >75 great blue heron nests. This is probably a conservative estimate of the
    colony size, but the proportion of birds is probably accurate. Attempts to determine
    the number or percent of active nests in the colony were not successful. Distinguishing
    great blue heron nests from great egret nests was not possible once we entered the
    colony and birds took to flight. Aerial photos and aerial observations of the colony
    provided less than optimal data on the numbers of active nests. The Conoho Creek
    colony was comprised of about 40 great blue heron nests. About 90% of the nests
    were active. Eggs were sampled from seven nests in three different trees at Conine
    Creek and 10 nests in three trees at Conoho Creek. Initially it was difficult to
    select active nests from the ground as the adult birds left the area when the colony
    was entered. However, closer inspection revealed that active nests looked fuller.
    Once the trees were climbed it was easy to distinguish great blue heron eggs from
    those of great egrets by the larger size of great blue heron eggs and nests. The
    number of eggs per active nest ranged from 2 to 5 with an average of 3.76 eggs per
    nest. Hatching dates were more synchronized in the Conoho Creek colony than the
    Conine Colony (Table 1, Figure 3). Two separate visits to the sites were therefore
    necessary to count hatchlings. Nesting histories are summarized in Table 2 and Figure
    4. Of the 11 nests that hatched one or more young, hatching success was 82.9% (29
    eggs/35 eggs). Assuming no-additional fledgling mortality after our final visit
    to the colonies, we estimate that 29 young were produced from 14 nests followed
    through hatching or nest failure (predation or nest missing). Thus production per
    nest averaged 2.07 young. We observed no gross embryonic abnormalities in the sampled
    eggs. Eggshell thickness averaged 0.403 mm between colonies; colony differences
    were not apparent (Table 3). The Ratcliffe Index for both colonies was 1.98 (Table
    4). As expected, eggshell thickness is correlated (r=0.84) with the Ratcliffe Index
    (Figure 5). Although we had originally intended to conduct additional post-hatching
    visits to estimate hatchling survival and fledging success, we finally decided against
    this option. We developed concern that entrance into the colony just before fledging
    might cause early fledging and thus lower fledgling survival. Henny (pers. comm.)
    suggested climbing neighboring trees to observe our sample nests, but this was not
    practical. We attempted aerial estimates of the number of young in our sample nests
    (recognizable by the nest markers placed near the nests), but found it impossible.",nt"owner_org":
