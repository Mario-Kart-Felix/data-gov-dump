    1 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of the south shore of St. John, US
    Virgin Islands. Due to the large file size of the St. John project area, it was
    divided into four component grids for improved manageability, named STJ_1m_grid1,
    STJ_1m_grid2, STJ_1m_grid3, and STJ_1m_grid4 from west to east. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA
    Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel, in collaboration with NOAA vessel
    Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam
    bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired
    with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed
    by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied
    (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using
    final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84.
    The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath
    angle with footprint size 3*3. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface
    and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool
    'Feature to Raster', with cell size 1, was used to generate the final ESRI Grid.
    While the project was conducted to meet IHO Order 2 accuracy standards, there is
    a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in the dataset that the user should take into
    consideration when performing any analysis.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
