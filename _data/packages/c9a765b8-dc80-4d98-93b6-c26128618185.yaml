    complete and document the calibrated spectral intensity of a hydrogen flame, understand
    the role of atmospheric attenuation on the performance of hydrogen flame detectors,
    help qualify the performance of the near infrared water measurement instrument used
    in the NASA Regolith and Environment Science and Oxygen and Lunar Volatile Extraction
    (RESOLVE) project, and build a prototype next-generation ultraviolet hydrogen flame
    simulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We obtained a calibrated ultraviolet lamp
    and worked with safety to permit its use.&amp;nbsp; Using this we were able to calibrate
    our spectrometer for ultraviolet measurements and successfully measured the UV emission
    of a hydrogen flame. This completed our spectral measurement (we had previously
    performed measurements from the visible through the far-infrared under program funding).
    We have documented this effort in a new technology report and in a manuscript that
    we submitted to the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy.&amp;nbsp; This paper
    has been accepted for publication and appeared in the June 2014 issue of the International
    Journal of Hydrogen Energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We set up an extended tube and filled
    it with humid air in order to perform some atmospheric absorption measurements.&amp;nbsp;
    The results have indicated that the new infrared radiation (IR)&amp;nbsp;fire detectors
    should operate within their design distance even in humid Florida air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We
    have provided significant aid to the Resolve project.&amp;nbsp; We took preliminary
    data before the spectrometer showed up, we performed analysis, we helped interpret
    the data provided by their spectrometer, and we&amp;rsquo;ve helped to develop an
    algorithm to convert their spectral absorbance data into a water vapor concentration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We
    have designed, constructed, and tested a new prototype ultraviolet hydrogen flame
    simulator. A new technology report&amp;nbsp;has been&amp;nbsp;written and we will
    be working with KSC Ground Support Development to start the conversion of this device
    into ground support equipment so that it can be used to certify the ultraviolet
    fire detectors still being used in the field.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
