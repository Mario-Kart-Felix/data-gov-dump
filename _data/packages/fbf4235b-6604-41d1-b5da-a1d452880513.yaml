    from measurements made on submerged or drowned coral reef sequence. The core samples
    used have been described elsewhere (cf. Fairbanks, 1989; Guilderson et al., 1994).
    Measurements were made on three different species of corals: the reef-crest Acropora
    palmata and the mixed or buttress zone species Montastrea annularis and Porites
    asteroides. Linear growth rates of individual corals were determined by using the
    low density to high-density band distance as an approximate annual chronometer.
    To minimize growth-rate kinetic induced effects, we only analyzed specimens with
    similar linear growth rates and from the same relative position within the corals.
    Typical linear extension rates were 5mm/year for all specimens analyzed and ranged
    from 3 to 7 mm/year. Two to four parallel transects encompassing 4-8 years per transect
    were extracted using a micro dental drill along the main vertical growth axis. To
    minimize the potential for skeletal inhomogeneities, we attempted to only sample
    theca (walls), except for the P. asteroides specimens whose skeletal architecture
    is too fine for theca sampling. A. palmata specimens were only sampled along the
    upper growing surface as deduced from the skeletal architecture observed in x-radiographs.
    We used x-ray diffraction analysis of drilled and ground specimens to confirm that
    the aragonite was pristine as indicated by the absence of any calcite peaks (detection
    limit 0.5 weight percent). The sampling protocol did not convert aragonite to calcite.
    Living specimens collected over the last ~20 years were treated in a similar fashion
    to the offshore cores. Samples (100-200&oacute;g) were reacted at 90&oacute;C in
    a Carousel-48 device and analyzed on a Finnigan MAT 251 isotope ratio mass spectrometer.
    Calibration is through secondary standards calibrated via NBS (now NIST SRM) standards
    16, 17, 19, and 20. Analytical precision of concurrently analyzed standards is better
    than &oacute;0.05" (1-sigma) for both oxygen and carbon. Data is reported in d-notation
    relative to Pee Dee Belemnite using the defined values of NBS-20 (d18O -4.14" PDB,
    d13C -1.06" PDB). We have not corrected the absolute values of our results for
    the "acid-alpha" difference between aragonite (samples) and calcite (standards).
    Radiocarbon and 230Th/234U chronological control is provided by previously reported
    radiocarbon and Th/U TIMS measurements (Fairbanks 1989; 1990; Bard et al., 1993),
    supplemented by additional measurements (Fairbanks et al., in prep.). The majority
    of samples through the deglaciation have been dated with both techniques. M. annularis
    specimens older than 15.7 14C kyrs have yet to be Th/U dated. Absolute ages for
    these specimens are interpolated using a least squares regression through the appropriate
    coral data (Fairbanks et al., in prep.). Ice volume residual Dd18O is calculated
    in a similar fashion to Guilderson et al., (1994). In specimens older than the last
    glacial maximum as determined by the A. palmata Barbados sea level record, the residual
    is calculated using an ice volume component of 1.1".",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
