	"notes": "&lt;p&gt;rnt&amp;quot;Three factors characterize an X-ray optics fabrication technology: angular resolution, effective area per unit mass, and production cost per unit effective area. In general, these three factors are always in conflict with one another. Every telescope that has flown so far represents an astronomically useful compromise of these factors. Of three operating X-ray telescopes, Chandra has been optimized for angular resolution (0.5 arcsecs); Suzaku for effective area per unit mass; and both were optimized in its own way to minimize production cost. We propose an X-ray mirror fabrication method that, when validated and developed, will enable the making of mirror segments with Chandra&amp;#39;s angular resolution but with Suzaku&amp;#39;s mass per unit area. This method, utilizing an industrial material and commercial polishing techniques, is fast and inexpensive and will enable both small and large X-ray astronomical missions. The method is based on two recent developments. First, revolutionary optical polishing technologies have been developed since the fabrication of the Chandra mirrors. Second, large blocks of mono-crystalline silicon have become readily and inexpensively available. Taking advantage of the grazing incidence geometry of X-ray optics, the new polishing technologies can create mirror segments of high angular resolution on thick silicon blocks fast and at low cost. Given the extremely low internal stress of the nearly perfectly crystalline silicon, these mirrors can then be lightweighted (or sliced off from the silicon block) and still maintain their angular resolution. Instead of the traditional approach of &amp;quot;&amp;quot;lightweight and then polish,&amp;quot;&amp;quot; this method reverses the two steps to &amp;quot;&amp;quot;polish first and then lightweight.&amp;quot;&amp;quot; We propose to empirically validate and develop this method in three years. In the first year (FY12) we experiment with making very thin flat mirrors to demonstrate the principle that underpins this method. In the second year (FY13) we extend the experime&lt;/p&gt;rn",

What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
