	"notes": "Advanced Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) radio system is a pivotal technology for the successful support of the International Space Station  beyond 2020 and future human space exploration missions. It facilitates surface operations, enables crew mobility, and supports point to multi-point communications across rovers, Lander, habitat, and other astronauts. Driven by Communications, Command, Control, and Information interoperability, tight power budgets, and extreme miniaturization, this mobile radio platform must be power efficient and highly adaptive. Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) and its sub-contractor, Purdue University, propose to develop a power-efficient, miniaturized, reconfigurable EVA radio system using state-of-the-art RF micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and software defined radio (SDR) technologies; and middleware with power aware algorithms. Modern FPGA devices are bridging the gap between high speed digital design and digital signal processor (DSP) implementation. The SDR-based architecture allows the radio to support multiple bandwidth, waveforms and energy profiles; even those developed after the mission began, via cognitive middleware. Therefore, it can lower the mission cost by upgrading the EVA radios when needed. The MEMS tunable filters proposed are based on miniaturized evanescent-mode cavities, which are 95&#37; smaller than conventional cavities and are capable of providing very high Q and excellent tuning range.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
