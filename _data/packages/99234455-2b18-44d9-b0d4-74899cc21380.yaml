    simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census Bureau's
    Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing
    (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed for
    small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the
    intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain
    the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas
    may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available
    as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.nnSLDU
    stands for State Legislative District Upper Chamber.  State Legislative Districts
    (SLDs) are the areas from which members are elected to State legislatures. The SLDs
    embody the upper (senate) and lower (house) chambers of the state legislature. Nebraska
    has a unicameral legislature and the District of Columbia has a single council,
    both of which the Census Bureau treats as upper-chamber legislative areas for the
    purpose of data presentation; there are no data by SLDL for either Nebraska or the
    District of Columbia. A unique three-character census code, identified by State
    participants, is assigned to each SLD within a state. In Connecticut, Illinois,
    Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, and Puerto Rico, the
    Redistricting Data Program (RDP) participant did not define the SLDs to cover all
    of the state or state equivalent area. In these areas with no SLDs defined, the
    code "ZZZ" has been assigned, which is treated as a single SLD for purposes of
    data presentation. nnThe boundaries of the 2014 State legislative districts were
    provided by state-level participants through the RDP and reflect the districts used
    to elect members in or prior to the November 2014 election.",nt"license_title":
