    acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of Salt Point map area, California. Backscatter
    data are provided as separate grids depending on mapping system or processing method.
    The raster data files are included in "BackscatterSwath_SaltPoint.zip", which
    are accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreSaltPoint/data_catalog_OffshoreSaltPoint.html.
    The acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of Salt Point map area, California,
    was generated from backscatter data collected by California State University, Monterey
    Bay (CSUMB), and by Fugro Pelagos. Mapping was completed between 2007 and 2010,
    using a combination of 200-kHz and 400-kHz Reson 7125, and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam
    echosounders, as well as 468-kHz SEA SWATHPlus interferometric system. These mapping
    missions combined to collect backscatter data from about the 10-m isobath to beyond
    the 3-nautical-mile limit of California State Waters. Within the acoustic-backscatter
    imagery, brighter tones indicate higher backscatter intensity, and darker tones
    indicate lower backscatter intensity. The intensity represents a complex interaction
    between the acoustic pulse and the seafloor, as well as characteristics within the
    shallow subsurface, providing a general indication of seafloor texture and composition.
    Backscatter intensity depends on the acoustic source level; the frequency used to
    image the seafloor; the grazing angle; the composition and character of the seafloor,
    including grain size, water content, bulk density, and seafloor roughness; and some
    biological cover. Harder and rougher bottom types such as rocky outcrops or coarse
    sediment typically return stronger intensities (high backscatter, lighter tones),
    whereas softer bottom types such as fine sediment return weaker intensities (low
    backscatter, darker tones). These data are not intended for navigational purposes.",nt"license_title":
