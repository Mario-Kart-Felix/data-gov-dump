	"notes": "A compact, low-power GN&amp;amp;C system is essential to the success ofnpico-satellite Automated Rendezvous and Docking (AR&amp;amp;D).  AustinnSatellite Design (ASD) proposes to deliver a working design of annintegrated six-degree-of-freedom (DOF) Guidance, Navigation, and Controln(GN&amp;amp;C) system for pico-satellites at the conclusion of Phase 1 ofnthis STTR.  A six DOF translation and rotation determination and controlnsystem will be designed for a pico-satellite form-factor to generate thenonboard guidance and control necessary to demonstrate autonomous controlnstability and perform simple proximity maneuvers.  An existing NASA/JSCnGPS receiver will be utilized for navigation.  Added sensors, such as anmagnetometer, will be combined with GPS signals for attitudendetermination.  A thruster actuator concept will be identified and andesign produced that satisfies anticipated operational requirements andnthat fits within the mass and power constraints of the pico-satellitenmission.  Flight hardware will not be procured until Phase 2; however,ncomponent characteristics will be documented and modeled during Phase 1nand GN&amp;amp;C algorithms will be written to include them.  Software thatncan be deployed to embedded systems will be written and validated innsimulation.  At the conclusion of Phase 1, simulated GN&amp;amp;C will bendemonstrated within a pico-satellite form factor using embedded softwarensuch that a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 is achieved.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
