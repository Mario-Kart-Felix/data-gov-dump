	"notes": "The focus of MMAMA is on providing high-fidelity scientific investigations, scientific input, and science operations constraints in the context of planetary field campaigns. Funding provided in this program element is intended to enable researchers to conduct scientific investigations and integrate their instruments, projects, and/or protocols into field activities designed to help NASA plan for future exploration of the Moon, Mars, and other planetary bodies with both robots and humans. The MMAMA R&amp;A Lead estimates that approximately two-thirds of the effort funded through MMAMA is technology-related.  nnThrough this research program element, investigators are selected to carry out specific scientific research analogous to investigations anticipated for missions to asteroids, the Moon, and/or Mars. Areas of specific interest to the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) include, but are not limited to:n1. Understanding and optimizing human and robotic performance to maximize scientific return;n2. Defining science requirements for human missions, including requirements for mobility, navigation, communications, in situ analysis, surface laboratory functionality, crew scheduling, and sample acquisition, handling, documentation, and curation;n3. Developing surface science scenarios for use in architecture planning and science payload manifesting; andn4. Illuminating areas of critical importance for robotic precursor missions, including robotic operations of/with human-oriented systems during periods when humans may not yet be present.n5. Field testing of robotic, teleoperated, and human-operated instruments.nnAlthough this is primarily a Planetary Sciences call, proposals in other areas of SMD research such as Heliophysics, Astrophysics, and Earth Science are considered, to the extent that they reflect NASA?s strategic scientific goals at asteroids, the Moon, and/or Mars.nn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
