    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Executive Summary: Artificial intelligence
    (AI) is a transformative technology that holds promise for tremendous societal and
    economic benefit. AI has the potential to revolutionize how we live, work, learn,
    discover, and communicate. AI research can further our national priorities, including
    increased economic prosperity, improved educational opportunities and quality of
    life, and enhanced national and homeland security. Because of these potential benefits,
    the U.S. government has invested in AI research for many years. Yet, as with any
    significant technology in which the Federal government has interest, there are not
    only tremendous opportunities but also a number of considerations that must be taken
    into account in guiding the overall direction of Federally-funded R&D in AI. On
    May 3, 2016,the Administration announced the formation of a new NSTC Subcommittee
    on Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence, to help coordinate Federal activity
    in AI.1 This Subcommittee, on June 15, 2016, directed the Subcommittee on Networking
    and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) to create a National
    Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan. A NITRD Task Force
    on Artificial Intelligence was then formed to define the Federal strategic priorities
    for AI R&D, with particular attention on areas that industry is unlikely to address.
    This National Artificial Intelligence R&D Strategic Plan establishes a set of objectives
    for Federallyfunded AI research, both research occurring within the government as
    well as Federally-funded research occurring outside of government, such as in academia.
    The ultimate goal of this research is to produce new AI knowledge and technologies
    that provide a range of positive benefits to society, while minimizing the negative
    impacts. To achieve this goal, this AI R&D Strategic Plan identifies the following
    priorities for Federally-funded AI research: Strategy 1: Make long-term investments
    in AI research. Prioritize investments in the next generation of AI that will drive
    discovery and insight and enable the United States to remain a world leader in AI.
    Strategy 2: Develop effective methods for human-AI collaboration. Rather than replace
    humans, most AI systems will collaborate with humans to achieve optimal performance.
    Research is needed to create effective interactions between humans and AI systems.
    Strategy 3: Understand and address the ethical, legal, and societal implications
    of AI. We expect AI technologies to behave according to the formal and informal
    norms to which we hold our fellow humans. Research is needed to understand the ethical,
    legal, and social implications of AI, and to develop methods for designing AI systems
    that align with ethical, legal, and societal goals. Strategy 4: Ensure the safety
    and security of AI systems. Before AI systems are in widespread use, assurance is
    needed that the systems will operate safely and securely, in a controlled, well-defined,
    and well-understood manner. Further progress in research is needed to address this
    challenge of creating AI systems that are reliable, dependable, and trustworthy.
    Strategy 5: Develop shared public datasets and environments for AI training and
    testing. The depth, quality, and accuracy of training datasets and resources significantly
    affect AI performance. Researchers need to develop high quality datasets and environments
    and enable responsible access to high-quality datasets as well as to testing and
    training resources. Strategy 6: Measure and evaluate AI technologies through standards
    and benchmarks. . Essential to advancements in AI are standards, benchmarks, testbeds,
    and community engagement that guide and evaluate progress in AI. Additional research
    is needed to develop a broad spectrum of evaluative techniques. Strategy 7: Better
    understand the national AI R&D workforce needs. Advances in AI will require a strong
    community of AI researchers. An improved understanding of current and future R&D
    workforce demands in AI is needed to help ensure that sufficient AI experts are
    available to address the strategic R&D areas outlined in this plan. The AI R&D Strategic
    Plan closes with two recommendations: Recommendation 1: Develop an AI R&D implementation
    framework to identify S&T opportunities and support effective coordination of AI
    R&D investments, consistent with Strategies 1-6 of this plan. Recommendation 2:
    Study the national landscape for creating and sustaining a healthy AI R&D workforce,
    consistent with Strategy 7 of this plan.",nt"license_title": "Other License
