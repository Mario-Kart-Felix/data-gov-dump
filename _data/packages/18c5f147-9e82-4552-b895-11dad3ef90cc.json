	"notes": "The photographs in the Adopt a Pixel collection were provided by volunteers with a digital camera, a Global Positioning System (GPS), and a compass or a smart mobile device with those three capabilities. A simple, straightforward protocol for collection of scientifically useful ground reference data was developed and field tested in spring and summer 2013. The Landsat Science Team provided input on the protocol to ensure its scientific utility. The Adopt a Pixel collection continues to grow with the help from citizen scientists from across the globe. Volunteers can share their land cover photographs and participate in the program by visiting the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center Adopt a Pixel interface (https://adoptapixel.cr.usgs.gov). Images show the terrain from a single point facing North, South, East, West, Up, and Down to give a clear view of landscape features in all directions. Field observations include land cover classification and any notable comments about conditions, patterns or changes.",
