	"notes": "This data set provides estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB) for defined land cover types within World Wildlife Fund (WWF) ecoregions across the boreal biome of Alaska and western and eastern Canada, roughly between 45 and 70 degrees N. The study focused on within-growing-season data, i.e. leaf-on conditions.The AGB estimates were derived from a series of models that first related ground-based measured biomass to Portable Airborne Laser System (PALS) LiDAR measurements, and a second set of models that related the airborne estimates of biomass to Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) LiDAR canopy structure measurements. The GLAS LiDAR biomass estimates were extrapolated by land cover types and ecoregions across the entire biome area.The study compiled remotely sensed forest structure data collected in June of 2005 and 2006 from the GLAS LiDAR instrument aboard the NASA Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation (ICESat) satellite and from the PALS airborne instrument flown at various times from 2005-2009 over both the ground plots and the ICESat GLAS flight path. For a consistent biome-level analysis, ecoregions contained within the boreal forest biome were identified by the World Wildlife Fund's (WWF) ecoregion map of the world (Olson et al., 2001). Land cover maps were used to identify land cover types for stratification purposes within eco-regions. Land cover data for Canada were provided by the Earth Observations for Sustainable Development (EOSD) project centered on year 2000, with images from 1999 to 2002. The National Land Cover Data (NLCD) 2001 classification was used for Alaska based on data collected between 1999 and 2004. The ground-based measurements are not provided with this data set.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
