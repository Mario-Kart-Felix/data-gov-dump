    related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographicn
             information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically
    Integratedn          Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).
    The MTDB represents an          seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps
    between parts, however, each TIGER/Linen          shapefile is designed to stand
    alone as an independent data set, or they can be combinedn          to cover the
    entire nation. State Legislative Districts (SLDs) are the areas from whichn          members
    are elected to State legislatures. The SLDs embody the upper (senate) and lowern
             (house) chambers of the State legislature. Nebraska has a unicameral legislature
    and then          District of Columbia has a single council, both of which the Census
    Bureau treats asn          upper-chamber legislative areas for the purpose of data
    presentation; there are no data byn          SLDL for either Nebraska or the District
    of Columbia. A unique three-character censusn          code, identified by State
    participants, is assigned to each SLD within a State. Inn          Connecticut,
    Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, andn          Puerto
    Rico, the Redistricting Data Program (RDP) participant did not define the SLDs ton
             cover all of the State or State equivalent area. In these areas with no
    SLDs defined, then          code "ZZZ" has been assigned, which is treated as
    a single SLD for purposes of datan          presentation. The boundaries of the
    2012 State legislative districts were provided byn          State-level participants
    through the RDP and reflect the districts used to elect membersn          in or
    prior to the November 2012 election.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
