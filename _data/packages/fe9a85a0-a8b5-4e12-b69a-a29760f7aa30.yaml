    is conducting a study on the effects of climate change on ocean acidification within
    the Gulf of Mexico; dealing specifically with the effect of ocean acidification
    on marine organisms and habitats. To investigate this, the USGS participated in
    two cruises in the West Florida Shelf and northern Gulf of Mexico regions aboard
    the R/V Weatherbird II, a ship of opportunity lead by Dr. Kendra Daly, of the University
    of South Florida (USF). The cruises occurred September 20 - 28 and November 2 -
    4, 2011. Both left from and returned to Saint Petersburg, Florida, but followed
    different routes (see Trackline). On both cruises the USGS collected data pertaining
    to pH, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and total alkalinity in discrete samples.
    Discrete surface samples were taken during transit approximatly hourly on both cruises,
    95 in September were collected over a span of 2127 km, and 7 over a trackline of
    732 km line on the November cruise. Along with the surface samples, another set
    of samples were taken at various depths at stations; 27 in September at four stations
    and 15 in November at five stations. In addition to the discrete samples flow-through
    data was also collected on both cruises in a variety of forms. Surface CTD data
    was collected every five minutes which includes temperature, salinity, and pH. In
    addition, two more flow-through instruments were setup on both cruises that recorded
    pH and CO2 every 15 minutes. Corroborating the USGS data is the vertical CTD profiles
    collected by USF, using the following sensors: CTD, oxygen, chlorophyll fluorescence,
    optical backscatter, and transmissometer. Additionally, discrete depth samples for
    nutrients, chlorophyll, and particulate organic carbon/nitrogen were collected.",nt"license_title":
