    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The Atlas Mill Tailings Pile is located
    adjacent to the Upper Colorado River near Moab, Utah. Milling of ore ceased in 1984
    and the Atlas Corporation subsequently declared bankruptcy. The U.S. Department
    of Energy (USDOE) is the current manager of the site and is evaluating cleanup options
    that include remediation of groundwater at the site. This reach of the Upper Colorado
    River was declared as critical habitat for two endangered fish species (Colorado
    pikeminnow, Ptychocheilus lucius and razorback sucker, Xyrauchen texanus) by the
    U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) because it is one of the few existing areas
    that contains known spawning and rearing habitats for these fishes. Monitoring data
    indicates that the groundwater entering the Upper Colorado River is contaminated
    with ammonia, metals, and radio-chemicals. The USFWS is concerned that contaminated
    groundwater from the Atlas Mill Tailings Pile may be impacting endangered fish populations
    within this critical habitat. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducted a site-specific
    risk assessment to determine if groundwater entering the Upper Colorado River from
    beneath the tailings pile could impact populations of the endangered Colorado pikeminnow
    and razorback sucker. Spatial mapping of contaminant plumes in the river was conducted
    over several hydrologic regimes and seasons from August 1998 to August 2000. Laboratory
    and field toxicity tests were conducted with Colorado pikeminnow, razorback sucker,
    and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) to determine their sensitivity to ammonia
    and site waters. The effects of contaminated groundwater on macroinvertebrate communities
    were also assessed. Results indicated that the Atlas Mill Tailings Pile represents
    a localized source of groundwater input containing elevated levels of ammonia, metals,
    and radio-chemicals that exceed Utah state water quality criteria during the low-water
    hydrologic period ranging from August to March. Toxicity testing indicated that
    Colorado pikeminnow, razorback sucker, and fathead minnow were of similar sensitivity
    to ammonia with 28-d LOEC values for mortality ranging from 2.19 to 4.35 mg/L total
    ammonia at pH=8.25 and temperature =25 C (0.14 to 0.31 mg/L unionized ammonia).
    Mortality and growth endpoints were similar in sensitivity to ammonia for the three
    species. On-site toxicity tests demonstrated that site waters were directly toxic
    to both the endangered Colorado pikeminnow as well as the standard surrogate fathead
    minnow. Highest observed field concentrations caused instantaneous mortality in
    both controlled laboratory and in-situ field studies. Comparisons of laboratory
    and field results indicate that ammonia is the primary contaminant of concern due
    to high exposures and the rapid onset of toxicity. Metals and radio-chemicals, although
    sometimes elevated above criteria, did not contribute to toxicity. There were no
    statistically significant differences in macroinvertebrate distributions that could
    be attributed to contaminated groundwater. Collectively, the data indicate that
    the Atlas Mill Tailings Pile represents a localized input of contaminated groundwater
    that threatens endangered fish species in the area. The current Utah state water
    quality criteria for total ammonia is 0.71 mg/L (assuming average conditions of
    pH=8.25 and temperature =25 C), or approximately 0.06 mg/L unionized ammonia. The
    Utah state water quality criteria for ammonia, if met, would be protective of Colorado
    pikeminnow and razorback sucker by a factor of at least 2 based on conservative
    toxicity endpoints. Therefore, remediation of groundwater entering the Colorado
    River to meet existing Utah state water quality criteria for ammonia would eliminate
    toxicological concerns for Colorado pikeminnow and razorback sucker.",nt"license_title":
