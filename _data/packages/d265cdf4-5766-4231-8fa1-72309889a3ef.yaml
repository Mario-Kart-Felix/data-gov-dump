    the approximate location of tax parcels contained in County Assessor tax rolls.
    Individual county data was integrated into this statewide publication by the Arkansas
    Geographic Information Office (AGIO). The Computer Aided Mass Appraisal (CAMA) systems
    maintained in each county are used to populate the database attributes for each
    centroid feature. The entity attribute structure conforms to the Arkansas Cadastral
    Mapping Standard. The digital cadastral data is provided as a publication version
    that only represents a snapshot of the production data at the time it was received
    from the county. Published updates may be made to counties throughout the year.
    These will occur after new data is digitized or updates to existing data are finished.
    Production versions of the data exist in the various counties where daily and weekly
    updates occur. Users should consult the BEGIN_DATE attribute column to determine
    the age of the data for a given county. This column reflects the date when AGIO
    received the data from the county. Only parcels with an associated Computer Assisted
    Mass Appraisal (CAMA) record are provided. This means a CAMA record may exist, but
    no point geometry or vice-versa. Cadastral data is dynamic by its nature; therefore
    it is impossible for any county to ever be considered complete. The data is NOT
    topologically enforced. As a statewide integrator, AGIO publishes the data but does
    not make judgment calls about where points or polygon lines are meant to be located.
    Therefore each county data set is published without topology rules being enforced.
    GIS Technicians use best practices such as polygon closure and vertex snapping,
    however, topology is not built for each county. Users should be aware, by Arkansas
    Law (15-21-504 2 B) digital cadastral data does not represent legal property boundary
    descriptions, nor is it suitable for boundary determination of the individual parcels
    included in the cadastre. Users requiring a boundary determination should consult
    an Arkansas Registered Land Surveyor (http://www.arkansas.gov/pels/search/search.php)
    on boundary questions. The digital cadastral data is intended to be a graphical
    representation of the tax parcel only. Just because a county is listed does NOT
    imply the data represents county wide coverage. AGIO worked with each county to
    determine a level of production that warranted the data was ready to be published.
    For example, in some counties only the north part of the county was covered or in
    other cases only rural parcels are covered and yet in others only urban parcels.
    The approach is to begin incremental publishing as production blocks are ready,
    even though a county may not have county wide coverage. Each case represents a significant
    amount of data that will be useful immediately. Users should consult the BEGIN_DATE
    attribute column to determine the age of the data for a given county. This date
    reflects when the data was received from the county. Digital cadastral data users
    should be aware the County Assessor Mapping Program adopted a phased approach for
    developing cadastral data. Phase One includes the production of a parcel centroid
    for each parcel that bears the attributes prescribed by the state cadastral mapping
    standard. Phase Two includes the production of parcel polygon geometry and bears
    the standard attributes. The Arkansas standard closely mirrors the federal Cadastral
    Core Data Standard established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee, Subcommittee
    for Cadastral Data. Counties within this file include: Arkansas, Ashley, Baxter,
    Boone, Carroll, Chicot, Clark, Clay, Columbia, Conway, Craighead, Crawford, Cross,
