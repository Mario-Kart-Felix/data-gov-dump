	"notes": "MetroSim is a Metroplex-based arrival, departure, and surface optimization.  Linking with both the NASA-developed Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) tool as well as the NASA-developed System Oriented Runway Management (SORM) tool, MetroSim allows airport planners, traffic flow management experts, airline dispatchers, air traffic controllers, and pilots to reduce the uncertainty in operations planning, recover quickly from disruptive events, maintain high throughput even in adverse weather conditions, and handle the uncertainties associated with weather forecasts. To accomplish all these goals simultaneously, the MetroSim architecture contains a collection of different tools, some of which are simulations, some of which are physics-based computations, and some of which are mathematical optimization calculations.  These tools all interoperate in a distributed computational environment to provide real-time airport planning and optimization at the Metroplex level for all operations&amp;#151;arrivals, departures, and surface movements.  The type of each tool is chosen to be the best and fastest at what it is required to compute.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
