  system designs are becoming increasinglyrnsophisticated and complex. Determining
  the health state of these systems using traditional methods is becoming more difficult
  as the number of sensors and component interactions grows. Data-driven monitoring
  techniques have been developed to address these issues byrnanalyzing system operations
  data to automatically characterize normal system behavior. The Inductive Monitoring
  System is a data-driven system health monitoring software tool that has been successfully
  applied to several aerospace applications. Inductive Monitoring System uses a data
  mining technique called clustering to analyze archived system data and characterizernnormal
  interactions between parameters. This characterization, or model, of nominal operation
  is stored in a knowledge base that can be used for real-time system monitoring orrnfor
  analysis of archived events. Ongoing and developing Inductive Monitoring System
  space operations applications include International Space Station flight control,
  spacecraft vehiclernsystem health management, launch vehicle ground operations,
  and fleet supportability. As a common thread of discussion this paper will employ
  the evolution of the Inductive MonitoringrnSystem data-driven technique as related
  to several Integrated Systems Health Management elements. Thematically, the projects
  listed will be used as case studies. The maturation of Inductive Monitoring System
  via projects where it has been deployed or is currently beingrnintegrated to aid
  in fault detection will be described. The paper will also explain how Inductive
  Monitoring System can be used to complement a suite of other Integrated System Health
  Management tools, providing initial fault detection support for diagnosis and recovery.\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
