		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

	"notes": "Core noise will become a larger component of engine noise overall, as more efficient design trends of fan and jet noise reduction technologies are implemented. The necessity to keep weight and material costs low, as well as the complex geometry and high temperatures involved with the combustion region, make the production of acoustic liners a difficult task.  CRG will develop and produce a prototype acoustic liner test sample for the combustion region that will address all of these issues.  CRG will use its Sialyte(TM) material and simple manufacturing processes to produce a lightweight, inexpensive liner, that contains inherent high-temperature resistant properties.  Sialyte(TM) is a low-cost material system developed for use in high-temperature and high-pressure applications.  CRG will tailor Sialyte(TM) liner properties to demonstrate fabrication control of Sialyte(TM) open-cell foams or combination with Sialyte(TM) honeycomb. These materials will provide broadband acoustic attenuation in relevant frequency ranges, as well as tailoring material properties for mechanical and thermal performance requirements.  The Sialyte(TM) liner will conform to complex, curved geometries and will withstand the high temperatures and stresses in the combustion region.  CRG will demonstrate performance of TRL 4 in Phase I.",
