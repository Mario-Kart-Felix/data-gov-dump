	"notes": "This model product provides the Fortran source code and input data for the Simple Tropical Ecosystem Model (SITE). SITE is a simplified point model of vegetation dynamics that uses an integration interval of one hour to estimate the fluxes of CO2, water, and energy. Model forcing data are hourly meteorological parameters. SITE is a simplified model of vegetation dynamics for tropical ecosystems developed by Santos and Costa (2004).Model input data measurements of temperature, wind velocity, precipitation, latent heat, sensible heat, downward incident solar flux, and downward incident infrared flux were collected at the km 67 Tapajos National Forest site, Para, Brazil, from 2002 to 2003.SITE is structured with a canopy layer and two soil layers, and incorporates the following processes:*infrared radiation balance in the canopy and balance of solar radiation*aerodynamic processes*plant physiology*transpiration*balance of water intercepted by the canopy*transport of mass and energy fluxes*soil heat flux and soil moisture*carbon balance There are five files provided with this data set: the Fortran source code (version 1.1-0d), one file for the main program that declares variables and input parameters, one file that initializes vegetation parameters, one file used to compile the SITE model, and the km 67 input data file in comma-delimited (.csv) format. The four SITE files are provided in the compressed file SITE_Model.zip.  One companion file is also provided that  describes the collection and processing of the meteorological and flux measurements at the km 67 Tapajos National Forest site and the use of the data to calibrate SITE.

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
