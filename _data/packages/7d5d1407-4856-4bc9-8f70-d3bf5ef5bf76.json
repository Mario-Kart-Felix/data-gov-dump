	"notes": "The availability of an air vehicle to perform missions or generate sorties is negatively impacted by time spent on the ground due to scheduled servicing and maintenance. Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) helps maximize the availability of air assets by servicing the air vehicle based on actual condition as opposed to a fixed number of operating hours. Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) enables improved CBM on air vehicles by comparing in-situ sensor data to prognostic models of components and subsystems to predict wear as it occurs. Integration of these PHM systems with an autonomic logistics infrastructure can lead to even greater increases in sortie generation rates and decreases in maintenance cost and logistics burden by eliminating unnecessary preventative maintenance as well as identifying failures occurring outside the normal scheduled maintenance cycle. Aurora's innovative approach utilizes information from existing sensors (i.e., does not require additional sensors added to the vehicle, hence, 'sensor-free') to determine PHM.rnCurrent implementation of PHM is focused on new designs of manned aircraft to allow co-development of the PHM system and its specific sensors. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have sensors and subsystems already installed that can provide the capability for a PHM retrofit on in-fleet systems. UAV specific subsystems, such as the autopilot, also provide the opportunity for new PHM capabilities beyond those considered in manned aircraft.rnrnAurora proposes the Integrated Vehicle Health Management System (IVHMS). Aurora's IVHMS will compare models of the aircraft in different configurations to an estimate of the current state of the aircraft in order to generate a better understanding of the real-time operating condition of the vehicle and its constituent components. The IVHMS uses these capabilities to generate a vehicle-wide identification of systems in order to detect faults as they influence overall performance.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
