    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Background:The Biological Monitoring Program
    is a part of the Western Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation
    Plan (MSHCP), which was permitted in June, 2004. The Monitoring Program monitors
    the status of 146 Covered Species within a designated Conservation Area to provide
    information to permittees, land managers, the public, and wildlife agencies (i.e.,
    the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service).
    Monitoring Program activities are guided by MSHCP species objectives for each covered
    species, the information needs identified in Section 5.3 of the MSHCP (http://www.rctlma.org/mshcp/volume1/sec5.html#5.3)
    or elsewhere in the document, and the information needs of the permittees. The Biological
    Monitoring Program seeks to provide sufficient scientifically reliable data to assess
    the MSHCP's effectiveness at meeting resource objectives and achieving or maintaining
    a healthy MSHCP Conservation Area in perpetuity. This dataset includes all records
    of animal species that were acquired during formal surveys for MSHCP-Covered Species
    conducted by the Biological Monitoring Program within the MSHCP Conservation Area
    between 2005-2014.Purpose:This dataset is intended for distribution to BIOS and
    all users of this database as documentation of species presence at a specific place
    and time. These data are useful for modeling species-habitat associations, documenting
    species distributions, and any other presence-only data applications.Data assumptions
    and limitations:We assumed that all observers were equally capable of confirming
    all target species for each taxa-specific survey activity after completing training
    exercises and passing any required species-identification tests. If known, surveys
    were conducted within the optimal range of dates, times, and weather conditions
    to maximize target species detection probability. These data have all been proofed
    after entry and are now assumed to be free from data entry error. However, if an
    observer recorded data incorrectly in the field it is possible that those errors
    persist in this dataset. This is a presence-only dataset. Because the lack of recorded
    species observations in a given area may be the result of a lack of surveys in that
    area or the failure to detect a species during a survey when it is actually present,
    true absence is not implied by this dataset and should not be inferred.Known caveats
    of the data:The Accuracy field describes the maximum potential amount of error in
    the geographic coordinates associated with each observation record. The magnitude
    of potential error for any observation is the result of survey protocol decisions
    made to increase data collection efficiency and vary across taxa.Some observation
    records were omitted from this dataset because an accurate identification could
    not be made to the species, subspecies, or variety level. Others were omitted because
    their coordinates fell beyond 30 meters of the September 2014 Conservation Area
    boundary.Observations of humans recorded in camera station photographs were also
    omitted. If users of this dataset are interested in these observations, please contact
    the Biological Monitoring Program.Supplemental Information:Because many survey protocols
    involve gathering data for a specified period of time at a single location, and
    because survey locations are often repeatedly visited in a given year, many observation
    locations have multiple observations of the same species or of different species.
    Additional information and data collected during these surveys (e.g., notes made
    in the field, environmental conditions and habitat condition made at the time of
    observation) and about the survey efforts that produced these data are available
    by request from the Monitoring Program and are summarized where relevant in annually
    distributed survey summary reports.Spatial data capture methods: All spatial data
    were either recorded in the field using a hand-held GPS unit, digitized in ArcGIS,
    or generated with specialized computer software. Coordinates obtained by GPS were
    recorded on paper datasheets and entered by hand into the database in the office.
    Data generated by computer software consist of points, straight-lines, or defined-area
    polygons that were used to map and locate sampling stations in the field. Station
    names and coordinates were uploaded digitally into the Biological Monitoring Programu2019s
    central database and joined through station name to results of surveys conducted
    at those locations.",nt"owner_org": "467d900f-8a42-452d-9906-6610dd1a767f",nt"extras":
