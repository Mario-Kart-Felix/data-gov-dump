	"notes": "MicroLink and its subcontractor Magnolia Solar will develop and demonstrate advanced anti-reflection coating (ARC) designs that will provide a better broadband and angular response than that of current coatings.  Advanced coatings of this nature are needed to realize the full potential forthcoming generation of multi-junction solar cells that will contain four or more junctions.  We will undertake several approaches to this problem:rnrn* investigate new dielectric materials that will allow a refractive index intermediate between those of the materials that are currently in common use as ARCs; rn* investigate a dielectric codeposition processes that will allow the fabrication of materials with a wide range of refractive indices; and rn* investigate oxidation of Al-containing III-V semiconductor compounds as a mechanism for forming a more transparent window layer.  rnrnBased on the results of these investigations, we will fabricate and test on III-V triple-junction solar cells the best-identified candidates for improved anti-reflection coating.  If successful, the new coating designs will have a reflectance less than 5&#37; over the spectral range 300 nm to 1800 nm and over a wide range of incident angles.  The coatings will be completely compatible with inverted metamorphic (IMM) multi-junction solar cell technology and will be optically matched to IMM solar cells.  We expect the new coatings will enable a relative efficiency increase of at least 7&#37;, corresponding to a 2.5&#37; absolute efficiency increase.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
