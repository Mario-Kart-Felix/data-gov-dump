  Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
  reef ecosystems, from 12-13, 20 March 2010, belt transect surveys of coral population
  and diseases quantitative assessments were conducted, as a part of Rapid Ecological
  Assessments (REA), during the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP)
  Cruise HI1001 in American Samoa at biennial intervals by the Coral Reef Ecosystem
  Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). During
  the cruise, there were 9 surveys in total conducted at REA sites around Ta'u Island
  in American Samoa. At the specific REA sites, coral biologists along with algal
  biologists and marine invertebrate zoologist entered the water and conducted a fine-scale
  (~300 m2) and high degree of taxonomic resolution REA survey to assess and monitor
  species composition, abundance, percent cover, size distribution, diversity, and
  general health of corals, macro-invertebrates, and algae in shallow-water (< 35
  m) habitats. As a part of REA surveys, the coral belt surveys were focused on quantifying
  the diversity, abundance, density, and size-class distribution of the anthozoan
  and hydrozoan corals as well as the condition and health state of the coral reef
  populations. The surveys were conducted along two consecutively-placed, 25m transect
  lines. The belt width was 1-m wide, 0.5-m on each side of the transect line. Within
  each 25m transect, five 2.5-meter segments were surveyed (beginning at points: 0,
  5, 10, 15, and 20 meters), whereby in each segment, all coral colonies whose center
  fell within 0.5m of either side of the transect line were identified to the lowest
  taxonomic level possible (genus or species) and two planar size metrics were collected:
  maximum diameter and diameter perpendicular to the maximum diameter. In addition,
  the extent of mortality, both recent and old, was estimated for each colony. Observers
  paid special attention to identifying as best as possible the extent of the former
  live colony. When a coral colony exhibited signs of disease or compromised health,
  additional information was recorded including type of affliction (bleaching, skeletal
  growth anomaly, white syndrome, tissue loss other than white syndrome, trematodiasis,
  necrosis, other, pigmentation responses, algal overgrowth, and predation), severity
  of the affliction (mild, moderate, marked, severe, acute), as well as photographic
  documentation and sometimes tissue samples. Tissue samples were catalogued and fixed
  in buffered zinc-formalin solution for further histopathological analyses. Raw survey
  data included species presence and relative abundance, colony counts per taxon,
  size (width and length), mortality, predation, and health status. A surveyed area
  was ranging from 10m2 to 25m2 per site.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819\",\n\t\"extras\":
