    KH-9 acquired photographs of the Earth's surface with a telescopic camera system
    and transported the exposed film through the use of recovery capsules. The capsules
    or buckets were de-orbited and retrieved by aircraft while the capsules parachuted
    to earth. The exposed film was developed and the images were analyzed for a range
    of military applications. The KH-7 surveillance system was a high resolution imaging
    system that was operational from July 1963 to June 1967. Approximately 18,000 black-and-white
    images and 230 color images are available from the 38 missions flown during this
    program. Key features for this program were larger area of coverage and improved
    ground resolution. The cameras acquired imagery in continuous lengthwise sweeps
    of the terrain. KH-7 images are 9 inches wide, vary in length from 4 inches to 500
    feet long, and have a resolution of 2 to 4 feet. The KH-9 mapping program was operational
    from March 1973 to October 1980 and was designed to support mapping requirements
    and exact positioning of geographical points for the military. This was accomplished
    by using image overlap for stereo coverage and by using a camera system with a reseau
    grid to correct image distortion. The KH-9 framing cameras produced 9 x 18 inch
    imagery at a resolution of 20-30 feet. Approximately 29,000 mapping images were
    acquired from 12 missions. The images have variable scales and quality. Cloud cover
    is common. The digital products are produced from a duplicate negative film source.
    More than 40 percent of the imagery contains significant cloud cover. The use of
    browse imagery gives the user the opportunity to review a reduced resolution image
    to determine if the area of interest is covered and to check for cloud cover. The
    original film sources are maintained by the (http://www.nara.gov) National Archives
    and Records Administration (NARA).",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
