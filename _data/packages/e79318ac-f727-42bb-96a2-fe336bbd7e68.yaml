  plans for deployment of a vegetable production unit on the International Space Station
  (Veggie) and the procurement and evaluation of platforms (RAZOR) at Kennedy Space
  Center for rapid microbial monitoring on ISS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 3-step approach
  is being used to evaluate and modify methods for analyzing fresh produce (fresh
  vegetables / fruits) that would be compatible with a microgravity environment. Candidate
  food crops are being grown in a controlled environment chamber for the following
  tests:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Assessment of sampling procedures
  for surfaces of edible plant material to gather meaningful microbiological data.
  The three sample methods are surface swabbing, the use of adhesive tape to collect
  surface microbes and a blender method to remove microbes from plant tissue. The
  blender method is the conventional method for food sample processing. The other
  two methods have been tested as portable real-time methods to collect samples from
  the surfaces of meat as well as produce including tomato fruit and leafy greens&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analysis
  of samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), arabidopsis thaliana peroxidases
  (ATP) analysis, and culture based methods for enumeration as well as identification
  of target organisms with an emphasis on approaches that yield rapid results. The
  methods employed are all commercially available technologies. Our goal is to reduce
  detection time with the constraints of methodology that could practically be used
  on the ISS for sample analysis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comparison of sanitizing and
  disinfection procedures for the vegetables and plant growth unit surfaces, including
  methods developed and tested in the AES Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU). The focus
  is on the development of a sanitizing wipe that can be used on plant growth systems
  such as Veggie as well as edible plant surfaces to reduce the microbial load. The
  sanitizer being used is a citric acid based food grade sanitizer (Pro-San&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt;).
  This sanitizer has been tested previously and has been shown to be effective in
  the sanitization of edible vegetables.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A
  series of experiments has been completed using three different sampling procedures,
  swabbing, adhesive tape collection and sample blending for the recovery of bacteria
  from the surface of radish, tomato and lettuce. Data collected and analyzed to date
  show no significant difference using culture based detection methods between the
  adhesive tape and bag blender sample methods in the recovery of &lt;em&gt;Salmonella
  enterica&lt;/em&gt; Typhimurium, a human associated food borne pathogen inoculated
  onto the surface of lettuce, tomato, and radish. The swab method recovery was significantly
  lower then the other two methods in the case of lettuce and radish. With the samples
  collected by these different sampling procedures we are comparing detection and
  quantification methods, specifically real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
  (q-PCR) using two platforms, the LightCycler&amp;reg; (Roche Diagnostics) and a
  rapid portable system, the RAZOR (Biofire, Salt Lake City, UT) with conventional
  culture based methods. For these tests we used &lt;em&gt;S. enterica &lt;/em&gt;Typhimurium
  and &lt;em&gt;Eshcerichia coli&lt;/em&gt; K12 inoculated onto the surface of red
  leaf lettuce and radish. We were able to detect &lt;em&gt;S. enterica&lt;/em&gt;
  from 5/5 samples recovered from radish. This rapid method would eliminate the need
  for plating onto media or DNA extraction followed by real-time quantitative polymerase
  chain reaction&amp;nbsp;(RT-qPCR) shortening detection and enumeration time from
  12-48 hrs to approximately 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two concentrations of sanitizer-saturated
  wipes were tested to lower the microbial counts on radish, tomato and lettuce and
  plastic surfaces similar to the materials that comprise the Veggie plant growth
  system. &amp;nbsp;The sanitizer was effective in lowering the bacterial count by
  90- 99.9&#37; on vegetable surfaces and up to 99.99&#37; on plastic surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
