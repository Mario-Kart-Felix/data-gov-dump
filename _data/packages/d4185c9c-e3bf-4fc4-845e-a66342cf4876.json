	"notes": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Priorities List (NPL) Sites Point Data with CIESIN Modifications, 2008 is a modified version of the 2008 EPA NPL list. It includes all the sites that have been proposed to, currently on, and deleted from the Final NPL as of June 7, 2008. CIESIN has fixed six of the original coordinates by correcting latitude or longitude coordinates and providing the missing coordinates for one site. It contains the point locations, including the seven corrections, for 1,641 U.S. hazardous waste sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) of EPA's Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System (CERCLIS) for the US States and Puerto Rico. The sites in CERCLIS are also known as Superfund Sites. The NPL is intended primarily to guide the EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation. The dataset presented here provides the latitude and longitudinal coordinates of the centroid for each of the 1641 NPL sites. Some of the National Priorities List (NPL) sites have latitude and longitude data accurate to within 30 meters and, in some cases, in the sub-meter range. The latitude and longitude for other sites is the centroid of the ZIP code area for the ZIP code of the site's address. This dataset is modified and distributed by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN). (Suggested Usage: To provide an easily accessible, corrected dataset of the geo-referenced locations for all the National Priorities List sites in the United States and Puerto Rico.)",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
