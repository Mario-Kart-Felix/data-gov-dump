    visits were made to 117 geothermal systems in the Great Basin region. Major field
    excursions, incorporating visits to large groups of systems, were conducted in western

    Nevada, eastern California, southern Oregon, and western Utah. For example, field
    excursions to the following areas included visits of multiple geothermal systems:n-

    Springs, Howard Hot Spring, MacFarlane Hot Spring, McGee Mountain, and Pinto Hot
    Springs in northwest Nevada.n- Northu2010central to northeastern Nevada: Beowawe,

    Golconda, and Pumpernickel Valley (Tipton Hot Springs) in northu2010central to northeast
    Nevada.n- Eastern Nevada: Ash Springs, Chimney Hot Spring, Duckwater, Hiko Hot Spring,
    Hot Creek Butte, Iverson Spring, Moon River Hot Spring, Moorman Spring, Railroad

    Joseph Hot Spring, Hatton Hot Spring, and Abrahamu2010Baker Hot Springs.nnStructural
    controls of 426 geothermal systems were analyzed with literature research, air photos,
    googleu2010Earth imagery, and/or field reviews (Figures 1 and 2). Of the systems
    analyzed, we were able to determine the structural settings of more than 240 sites.
    However, we found that many u201csystemsu201d consisted of little more than a warm
    or hot well in the central part of a basin. Such u201csystemsu201d were difficult
    to evaluate in terms of structural setting in areas lacking in geophysical data.nnDeveloped
    database for structural catalogue in a master spreadsheet. Data components include
    structural setting, primary fault orientation, presence or absence of Quaternary
    faulting, reservoir lithology, geothermometry, presence or absence of recent magmatism,
    and distinguishing blind systems from those that have surface expressions.nnReviewed
    site locations for all 426 geothermal systemsu2013 Confirmed and/or relocated spring
    and geothermal sites based on imagery, maps, and other information for master database.
    Many systems were mislocated in the original database. In addition, some systems
    that included several separate springs spread over large areas were divided into
    two or more distinct systems. Further, all hot wells were assigned names based on
    their location to facilitate subsequent analyses.nWe catalogued systems into the
    following eight major groups, based on the dominant pattern of faulting (Figure
    1):n- Major normal fault segments (i.e., near displacement maxima).n- Fault bends.n-
    Fault terminations or tips.n- Stepu2010overs or relay ramps in normal faults.n-
    Fault intersections.n- Accommodation zones (i.e., belts of intermeshing oppositely
    dipping normal faults),n- Displacement transfer zones whereby strikeu2010slip faults
    terminate in arrays of normal faults.n- Transtensional pullu2010aparts.nnThese settings
    form a hierarchal pattern with respect to fault complexity.n- Major normal faults
    and fault bends are the simplest.n- Fault terminations are typically more complex
    than midu2010segments, as faults commonly break up into multiple strands or horsetail
    near their ends.n- A fault intersection is generally more complex, as it generally
    contains both multiple fault strands and can include discrete dilational quadrants.n-
    A stepu2010over consists of two overlapping fault terminations and thus involves
    additional complexity, especially where the relay ramp is breached by multiple fault
    splays between the main overlapping faults and thus contains multiple fault intersections.n-
    Accommodation zones involve further complexity, as they contain multiple fault terminations
    and fault intersections.nnOf the 426 fields analyzed, major findings include (Figures
    1 and 2):n- 39% of the known systems are blind or hidden (Figure 1), with no surface
    hot springs or fumaroles.n- The structural setting for ~25% of the systems could
    not be determined (Figure 2). In most cases, undetermined systems reside in the
    central part of a basin (commonly warm wells) that lacks adequate geophysical data
    for elucidating the subsurface structure.n- Stepu2010overs or relay ramps in normal
    faults are the most favorable setting (Figure 2), hosting ~32% of the systems analyzed.
    Such areas are characterized by multiple, commonly overlapping fault strands, increased
    fracture density, and thus enhanced permeability.n- Normal fault terminations host
    25%.n- Intersections of normal faults and strikeu2010slip or obliqueu2010slip faults
    host 22%.n- Accommodation zones (belts of intermeshing oppositely dipping normal
    faults) host 9%.n- Displacement transfer zones host 5%.n- Pullu2010aparts in strikeu2010slip
    faults host 3%.n- Bends in major normal faults host 2%.n- Major rangeu2010front
    faults host 1% of the known systems.nSome of the more robust systems contain more
    than one type of structural setting. These include Steamboat, Coso, and Dixie Valley.
    About 21% of the fields are hybrid or compound systems.nnPullu2010aparts and displacement
    transfer zones are more abundant in the transtensional western part of the Great
    Basin.nnAn analysis of the relations between Quaternary faulting and geothermal
    systems was completed for the Great Basin region. The 426 localities were overlain
    on USGS Quaternary fault database in GoogleEarth to evaluate proximity to mapped
    faults and look for unrecognized faults.n- Quaternary faults typically lie within
    or near most of the geothermal systems.n- Geothermal fields were evaluated with
    proximity to Quaternary faults classified in 4 categories: <1 km, 1u20102 km, 1u20105
    km, 1u201010 km.n- Fault ages were classified as historical, Holocene, late Pleistocene,
    midu2010Pleistocene, and Quaternary undivided.n- The highest percentage of highu2010temp
    sites are within 2 km of Quaternary faults. This suggests a statistical correlation
    between proximity to active faults and highu2010temp resources.nnGeothermal systems
    are rare along major rangeu2010front faults, possibly due to both reduced permeability
    in thick zones of clay gouge and periodic release of stress in major earthquakes.nnStepu2010overs,
    terminations, intersections, and accommodation zones correspond to longu2010term,
    critically stressed areas, where fluid pathways would more likely remain open in
    networks of closelyu2010spaced, brecciau2010dominated fractures.n",nt"license_title":
