    with 2x2 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of a selected portion of seafloor
    southwest of Vieques Island, derived from data collected in March and April 2009.
    NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy
    Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry
    data around Vieques Island from 3/26/09 to 4/2/09. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted
    Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) for water depths greater
    than 75 meters, and with a moon pool flange-mounted Reson 7125 multibeam echosounder
    (dual frequecy, 200/400 kHz) for water depths of less than 75 meters. It was processed
    by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied
    (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using
    final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum
    NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based
    on swath angle. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened
    in ESRI ArcMap 9.x as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature
    to Raster' was used to generate the final ESRI Geotiff. The project was conducted
    to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependent on the project area and
    depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according
    to their own needs and standards.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
