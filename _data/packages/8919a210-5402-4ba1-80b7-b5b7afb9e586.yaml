  high likelihood of acting as fluid flow conduits (Sibson, 1994). As such, the tendency
  of a fault segment to slip (slip tendency; Ts; Morris et al., 1996) or to dilate
  (dilation tendency; Td; Ferrill et al., 1999) provides an indication of which faults
  or fault segments within a geothermal system are critically stressed and therefore
  likely to transmit geothermal fluids. The slip tendency of a surface is defined
  by the ratio of shear stress to normal stress on that surface:nTs = u03c4 / u03c3n
  t(Morris et al., 1996).nDilation tendency is defined by the stress acting normal
  to a given surface:nTd = (u03c31-u03c3n) / (u03c31-u03c33) t(Ferrill et al., 1999).
  nSlip and dilation were calculated using 3DStress (Southwest Research Institute).nSlip
  and dilation tendency are both unitless ratios of the resolved stresses applied
  to the fault plane by ambient stress conditions. Values range from a maximum of
  1, a fault plane ideally oriented to slip or dilate under ambient stress conditions
  to zero, a fault plane with no potential to slip or dilate. Slip and dilation tendency
  values were calculated for each fault in the focus study areas at, McGinness Hills,
  Neal Hot Springs, Patua, Salt Wells, San Emidio, and Tuscarora on fault traces.
  As dip is not well constrained or unknown for many faults mapped in within these
  we made these calculations using the dip for each fault that would yield the maximum
  slip tendency or dilation tendency. As such, these results should be viewed as maximum
  tendency of each fault to slip or dilate. The resulting along-fault and fault-to-fault
  variation in slip or dilation potential is a proxy for along fault and fault-to-fault
  variation in fluid flow conduit potential.nStress Magnitudes and directionsnStress
  field variation within each focus area was approximated based on regional published
  data and the world stress database (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait
  et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2010; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and
  Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012; Moeck et al., 2010; Moos and Ronne, 2010
  and Reinecker et al., 2005) as well as local stress information if applicable. For
  faults within these focus systems we applied either a normal faulting stress regime
  where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax)
  which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin) or strike-slip
  faulting stress regime where the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) is larger than
  the vertical stress (sv) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (shmax
  >sv>shmin) depending on the general tectonic province of the system. Based on visual
  inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin we used magnitudes
  such that shmin/shmax = .527 and shmin/sv= .46, which are consistent with complete
  and partial stress field determinations from Desert Peak, Coso, the Fallon area
  and Dixie valley (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al.,
  2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2011; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes
  2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012). nnSlip and dilation tendency for the Salt Wells
  geothermal field was calculated based on the faults mapped in the Bunejug Mountains
  quadrangle (Hinz et al., 2011). The Salt Wells area lies in the Basin and Range
  Province (N. Hinz personal comm.) As such we applied a normal faulting stress regime
  to the Salt Wells area faults, with a minimum horizontal stress direction oriented
  105, based on inspection of local and regional stress determinations. Under these
  stress conditions north-northeast striking, steeply dipping fault segments have
  the highest dilation tendency, while north-northeast striking 60u00b0 dipping fault
  segments have the highest tendency to slip. Several such faults intersect in high
  density in the core of the accommodation zone in the Bunejug Mountains and local
  to the Salt Wells geothermal .\",\n\t\t\"format\": \"ZIP\",\n\t\t\"tracking_summary\":
