    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Anomaly detection has recently become an
    important problem in many industrial and financial applications. In several instances,
    the data to be analyzed for possible anomalies is located at multiple sites and
    cannot be merged due to practical constraints such as bandwidth limitations and
    proprietary concerns. At the same time, the size of data sets affects prediction
    quality in almost all data mining applications. In such circumstances, distributed
    data mining algorithms may be used to extract information from multiple data sites
    in order to make better predictions. In the absence of theoretical guarantees, however,
    the degree to which data decentralization affects the performance of these algorithms
    is not known, which reduces the data providing participants' incentive to cooperate.This
    creates a metaphorical 'prisoners' dilemma' in the context of data mining.rnrn rnrnIn
    this work, we propose a novel general framework for distributed anomaly detection
    with theoretical performance guarantees. Our algorithmic approach combines existing
    anomaly detection procedures with a novel method for computing global statistics
    using local sufficient statistics. We show that the performance of such a distributed
    approach is indistinguishable from that of a centralized instantiation of the same
    anomaly detection algorithm, a condition that we call zero information loss. We
    further report experimental results on synthetic as well as real-world data to demonstrate
    the viability of our approach.rnrn The remaining content of this presentation is

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
