    (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japan satellite mission to monitor tropical and subtropical
    precipitation and to estimate its associated latent heating. TRMM was successfully
    launched on November 27, at 4:27 PM (EST) from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan.nnThe
    TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR), the first of its kind in space, is an electronically
    scanning radar, operating at 13.8 GHz that measures the 3-D rainfall distribution
    over both land and ocean, and defines the layer depth of the precipitation.nnPR
    2A23 produces a rain/no-rain flag. Its main objectives are (1) to detect bright
    band (BB), (2) to classify rain type, and (3) to detect warm rain.nn2A23 uses two
    different methods for classifying rain type: (1) vertical profile method (V-method)
    and (2) horizontal pattern method (H-method).  Both methods classify rain into three
    categories: stratiform, convective, and other. To make the results user-friendly,
    2A23 outputs a unified rain type. Further information about 2A23 can be found in
    Awaka et al. (1998).nnThe V-method starts with the detection of BB. This detection
    is made by a spatial filter, based on the second derivative of Z with respect to
    range, and by imposing several conditions on BB (e.g., Z above BB peak should decrease
    appreciably, the height of BB should appear almost at the same height). One of the
    major conditions imposed on BB is that the height of BB must be located in a BB
    window, whose range is from freezH - 1.5 km to freezH + 1.5 km, where freezH is
    the height of freezing level estimated from a climatological surface temperature
    at sea level, Tsurface, by the following formula:nn  freezH = Tsurface / Tlapse,nnand
    where Tlapse is the lapse rate of temperature (2A23 assumes that Tlapse = 6.0 (deg/km)).nnAfter
    the BB detection, the V-method goes on to classify rain type. The outline of rain
    type classification by the V-method is as follows:nn  1. When BB exists, rain is
    basically classified as stratiform.nn  2. When BB is not detected, and maximum value
    of Z at a given angle bin exceeds a convective threshold, rain type for this angle
    bin is classified as convective.nn  3. Other type is defined as not-stratiform and
    not-convective.nnIt should be noted that other type of rain by the V-method is defined
    as not-convective and not-stratiform, i.e., (1) there exists appreciable radar echo,
    but it is not strong enough to be convective and (2) BB is not detected.nnThe H-method
    also classifies rain into 3 categories: stratiform, convective, and other. However,
    their definitions are different from those of the V-method.nnThe H-method is based
    on the University of Washington convective/stratiform separation method (Steiner
    et al., 1995), which examines the horizontal pattern of Z at a given height, where
    Z has a 2 km horizontal resolution. In 2A23, the following modifications are made:nn
     1. Instead of examining a horizontal pattern of Z at a given height, a horizontal
    pattern of Zmax is examined; here, Zmax is the maximum of Z along the range for
    each antenna scan angle below freezH (minus 1 km margin).nn  2. Parameters are changed
    so that they may be suitable for the TRMM data with 4.3 km horizontal resolution.
    The parameters were chosen before the launch of TRMM, using test Ground Validation
    (GV) data in such a way that the 4.3 km resolution data produce almost the same
    result as that with a 2 km resolution data.n   n  3. Other type of rain is introduced
    to handle noise.nnIn the H-method, detection of convective rain is made first. If
    one of the following conditions is satisfied for a pixel, which corresponds to the
    angle bin data being considered, it is judged that the pixel is a convective center:
    (1) Zmax exceeds a convective threshold or (2) Zmax stands out against the background
    area.nnRain type for a convective center is convective, and rain type for the pixels
    nearest to the convective center is also convective.nnIn the H-method, if rain type
    is not convective and if the...",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
