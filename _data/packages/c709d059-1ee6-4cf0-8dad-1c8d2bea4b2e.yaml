    5 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of selected portions of seafloor around
    Bajo De Cico in Puerto Rico, derived from data collected in 2007.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA
    Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory,
    federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in Puerto
    Rico from 4/14/07 to 4/24/07. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad
    EM 1002 (95 kHz) multibeam echosounder. It was processed by a NOAA contractor using
    CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity)
    and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and
    zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 19 north, datum NAD83. The processed
    CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. An ASCII
    XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9.x using
    an XYZ to raster tool and saved as an ESRI Geotiff. The project was conducted to
    meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependent on the project area and depth.
    All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to
    their own needs and standards.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
