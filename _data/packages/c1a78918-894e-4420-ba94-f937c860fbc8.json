	"notes": "This paper proposes the experiments and setups for studying diagnosis and prognosis of electrolytic capacitors in DC-DC power converters. Electrolytic capacitors and power MOSFETu2019s have higher failure rates than other components in DC-DC converter systems. Currently, our work focuses on experimental analysis and modeling electrolytic capacitors degradation and its effects on the output of DC-DC converter systems. The output degradation is typically measured by the increase in Equivalent series resistance and decrease in capacitance leading to output ripple currents.Typically, the ripple current effects dominate, and they can have adverse effects on downstream components.rnA model based approach to studying degradation phenomena enables us to combine the physics based modeling of the DC-DC converter with physics of failure models of capacitor degradation, and predict using stochastic simulation methods how system performance deteriorates with time. Degradation experiments were conducted where electrolytic capacitors were subjected to electrical and thermal stress to accelerate the aging of the system. This more systematic analysis may provide a more general and accurate method for computing the remaining useful life (RUL) of the component and the converter system. ",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
