	"notes": "&lt;p&gt;rntCandidate hydrazine alternatives have been developed for spacecraft propulsion. The U.S. Air Force AF-M315E and the Swedish ammonium dinitramide propellants have received the most attention, while ammonium dinitramide propellants are a possible contender. While greenness relates to environmentally benign and relative toxicity, neither of these propellants is completely &amp;ldquo;nontoxic&amp;rdquo; or completely safe; if their energetic nature was not inherent they would not be used as monopropellants. This is particularly important with ammonium dinitramide (ADN) and hydrazinum nitroformate (HNF) propellants, which ESA and the EU has favored while the U.S. Air Force has focused on AF-M315E and the U.S. Army has investigated hydroxylammonium nitrate/triethanolammonium nitrate (HAN/TEAN; XM-46) propellants.&amp;nbsp; The first phase of the project&amp;rsquo;s focus will be to evaluate detection and decontamination methods for these propellants.&amp;nbsp; The second phase examined candidate materials for use in AF-M315E propulsion systems. Pairs of representative alloys, passivated and native, were immersed in AF-M315E at 71 &amp;deg;C for 31 d, fluid samples were periodically characterized and post-test materials and fluids were finally characterized. Typical corrosion studies use only the total time of immersion; this study also obtained interim data points.&lt;/p&gt;rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
