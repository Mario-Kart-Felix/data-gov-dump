    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    known and novel prognostic algorithms on systems that can be described by low dimensional,
    potentially nonlinear dynamics. The methods rely on estimating the conditional probability
    distribution of the output of the system at a future time given knowledge of the
    current state of the system. We show how to estimate these conditional probabilities
    using a variety of techniques, including bagged neural networks and kernel methods
    such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The results are compared with standard
    method such as the nearest neighbor algorithm. We demonstrate the algorithms on
    a real-world data set and a simulated data set. The real-world data set consists
    of the intensity of an NH3 laser. The laser data set has been shown by other authors
    to exhibit low-dimensional chaos with sudden drops in intensity. The simulated data
    set is generated from the Lorenz attractor and has known statistical characteristics.
    On these data sets, we show the evolution of the estimated conditional probability
    distribution, the way it can act as a prognostic signal, and its use as an early
    warning system. We also review a novel approach to perform Gaussian Process Regression
    with large numbers of data points.",nt"owner_org": "d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed",nt"extras":
