	"notes": "Roman Catholic Churches In Large Cities in Arkansas This dataset includes buildings where Roman Catholics gather for organized worship in cities with a population of 50,000 people or more. Roman Catholic Churches are Christian Churches that are subject to the papal authority in Rome. In addition to what are commonly thought of as Roman Catholic Churches, this data set also includes Newman (or Neumann) Centers and Chaldean Churches. Newman Centers are Roman Catholic Churches setup specifically to serve college or university populations. The Chaldean Church (also known as the Chaldean Church of Babylon) reunited with the Catholic Church in the 15th century. It originated in the Middle East. If a group of Roman Catholics gather for organized worship at a location that also serves another function, such as a school, these locations are included in this dataset if they otherwise meet the criteria for inclusion. Roman Catholic Shrines are included if they hold regularly scheduled mass. If a congregation celebrates mass at multiple locations, we have tried to include all such locations. This dataset excludes churches that are not subject to papal authority in Rome. Some churches may refer to themselves as \"Catholic\", and yet not be part of the \"Roman\" Catholic Church and these Churches are excluded from this dataset. Specifically Protestant Churches and their descendants which separated from the Roman Catholic Church beginning in 1517, Eastern Orthodox Churches (e.g. Russian, Greek) which separated from the Roman Catholic Church in 1054, and Episcopalian (Church of England in America) which separated from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534 are excluded. The 22 \"Eastern Catholic autonomous particular churches\", with the exception of the Chaldean Church, are also excluded. These are Churches which are in full communion with the Pope in Rome, but which practice their own rites which are different from the Western or Latin Roman Catholic Church. This dataset excludes rectories. Private homes, even if they are used for formal worship, are excluded from this dataset. Locations that are only used for administrative purposes are also excluded. This dataset also includes original TGS research. All data is non license restricted data. TGS has ceased making phone calls to verify information about religious locations. Therefore all entities in this dataset were \u00e2\u0080\u009cverified\u00e2\u0080\u009d using alternative reference sources, such as topo maps, parcel maps, various sources of imagery, and internet research. The [CONTHOW] (contact how) attribute for these entities has been set to \u00e2\u0080\u009cALT REF\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. Based upon this attribute, the oldest record dates from 2007\/09\/05 and the newest record dates from 2007\/09\/05",
