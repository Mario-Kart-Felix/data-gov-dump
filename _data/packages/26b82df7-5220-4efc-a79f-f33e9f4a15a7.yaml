  of most states are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions aren               known
  as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are then
  \              organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the
  unorganized area,n               census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively
  for statistical purposes by then               State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.
  In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada,n               and Virginia), there
  are one or more incorporated places that are independent of anyn               county
  organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states. Thesen               incorporated
  places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalentn               entities
  for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have non               primary
  divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes ofn               data
  presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents ofn
  \              counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto
  Rico, Districts andn               Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in
  the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianan               Islands, and Islands in
  the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the Unitedn               States, Puerto
  Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalentn               entities.
  The Economic Census county shapefile is similar to the current shapefilen               except
  that the boundaries are as of January 1, 2012, in order to match the vintagen               of
  the 2012 Economic Census. The one exception is Guam, where the county subdivisionsn
  \              substitute as county equivalent entities for the Economic Census.n
