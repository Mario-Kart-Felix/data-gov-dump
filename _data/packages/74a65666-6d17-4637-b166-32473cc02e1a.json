	"notes": "We propose the potential to develop significant improvements to size, weight, and prime power requirements of front-end cw lasers and associated frequency stabilization and offset-locking photonics and electronics that are utilized in laser-based remote sensing systems for the measurement of atmospheric CO2 concentrations and wind velocity.  The emphasis in the proposed program is to develop stable front-end sources for 2-micron wavelength systems, but it is anticipated that much of the design will be readily applicable to a broad array of short-wave IR wavelengths, e.g. 1.57 micron, by the use of alternative laser gain media.  Although the Phase I design and Phase II implementation will be aimed at airborne platforms, only designs that have a clear and practical path to future space-based implementation will be considered.  The Beyond Photonics team is uniquely qualified to explore the state-of-the-art in relevant lasers and frequency stabilization techniques and develop improved front-end systems that have a demonstrable path to robust, compact airborne and space-based applications.  Our team's deep experience with such systems lends a perspective that will yield significant gains in system compactness, efficiency, and autonomous reliability for a wide array of applications relevant to NASA's missions, and improve the viability for other commercial and military applications in eye-safe remote sensing.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
