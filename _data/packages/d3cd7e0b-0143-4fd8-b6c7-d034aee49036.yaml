  Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
  reef ecosystems, from 8 September - 7 October 2002, marine invertebrate quantitative
  assessments were conducted, as part of Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA), during
  the Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruise TC0207 in the NW Hawaiian
  Islands. Such cruises are conducted at biennial intervals by the Coral Reef Ecosystem
  Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). At
  specific reef sites, marine invertebrate zoologists along with coral and algal biologists
  entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~100 m2) and high degree of taxonomic
  resolution benthic REA survey for coral, algae, and key invertebrate species. Invertebrate
  surveys were focused on quantifying key non-coral invertebrate species common to
  the reef habitats, and were conducted using a combination of different survey techniques
  to quantify the diverse communities. These methods included belt-transect surveys,
  roving-swim surveys, and quadrat surveys. In belt-transect surveys, quantitative
  counts of key invertebrates were recorded along two consecutively-placed 25m long
  and 2m wide belt transects (total area = 100 m2). For any species that cannot be
  identified in the field, a photograph and a representative specimen, if possible,
  is collected for later identification. Roving-swim surveys were conducted in the
  general area with the goal to collect qualitative data for rare, larger, and cryptic
  organisms, such as Crown of Thorns Starfish and Triton's Trumpet snails which may
  not be seen during belt-transect surveys, and to survey any additional habitats
  present at the site, e.g. sand, sea grass, pavement, etc. This was accomplished
  by swimming a zig-zag pattern that extends roughly 5 m on either side of the two
  transect lines (total length = 500 m). Quadrat surveys were used to quantify the
  smaller, more cryptic invertebrates which were sometimes overlooked or too numerous
  to count during belt-transect surveys. Ten 0.25-m2 quadrats were laid out at 2-m
  intervals along two of the 25-m transects (total area = 5 m2). For each quadrat
  the percent cover of sponges, octocorals and zoanthids was recorded, as well as
  urchins, hermit crabs of the genus Calcinus, trapezid crabs, and coralliophilid
  snails. In addition, up to 25 cm diameters of all urchin species are measured. Based
  on data from previous REA surveys, a group of target invertebrate species was chosen
  for quantitative counts at 2 REA sites at Necker Island in the NW Hawaiian Islands.
  The species in the list were chosen because they have been shown to be common components
  of the reef habitats and they are species that are generally visible (i.e.; non-cryptic)
  and easily enumerated during the course of a single 50-60 minute SCUBA survey.\",\n\t\"owner_org\":
