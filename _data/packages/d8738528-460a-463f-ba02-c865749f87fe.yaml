    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "These water quality data are one of many
    studies being done to assess and monitor coral reef ecosystems. The intent of this
    work is three fold: (1) to spatially characterize and monitor the distribution,
    abundance, and size of both reef fishes and macro-invertebrates (conch, lobster,
    Diadema); (2) to relate this information to in-situ data collected on water quality
    and associated habitat parameters; (3) to use this information to establish the
    knowledge base necessary for enacting management decisions in a spatial setting
    and to establish the efficacy of those management decisions. Toward this end, the
    Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment's Biogeography Team (BT) has completed
    its fourth year and is beginning its fifth year of work in the US Virgin Islands
    and Puerto Rico. It is critical, with recent changes in management at both locations
    (e.g. implementation of MPAs) as well as proposed changes (e.g. zoning to manage
    multiple human uses) that action is taken now to accurately describe and characterize
    the fish/macro-invertebrate populations in these areas. It is also important that
    BT work closely with the individuals responsible for recommending and implementing
    these management strategies. Recognizing this, BT has been collaborating with partners
    at the University of Puerto Rico, National Park Service, US Geological Survey and
    the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources. To quantify patterns
    of spatial distribution and make meaningful interpretations, we must first have
    knowledge of the underlying variables determining species distribution. The basis
    for this work therefore, is the nearshore benthic habitats maps (less than 100 ft
    depth) created by NOAA's Biogeography Program in 2001 and NOS' bathymetry models.
    Using ArcView GIS software, the digitized habitat maps are stratified to select
    sampling stations. Sites are randomly selected within these strata to ensure coverage
    of the entire study region and not just a particular reef or seagrass area. At each
    site, fish, macro-invertebrates, and associated water quality and habitat information
    is then quantified following standardized protocols. By relating the data collected
    in the field back to the habitat maps and bathymetric models, BT is able to model
    and map species level and community level information. These protocols are standardized
    throughout the US Caribbean to enable quantification and comparison of reef fish
    abundance and distribution trends between locations. Armed with the knowledge of
    where "hot spots" of species richness and diversity are likely to occur in the
    seascape, the BT is in a unique position to answer questions about the efficacy
    of marine zoning strategies (e.g. placement of no fishing, anchoring, or snorkeling
    locations), and what locations are most suitable for establishing MPAs. Knowledge
    of the current status of fish/macro-invertebrate communities coupled with longer
    term monitoring will enable evaluation of management efficacy, thus it is essential
    to future management actions.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
