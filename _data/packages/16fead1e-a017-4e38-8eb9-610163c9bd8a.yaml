    The orignal data set was collected through visual field observation by Greg Linscombe
    of LDWF and Robert H. Chabreck of LSU Agricultural Center. The observations were
    made while flying over the study areas (Louisiana Coastal Zone) in a Bell 206 Jet
    Ranger helicopter. Flight was along north/south transects spaced 1.87 miles apart
    from the Texas state line to the Mississippi state line. Vegetative data was obtained
    at pre-determined stations spaced at 0.5 miles along each transect. The stations
    were located using a Trimble Ag 122 Global Positioning system (GPS) and a computer
    running GPSView by Geowarehouse. This information was recorded manually into field
    tally sheets and later was entered into a Microsoft Access Database. At this point,
    this information was brought into a GIS application by converting the file to database
    format (dbf). A GIS software application was utilized to generate the points along
    the transect routes. The flight line data was used as a guide to generate the points
    along the transect routes. The data points produced were used as a guide for the
    production of marsh type delineation lines. The new data set resulted in a point
    coverage containing vegetative marsh type attributes along transect flight lines.
    Coverage is of the coastal region of the State of Louisiana.",nt"license_title":
