    is a set of nine annual phenological metrics for the conterminous United States.
    Researchers at the USGS EROS Center utilize data gathered by satellite sensors to
    track seasonal changes in vegetation. The satellite sensors that provide the raw
    data are the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) from National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar-orbiting satellites. The satellite data
    are initially transformed into Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values.
    AVHRR NDVI provide the foundation for the phenology metrics. Time-series NDVI can
    be summarized and analyzed to produce nine key phenological indicators that represent
    a complete growing season. These data represent a powerful tool for documenting
    plant life-cycle trends over time and detecting the impacts of climate change on
    ecosystems. The complete set of phenological metrics are as follows: 1. Start of
    Season Time (SOST): starting time of the onset of the growing season (in day of
    the year). 2. Start of Season NDVI (SOSN): NDVI value at the starting time of the
    onset of the growing season (unitless- based on NDVI units). 3. End of Season Time
    (EOST): ending time of the growing season (in day of the year). 4. End of Season
    NDVI (EOSN): NDVI value at the ending time of the growing season (unitless-based
    on NDVI units). 5. Maximum Time (MAXT): the day of the year when the NDVI reaches
    its maximum during the growing season (in day of the year). 6. Maximum NDVI (MAXN):
    the highest (or peak) value in NDVI observed in a growing season (unitless-based
    on NDVI units). 7. Duration (DUR): the length of the growing season-the time between
    the start of season and end of season (in number of days). 8. Amplitude (AMP): the
    difference between the Maximum NDVI and NDVI at the day of start of season (unitless-based
    on NDVI units). 9. Time Integrated NDVI (TIN): the cumulative value of NDVI from
    the start to the end of the growing season.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
