	"notes": "Remote sensing of optical properties of coastal waters provides essential information for various scientific questions &amp; applications as monitoring biological biomass &amp; productivity, biogeochemical carbon cycling, pollution, ecosystem health.  OKSI, with Scripps Institution of Oceanography, propose developing a novel submersible instrument that provides simultaneous multi-depth (0-10 m) measurements of upwelling &amp; downwelling radiative fluxes in the UV-VIS-NIR at high spectral resolution.  The measurements are needed to support ocean color algorithm development, validation, &amp; application to remote sensing measurement for the retrieval of biochemical &amp; optical ocean parameters.  All electronics components will be above water &amp; the submersible will require no power or electronics.rnIn Phase I underwater radiative transfer analysis will be conducted to establish the science requirements &amp; translate those into sensor design.  The submersible sensor system will be designed and modeled to assure that it meets the science requirements of SNR, dynamic range, &amp; spectral resolution.  Calibration procedures will be established to assure high data quality.  In Phase-II the prototype instrument will be built and tested at sea &amp; data compared to other SIO instruments.  rnThe proposed system will quantify the underwater downwelling irradiance and upwelling radiance through simultaneous measurements at several depths (plus the downwelling irradiance incident upon the sea surface), filling a major gap in technological capabilities for providing accurate light field determinations at the ocean surface from data taken within optically dynamic near-surface ocean layer.  In this layer, the usage of commercial radiometers and common measurement strategies is typically inadequate.  This proposed development will improve retrievals of remote-sensing reflectance and consequently information about in-water constituents/properties.  The project outcome at the end of Phase-II will be at TRL 6.  ",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
