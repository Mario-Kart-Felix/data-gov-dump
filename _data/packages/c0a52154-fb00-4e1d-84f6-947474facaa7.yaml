    collection consists of a globaln                set of high-quality, relatively
    cloud-free orthorectified MSS, TM and ETM+ imageryn                from Landsats
    1-5 and 7. This dataset was selected and generated through NASA'sn                Commercial
    Remote Sensing Program, as part of a cooperative effort between NASA andn                the
    commercial remote sensing community to provide users with access ton                quality-screened,
    high-resolution satellite images with global coverage over then                Earth's
    land masses. The data collection was compiled via NASA contract with Earthn                Satellite
    Corporation (Rockville, MD) in association with NASA's Scientific Datan                Purchase
    program. The Landsat Orthorectified data collection consists ofn                approximately
    7,500 MSS (Landsat 1-5) images, 7,461 TM (Landsat 4-5) images andn                approximately
    8,500 ETM+ (Landsat 7) images, which were selected to provide two fulln                sets
    of global coverage over an approximate 10-year interval (circa 1990 and circan                2000).
    All selected images were either cloud-free or contained minimal cloud cover.n                In
    addition, only images with a high quality ranking in regards to the possiblen                presence
    of errors such as missing scans or saturated bands were selected. Purpose:n                To
    provide users with access to quality-screened, high-resolution satellite imagesn
                   with global coverage over the Earth's land masses. Supplemental_Information:
    Then                average acquisition date for the Landsat Orthorectified ETM+
    data is 2000 (+/- 1n                year). All scenes were acquired between 1999
    and 2001. These data have beenn                orthorectified for coregistration
    with the earlier (circa 1990) Landsat TM coverage.",nt"license_title": "U.S.

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
