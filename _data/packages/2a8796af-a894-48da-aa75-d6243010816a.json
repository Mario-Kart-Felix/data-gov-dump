	"notes": "As part of the FAA's plans for modernization of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system, Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) will be the basis of the future surveillance system in the US, supplemented by the current Radar system. With significantly more frequent updates and higher data quality than radar, ADS-B provides unprecedented access to general aviation operational data. Given this unique opportunity, Aurora proposes to conduct an in-depth analysis of the potential for ADS-B derived operational data to identify operations with a reduced safety margin &amp;#150; similar to the FAA's voluntary Flight Operation Quality Assurance (FOQA) safety program.  Since comprehensive operational data of this quality and magnitude has not been available until now, new and innovative approaches for their analysis are needed. rnrnUltimately, the goal of the proposed effort is to provide a "big data" capability for using ADS-B data to identify the underlying causes and pre-cursers for a majority of aviation accidents. The insights from this analysis could then be used to identify approaches for improving aviation safety and lead to recommendations about where to focus educational efforts, recurring training or proficiency checks. These insights may also lead to the re-design or introduction of avionics that specifically address the true underlying causes of accidents.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
