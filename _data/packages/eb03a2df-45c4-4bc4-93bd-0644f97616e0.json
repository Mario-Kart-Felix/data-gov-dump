	"notes": "This dataset contains a unified ESRI Grid with 10 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of selected portions of seafloor around La Parguera, P.R. and St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John in the US Virgin Islands, derived from data collected in 2004, 2005 and 2006. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04, 2/1/05 to 2/12/05 and 3/21/06 to 4/2/06. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) in 2004 and 2005, and with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) in 2006. It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9.x as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster' was used to generate the final ESRI Grid. The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.",
