	"notes": "A general framework for probabilistic prognosis using maximum entropy approach, MRE, is proposed in this paper to include all available information and uncertainties for RUL prediction. Prognosis metrics are used for model comparison and performance evaluation. Several conclusions can be drawn based on the results in the current investigation: The proposed MRE updating approach results in more accurate and precise prediction compared with the classical Bayesian method. The classical Bayesian method is a special case of the proposed MRE approach and MRE approach is more flexible to include additional information for inference, which cannot be handled by the classical Bayesian method. The prognosis metrics can be successfully used for algorithm comparison and can give quantitative values in model (algorithm) performance evaluation. A robustness metric measuring the updating algorithmic sensitivity to prior uncertainty is proposed and applied to both Bayesian and MRE updating approaches. The application examples show that MRE exhibits more robustness against the uncertainty introduced by parameter distribution priors in the sense of prognosis performance. It is important to realize when to apply these metrics to arrive at meaningful interpretations. For instance, use of the convergence metric makes sense only when the algorithm predictions converge (get better) with time.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
