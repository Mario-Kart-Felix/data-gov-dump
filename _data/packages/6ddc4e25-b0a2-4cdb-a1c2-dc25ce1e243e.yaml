    portions of Jasper and Newton Counties, Missouri; Cherokee County, Kansas; and Ottawa
    County, Oklahoma, was mined intensively for zinc and lead for more than 100 yr.
    Wastes from historic mining, smelting, and related activities have contaminated
    surface and ground waters. The Tri-State District is drained by the Spring-Neosho
    River system, which supports populations of the Neosho madtom (Noturus placidus),
    a federally listed threatened fish species (Williams et al. 1989; Wenke and Eberle
    1991). This study was designed and implemented to determine the toxicity of pore-water
    collected in potentially suitable N. placidus habitat in the Spring River system
    affected by mining. Pore-water was collected from sites in the Spring River and
    its tributaries to assess toxicity to standard test organisms. Pore-water toxicity
    testing provides a means for assessing sediment quality. A field study was conducted
    in September, 1995 to determine the toxicity of porewater and sediments in the Spring
    River and two tributaries. Sites were also sampled in an effort to better characterize
    the Neosho madtom habitat preferences, and benthic macroinvertebrate samples were
    collected and analyzed to determine associations between these organisms and N.
    placidus abundance and distribution. Samples of surface and interstitial (pore)
    waters were collected and analyzed for a suite of water quality parameters and for
    mining-derived metals, and to be used in toxicity tests. The physical characteristics
    of the sites were also quantified. Biological sampling revealed that, consistent
    with previous studies, Neosho madtoms were generally most abundant on gravel bars
    containing proportionally greater amounts of fine material and lesser amounts of
    coarse gravel and stones. In the Spring River, this study confirmed the extension
    of the known range of the species from the confluence of Willow Creek, in Baxter
    Springs, Cherokee County, Kansas, upstream to Waco, Jasper County, Missouri (Wilkinson
    et al. 1996). It may also occur as far upstream in Jasper County as the confluence
    of the Spring River mainstem and its North Fork but our sampling did not find any
    N. placidus at those locations. Length-frequency distributions indicated the presence
    of young-of-the-year at several Spring River sites, but the whereabouts of spawning
    sites and other aspects of the reproductive biology of the Spring River population
    remain unknown. N. placidus has not been found in any Spring River tributary sampled
    to date, nor has it been found in the Spring River downstream of Baxter Springs.
    A combination of physical, biological, and chemical factors may presently limit
    the distribution and abundance of the Neosho madtom in the Spring River. Among the
    latter, concentrations of zinc and other mining-derived metals in the Spring River
    below Center Creek, and in both Shoal and Center Creeks may be sufficiently high
    to affect N. placidus.",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras":
