    would warrant remediation were not identified on any of the study plots. However,
    trumpeter swans and at least in prior years, Canada geese both have been documented
    to be affected with lead poisoning. There may be several explanations why densities
    of lead shot were not found during the study. The methodology described by Anderson
    (1986) in collecting soil samples is most likely adequate to have identified spent
    lead shot if it was present on the sites that were surveyed. Thus, the shot may
    simply not have been there; it may have been buried deeply by past agricultural
    or water management practices; or the lead shot that geese and swans do ingest were
    found in areas that were not sampled. Given the distances that geese and swans fly
    to forage or roost, it is not practical or realistic to develop a sampling protocol
    that could account for all possible sites where they could encounter spent lead
    shot. This study attempted to narrow the potential sites by identifying areas where
    birds were foraging and loafing, or areas that were historically known to have had
    extensive hunting activity. Both these efforts proved to be unproductive in identifying
    potential sites for ingestion. Fields for survey were selected based on goose use,
    and/or hunting pressure. The majority of these were inactive agricultural practice,
    which includes the tillage of the soil surface. It may be that any shot present
    on the surface had already been incorporated into the soil profile and is currently
    not available to foraging geese. Even though lead shot was not found to be a problem
    in agricultural fields on the refuge, many refuge fields are currently being converted
    to native grasslands, further eliminating the potential risk of lead shot ingestion.
    The wetlands that were surveyed were selected based on their past history as duck
    hunting clubs. Thus, if there were to be any concentrations of lead in refuge wetlands,
    it would have been on these sites. It is quite possible that during the 65 years
    of refuge ownership management, the habitat has changed such that past hunting areas
    are no longer open areas where surveys could take place (e.g., dense stands of cattail
    were not surveyed due to the inaccessibility of the area to waterfowl and technicians),
    or the spent lead shot has been buried in sediments past the depth that was surveyed
    and hopefully past the depth at which swans and geese can access. While the results
    of this study did not identify sites where geese and swans could potentially access
    and ingest lead pellets, there are potentially many other sites which could provide
    access but were simply not surveyed.",nt"owner_org": "4d7ad1cd-3641-420b-8116-e4082f49cd44",nt"extras":
