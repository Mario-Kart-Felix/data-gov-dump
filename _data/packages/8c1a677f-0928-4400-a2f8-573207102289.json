	"notes": "Abstract: The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) is a sensor carried n                onboard Landsats 4 and 5 and has acquired images of the Earth nearly n                continuously from July 1982 to the present, with a 16-day repeat cycle.n                Landsat TM image data consist of seven spectral bands (band designations) with a n                spatial resolution of 30 meters for bands 1 to 5 and band 7. Spatial resolution for n                band 6 (thermal infrared) is 120 meters, but band 6 data are oversampled to 30 n                meter pixel size. Approximate scene size is 170 km north-south by 183 km n                east-west (106 mi by 114 mi). n                Systematic Correction (Level 1G) includes both radiometric and geometric correction. n                The scene will be rotated, aligned, and georeferenced to a user-specified map n                projection. Absolute geometric accuracy of the systematically corrected Landsat n                TM product can vary, depending on the accuracy of the predicted ephemeris that n                is used for processing. Please be aware that TM Level 1G products may require n                additional image geometric correction and/or co-registration to known ground n                control points (GCPs). n                Precision Correction (Level 1P) includes radiometric and geometric correction, as n                well as the use of ground control points (GCPs) to improve geometric accuracy. For n                locations outside the United States, accuracy of the precision-corrected product will n                depend on the availability of local GCPs. n                Terrain Correction (Level 1T) includes radiometric and geometric precision n                correction, as well as the use of a digital elevation model (DEM) to improve the n                satellite model and to correct for relief displacement caused by local terrain. For n                locations outside the United States, the accuracy of a terrain-corrected product will n                depend on the availability of local ground control points (GCPs), as well as the n                quality of the best available DEM.

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
