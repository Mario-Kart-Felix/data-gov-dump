    resolution bathymetry (sun illuminated with azimuth 225 and incline 45) of the north
    shore of St. Croix, US Virgin Islands.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team and
    NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory,
    federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the
    US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted
    Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor
    using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound
    velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved
    tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The processed
    CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface -akin to a DTM- based on swath
    angle with footprint size 3*3. Within CARIS, an imagery file with associated georeferencing
    was then exported from the BASE surface.While the project was conducted to meet
    IHO Order 2 accuracy standards, there is a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in
    the dataset that the user should take into consideration when performing any analysis.",nt"owner_org":
