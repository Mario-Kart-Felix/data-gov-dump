	"notes": "This Phase I program proposes to synthesize novel nanoengineered ultra low out gassing elastomers and formulate high temperature capable flexible thermal control coatings as well as adhesives based on the proposed chemistries that are stable in various space environments. We have envisioned nano-engineered clusters and the innovative synthesis of the poly carborane-polysiloxanes, to surpass the performance of the current state of the art and provide the formulations that are space environment stable and can provide radiation hardening and enhanced life long survivability for science mission hardware in space environments. We propose to investigate: (1) Synthesis of high molecular weight ultra low outgassing poly-carborane-siloxanes that are stable and demonstrate for temperatures &amp;#8805; 500&amp;#61616;C. (2) Use of nano-engineered clusters with appropriate cross linker chemistries for tailoring secondary emission properties while providing protection from the irradiation using electron donor compounds. This can help us to employ electron on demand strategy to mitigate the secondary and sustained arcs. (3) Investigations in to: thermal stability thermally induced out-gassing studies, ESD behavior, and space environment simulation of elastomers for the typical GEO and LEO scenarios. These results from this study will guide us to select the promising formulations for the scale up and validation studies in Phase II. Lastly, we have proposed investigations in Boron Nitride Self Assembled Nano Cluster Mesh (BN-SANCs&lt;SUP&gt;TM&lt;/SUP&gt;), which may totally change the way we formulate the space stable thermal control material systems for all earth orbits and planetary environment, along with its use in radiation shielding with use of 10BN-SANCs&lt;SUP&gt;TM&lt;/SUP&gt;.

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
