	"notes": "Over the course of the entire project, field visits were made to 117 geothermal systems in the Great Basin region. Major field excursions, incorporating visits to large groups of systems, were conducted in western Nevada, central Nevada, northwestern Nevada, northeastern Nevada, eastu2010central Nevada, eastern California, southern Oregon, and western Utah. For example, field excursions to the following areas included visits of multiple geothermal systems:n- Northwestern Nevada: Baltazor Hot Spring, Blue Mountain, Bog Hot Spring, Dyke Hot Springs, Howard Hot Spring, MacFarlane Hot Spring, McGee Mountain, and Pinto Hot Springs in northwest Nevada.n- Northu2010central to northeastern Nevada: Beowawe, Crescent Valley (Hot Springs Point), Dann Ranch (Handu2010meu2010Down Hot Springs), Golconda, and Pumpernickel Valley (Tipton Hot Springs) in northu2010central to northeast Nevada.n- Eastern Nevada: Ash Springs, Chimney Hot Spring, Duckwater, Hiko Hot Spring, Hot Creek Butte, Iverson Spring, Moon River Hot Spring, Moorman Spring, Railroad Valley, and Williams Hot Spring in eastern Nevada.n- Southwestern Nevadau2010eastern California: Walleyu2019s Hot Spring, Antelope Valley, Fales Hot Springs, Buckeye Hot Springs, Travertine Hot Springs, Teels Marsh, Rhodes Marsh, Columbus Marsh, Alumu2010Silver Peak, Fish Lake Valley, Gabbs Valley, Wild Rose, Rawhideu2010 Wedell Hot Springs, Alkali Hot Springs, and Baileys/Hicks/Burrell Hot Springs.n- Southern Oregon: Alvord Hot Spring, Antelope Hot Springu2010Hart Mountain, Borax Lake, Crump Geyser, and Mickey Hot Spring in southern Oregon.n- Western Utah: Newcastle, Veyo Hot Spring, Dixie Hot Spring, Thermo, Roosevelt, Cove Fort, Red Hill Hot Spring, Joseph Hot Spring, Hatton Hot Spring, and Abrahamu2010Baker Hot Springs.nnStructural controls of 426 geothermal systems were analyzed with literature research, air photos, googleu2010Earth imagery, and/or field reviews (Figures 1 and 2). Of the systems analyzed, we were able to determine the structural settings of more than 240 sites. However, we found that many u201csystemsu201d consisted of little more than a warm or hot well in the central part of a basin. Such u201csystemsu201d were difficult to evaluate in terms of structural setting in areas lacking in geophysical data.nnDeveloped database for structural catalogue in a master spreadsheet. Data components include structural setting, primary fault orientation, presence or absence of Quaternary faulting, reservoir lithology, geothermometry, presence or absence of recent magmatism, and distinguishing blind systems from those that have surface expressions.nnReviewed site locations for all 426 geothermal systemsu2013 Confirmed and/or relocated spring and geothermal sites based on imagery, maps, and other information for master database. Many systems were mislocated in the original database. In addition, some systems that included several separate springs spread over large areas were divided into two or more distinct systems. Further, all hot wells were assigned names based on their location to facilitate subsequent analyses.nWe catalogued systems into the following eight major groups, based on the dominant pattern of faulting (Figure 1):n- Major normal fault segments (i.e., near displacement maxima).n- Fault bends.n- Fault terminations or tips.n- Stepu2010overs or relay ramps in normal faults.n- Fault intersections.n- Accommodation zones (i.e., belts of intermeshing oppositely dipping normal faults),n- Displacement transfer zones whereby strikeu2010slip faults terminate in arrays of normal faults.n- Transtensional pullu2010aparts.nnThese settings form a hierarchal pattern with respect to fault complexity.n- Major normal faults and fault bends are the simplest.n- Fault terminations are typically more complex than midu2010segments, as faults commonly break up into multiple strands or horsetail near their ends.n- A fault intersection is generally more complex, as it generally contains both multiple fault strands and can include discrete dilational quadrants.n- A stepu2010over consists of two overlapping fault terminations and thus involves additional complexity, especially where the relay ramp is breached by multiple fault splays between the main overlapping faults and thus contains multiple fault intersections.n- Accommodation zones involve further complexity, as they contain multiple fault terminations and fault intersections.nnOf the 426 fields analyzed, major findings include (Figures 1 and 2):n- 39% of the known systems are blind or hidden (Figure 1), with no surface hot springs or fumaroles.n- The structural setting for ~25% of the systems could not be determined (Figure 2). In most cases, undetermined systems reside in the central part of a basin (commonly warm wells) that lacks adequate geophysical data for elucidating the subsurface structure.n- Stepu2010overs or relay ramps in normal faults are the most favorable setting (Figure 2), hosting ~32% of the systems analyzed. Such areas are characterized by multiple, commonly overlapping fault strands, increased fracture density, and thus enhanced permeability.n- Normal fault terminations host 25%.n- Intersections of normal faults and strikeu2010slip or obliqueu2010slip faults host 22%.n- Accommodation zones (belts of intermeshing oppositely dipping normal faults) host 9%.n- Displacement transfer zones host 5%.n- Pullu2010aparts in strikeu2010slip faults host 3%.n- Bends in major normal faults host 2%.n- Major rangeu2010front faults host 1% of the known systems.nSome of the more robust systems contain more than one type of structural setting. These include Steamboat, Coso, and Dixie Valley. About 21% of the fields are hybrid or compound systems.nnPullu2010aparts and displacement transfer zones are more abundant in the transtensional western part of the Great Basin.nnAn analysis of the relations between Quaternary faulting and geothermal systems was completed for the Great Basin region. The 426 localities were overlain on USGS Quaternary fault database in GoogleEarth to evaluate proximity to mapped faults and look for unrecognized faults.n- Quaternary faults typically lie within or near most of the geothermal systems.n- Geothermal fields were evaluated with proximity to Quaternary faults classified in 4 categories: <1 km, 1u20102 km, 1u20105 km, 1u201010 km.n- Fault ages were classified as historical, Holocene, late Pleistocene, midu2010Pleistocene, and Quaternary undivided.n- The highest percentage of highu2010temp sites are within 2 km of Quaternary faults. This suggests a statistical correlation between proximity to active faults and highu2010temp resources.nnGeothermal systems are rare along major rangeu2010front faults, possibly due to both reduced permeability in thick zones of clay gouge and periodic release of stress in major earthquakes.nnStepu2010overs, terminations, intersections, and accommodation zones correspond to longu2010term, critically stressed areas, where fluid pathways would more likely remain open in networks of closelyu2010spaced, brecciau2010dominated fractures.n",
