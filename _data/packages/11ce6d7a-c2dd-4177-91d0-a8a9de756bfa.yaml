    in 2010, and a final report was submitted to NASA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
    purpose of this investigation was to quantify the joint kinematics and kinetics
    that occur during squat and deadlift exercise on the ARED to inform a future proposal
    that will include a biomechanical analysis of exercise on the ISS. Six subjects
    (3m/3f) were tested while performing single legged squats, normal squats, increased
    range of motion squats, wide stance squats, fast squats, reduced range of motion
    squats, normal deadlift, and sumo deadlift. Ground reaction force (GRF) and motion
    capture data were collected as each subject performed a single repetition using
    a load that approximated their 10 repetition maximum. Testing loads were determined
    during an earlier training session. Three dimensional joint kinematics and kinetics
    were computed using a standard inverse dynamics approach. GRF data indicated that
    peak loads were dependent upon exercise type and that the peak GRF did not always
    occur at the same time during a repetition depending upon the exercise. Bilateral
    joint kinematics were generally symmetrical; however, hip adduction and rotation
    displayed increased bilateral asymmetry. Joint kinetics differed between exercise
    types although there were no specific trends across all variables. In general during
    the downward motion, work was performed on the hip and knee extensors for all exercises,
    and work was performed by the hip and knee extensors during the upward motion. Positive
    and negative work for hip adduction/abduction, hip internal/external rotation, and
    ankle flexion varied across exercises. Bilateral joint kinetics were asymmetrical,
    which may reflect a property of ARED that needs further study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based
    on our results, we suggest that the exercises included in a future flight study
    include, along with the justification:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1)
    Normal Squat: A baseline measure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2)
    Single Legged Squat: Increased net hip torque and only exercise inducing hip adduction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3)
    Wide Normal Squat: Hip adduction and rotation kinematics suggest femoral head loading
    differences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) Normal Deadlift: Baseline
    measure, but with different kinematics than the squat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore,
    we suggest the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Increasing
    the subject size of the current study to allow for standard statistical analyses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2)
    Retest of current subjects bilateral symmetry using a free weight condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3)
    Further study of the FS condition relative to free weights to better understand
    joint kinetic differences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although
    IR squats had larger kinetic values than others, variation was also increased because
    of between subject differences. We did not recommend this lift because of the larger
    subject variation, but this lift should also be considered in a future study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
