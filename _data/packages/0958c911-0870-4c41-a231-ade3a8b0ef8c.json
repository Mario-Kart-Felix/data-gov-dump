	"notes": "This Phase I SBIR program will result in the application and characterization of highly conductive, inexpensive, nanostructured textiles and composites for ultra lightweight, low-volume antenna applications. Metal Rubber&lt;SUP&gt;TM&lt;/SUP&gt; is a highly successful product for NanoSonic and has tested well for microwave applications; it has now been extended to similar textile based conductive materials. In this effort, these materials would be characterized and assembled into composites. In Phase II and beyond, the materials would be used to construct antennas with applications intended as deployable, conformal antenna systems for NASA platforms. Although this mesh material could be easily incorporated into reflector design, primary emphasis will be on the construction of mesh patch antennas in the L-band. This is convenient for ease of construction but would also serve the NASA by extending the application of larger aperture radar. Additionally, these materials would easily be extended into lower bands for terrestrial and higher bands for spaceborne applications. In order to design the antennas, NanoSonic will work with a major research university that is a world leader in computational electromagnetics. Additionally, NanoSonic will work with a major NASA prime contractor that has direct ties to multiple NASA platforms. ",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
