    Refuge Master Plan and  Environmental Assessment. It replaces the former Master
    Plan Technical  Report that was prepared in March 1965. The major purpose of this
    report is to update refuge objectives in accordance with a more current assessment
    of refuge resource capabilities and changes in applicable laws and policies affecting
    management of the National Wildlife Refuge System. It should be noted that this
    Master Plan updating process was well along and many of the planning materials prepared
    prior to completion and issuance to the field of the Master Planning Workbook for
    the Refuge System in August 1980. While we have made an effort to integrate the
    results of our earlier planning efforts into the procedures outlined in the Workbook,
    the format of our plan and planning materials is not the same in all cases. The
    report also outlines in general terms the long-range management strategy that will
    be used in fulfilling revised refuge objectives. This is, by definition, a narrative
    statement of the management and development activities required to implement decisions
    made in master planning. It serves as the principle guide for developing detailed,
     short-term refuge management and operational plans. Three alternative levels of
    management and associated strategies were developed and presented in this plan:
    No Funds Increase, Custodial Maintenance, and the Preferred Alternative. The Preferred
    Alternative management strategy is the alternative the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service
    feels would best satisfy wildlife resource and public needs, while remaining consistent
    with legal mandates, national direction, and the resource capabilities of the Refuge.
    The Preferred Alternative is based on the assumption that funding will be available
    to permit a refuge operation that will ultimately produce the desired objective
    levels. Management would be directed at preserving natural environments of the refuge,
    maintaining aesthetic qualities, emphasizing habitat diversity, introducing native
    flora and fauna, maintaining an optimum mix of compatible public uses, and completing
    acquisition of about 3,681 acres of privately owned and 5,009 acres of public land
    adjacent or within the boundary of the refuge, on a willing seller or exchange basis.
    The Preferred Alternative follows a comprehensive management approach, which prescribes
    that the Fish and Wildlife Service has an active interest and responsibility in
    helping to preserve the migratory bird habitat associated with the entire Harney
    Basin. That responsibility recognizes the important role off-refuge lands play in
    support of total migratory bird habitat values of the Basin. Under this alternative,
    use of livestock grazing, haying, prescribed burning, and other necessary management
    tools will be made, as appropriate to the needs of refuge habitats and animal population
    management programs. The draft plan was released for public review and comment during
    the summer of 1983. Copies were distributed to Federal, State and local agencies,
    a wide variety of environmental groups, and local citizens. This final version was
    revised to address the comments and suggestions received from the public. Five written
    comments were received. All supported the Preferred Alternative. As outlined in
    4 RM 3, following the completion of the Master Plan, the refuge management planning
    process will move on to the development of unit-specific objectives and strategies.
    During this effort, master plan objectives and strategies will be matched to the
    innate potential of each unit to provide the optimum mix of outputs. Specific plans
    for comprehensive habitat, water, and public use management, will be developed as
    appropriate.",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras":
