    to Learn Television program! Ready to Learn Television supports the development
    of educational television and digital media targeted at preschool and early elementary
    school children and their families. Its general goal is to promote early learning
    and school readiness, with a particular interest in reaching low-income children.
    In addition to creating television and other media products, the program supports
    activities intended to promote national distribution of the programming, effective
    educational uses of the programming, community-based outreach, and research on educational
    effectiveness. You can use the tools below to look at general information about
    the grant applications that were submitted in June 2010. There were a total of 38
    eligible applications, of which three were selected for funding. In this 2010 competition,
    applicants were invited to submit proposals for the development of innovative transmedia
    programming - that is, the use of television and other media such as the internet,
    mobile devices, and print in interconnected ways. In the 2010 grant competition,
    there was a two-tier review process in which the applications that scored the highest
    against the program's general review criteria were advanced to a second tier in
    which their responses to the competitive preference priority on research were scored.
    In the data summaries below, applicants that advanced to tier two are denoted as
    "highly rated applicants," and those that received awards are listed as "grantees".
    The data presented here is sourced from the applications submitted to the program.
    The data may not be a full representation of the information provided in the formal
    application. Inclusion of an application in this summary information is not an endorsement
    of an organization, idea, program, or product, and the Department does not validate
    or guarantee the accuracy of this information. The data are provided in this summary
    solely for the convenience of the public. For more information about the Ready to
    Learn program, go to http://www2.ed.gov/programs/rtltv/index.html.",nt"license_title":
