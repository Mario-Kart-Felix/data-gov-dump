WMAs are part of the Minnesota state recreation system created to protect wildlife habitat and provide wildlife-based recreation. Facilities and features are labeled based on a hierarchical classification system developed by the MN DNR, Section of Wildlife. Several examples of features that may be represented as points include parking lots, water access, signs, gates, bridges, camping facilities, blinds, water control structures, feeding structures, nesting and breeding structures, buildings, reference points and cultural features. Disclaimer: The only features in this theme are WMA user facilities such as parking lots, water accesses, trails and blinds. WMA management facilities such as water control structures, restricted roads, gates and habitat structures have been removed from this layer.",
