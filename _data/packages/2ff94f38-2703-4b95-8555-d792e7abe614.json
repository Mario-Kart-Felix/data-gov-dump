	"notes": "This data set provides estimates of above- and below-ground biomass, above- and below-ground NPP (ANPP and BNPP), and total NPP(TNPP) for selected North American and Eurasian boreal forests located between 66.37 degrees N and 47.5 degrees N. Each stand was selected through a review of published literature and classified into one of three classes, depending upon completeness of NPP budget, ancillary site data, and stand information. Within the overall 1965-1995 temporal range, data available for individual sites varies widely.There are two ASCII files (comma-separated-value format) of NPP data.tThe first file provides carbon distribution in above- and below-ground vegetation biomass, above- and below-ground net primary production, and mean annual biomass increment for twenty-four (24) Class I sites which have complete NPP budgets (ANPP + BNPP). Information about site characteristics and NPP measurement approaches are also provided.tThe second file provides stand information, carbon distribution in above-ground vegetation biomass, and ANPP data for forty-five (45) Class II boreal forest stands that have incomplete NPP budgets. Revision Notes:Above- and below-ground biomass, ANPP, and TNPP values for several sites have been corrected to agree with primary published sources and related data sets. The temporal coverage for both has been corrected to agree with primary published sources. Please see the Data Set Revision section of this document for detailed information.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
