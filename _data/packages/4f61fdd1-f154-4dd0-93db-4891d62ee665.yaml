    & Ranging) 3x3 meter resolution bathymetric surface for an area including and surrounding
    Buck Island Reef National Monument (BUIS), St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands
    (USVI). The image's horizontal coordinate system is NAD83 UTM 20 North, and depth
    values are in meters referenced to Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) heights. Fugro LADS,
    in collaboration with NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, the University
    of New Hampshire and the National Park Service, acquired bathymetry, relative seafloor
    reflectivity and hyperspectral imagery in St. Croix from 2/21 to 2/22/2011. Hyperspectral
    data were acquired using a Hyspex VNIR-1600 sensor. Bathymetry and reflectivity
    data were acquired using a LADS (Laser Airborne Depth Sounder) Mark II Airborne
    System from altitudes between 1,200 and 2,200ft at ground speeds between 140 and
    175 knots. The 900 Hertz Nd: YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet) laser
    (1064 nm) acquired 3x3 meter spot spacing and 200% seabed coverage. In total, 35.9
    square kilometers of LiDAR were collected between 0 m and 49 m in depth. Environmental
    factors such as wind strength and direction, cloud cover, water clarity and depth
    influenced the area of data acquisition on a daily basis. The data was processed
    using the LADS Mark II Ground System and data visualization, quality control and
    final products were created using CARIS HIPS and SIPS and CARIS BASE Editor. All
    users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their
    own needs and standards.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
