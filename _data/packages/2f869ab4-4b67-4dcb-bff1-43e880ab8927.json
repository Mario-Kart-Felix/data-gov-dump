	"notes": "Smart materials control of aero-surfaces based on shape memory alloysn(SMA) is seeing increased use for improving of future subsonic fixednwing aircraft aero-surface controls. Such SMA actuators have thenpotential of lowering weight and increasing reliability through directncontrol. The binary NiTi system has been a preferred system but thesenalloys have austenite finish Af transition temperature in a reportednrange of 90 - 100C, which is too low for many applications. Therefore,nthere is strong interest in developing a class of ternary and/ornquaternary alloys that incorporate Pd and/or other elemental additions.nMRi is proposing to develop NiTiPd and NiTiPd+ X alloys that are capablenof being directly formed via vacuum plasma spray (VPS) processing. Thesenalloys have been shown to increase Af transformation temperature to overn350C, however, these alloys are also significantly less ductile and morenprone to casting segregation. The proposed innovation has the potentialnto eliminate the typical cast/rolling/extrusion procedures typicallynused with NiTi alloys with a near-net vacuum plasma spray (VPS) formingnprocess. If successful, the alloy and process development work to benconducted on the Phase I investigation would enable the VPS process tondirectly form shapes from NiTiPd-X alloys. The proposed Phase I researchnwould be aimed at developing specific NiTiPd+X where X could be Hf, Zrnand even B. The development work would focus on developing as depositednstructures that would yield Af transition temperature from 130 - 300C.nIf successful, the development would enable the cost effectivenmanufacture of higher temperature shape memory alloy actuators for usenas remote actuation of aero-control surface and engine controls.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
