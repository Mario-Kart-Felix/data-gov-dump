    are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census
    Bureau'sn               Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
    Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specificallyn
                  designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization
    is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships amongn               geographies
    and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year.
    Geographic areas may not align with the same areas fromn               another year.
    Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available
    only as state-based files. Census tracts are small,n               relatively permanent
    statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local
    participants as part of the 2010 Censusn               Participant Statistical Areas
    Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local
    participant existed or where all then               potential participants declined
    to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set
    of geographic units for the presentationn               of census data and comparison
    back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size
    between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with ann               optimum size of 4,000 people.
    When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect
    to population characteristics, economicn               status, and living conditions.
    The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.
    Physical changes in streetn               patterns caused by highway construction,
    new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census
    tracts occasionally are splitn               due to population growth, or combined
    as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally
    follow visible and identifiablen               features. They may follow legal boundaries
    such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States
    and situations to allow forn               census tract-to-governmental unit relationships
    where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State
    and county boundariesn               always are census tract boundaries in the standard
    census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist
    of noncontiguousn               areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where
    the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves
    noncontiguous.n               For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of
    9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American
    Indian populationn               according to Census 2000 data and/or their area
    was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or
    off-reservation trustn               lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was
    enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented
    a relatively largen               special land use area such as a National Park,
    military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through
    9998 was enforcedn               for those census tracts that contained only water
    area, no land area.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
