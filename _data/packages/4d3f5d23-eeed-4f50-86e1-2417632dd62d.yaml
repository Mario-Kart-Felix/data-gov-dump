    backscatter mosaic of the north shore (Salt River) of St. Croix, US Virgin Islands.
    NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy
    Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry
    data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted
    Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor
    using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound
    velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved
    tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The backscatter
    component of the bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected
    using Geocoder 2.8 software. Acoustic backscatter mosaics are ostensibly an important
    piece of information when characterizing surficial seafloor features and delineating
    benthic habitats. The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards,
    dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate
    the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards",nt"owner_org":
