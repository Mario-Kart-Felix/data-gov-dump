    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "A method has been developed for prognostication
    of accrued prior damage in electronics subjected to overlapping sequential environments
    of thermal aging and thermal cycling. The presented approach uses the LM Algorithm
    in conjunction with microstructural evolution of damage based leading indi- cator
    for estimating prior stress history. Specific damage proxies examined include the
    phase-growth indicator and the IMC thickness. The viability of the approach has
    been demonstrated for leadfree test assemblies subjected to thermal aging at 125
    u00b0C and redeployed in cyclic thermo-mechanical environment u221255u2013125 u00b0C.
    Damage equivalency relationships between thermal aging during storage life and the
    resulting reduction in thermo-mechanical reliability in cyclic thermal environments
    during field deployment has been derived and validated based on two damage proxies.
    Convergence of the damage mapping to a common solution from data based on the two
    separate leading indicators has been demonstrated. Assemblies subjected to sequential
    stresses have been prog- nosticated for accrued damage from sequential overlapping
    stresses of thermal aging and thermal cycling. Correlation between the prognosticated
    damage and the actual accrued damage demonstrates that the proposed approach can
    be used to assess damage accrued under overlapping thermo- mechanical stresses of
    thermal aging and thermal cycling. In addition, prognostics metrics have been used
    to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the prognostic algorithms using both
    the leading indicators. Results demonstrate that both damage proxies work well in
    estimating accrued damage and estimating residual life.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
