	"notes": "&lt;p&gt;Documentation and Development: The AMP was initially being developed as part the Advanced Integrated Clinical System (AICS)-Guided Medical Procedure System for the Constellation Program. The Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) team generated an Operational Concept (OpsCon) document and, subsequently, a set of functional and technical requirements. All of these documents were reviewed and approved by the Johnson Space Center Space Medicine Configuration Control Board in 2009 and 2010, respectively. These documents were then archived when the Constellation Program was canceled in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiscal Year 2012 (FY12) brought the start of the EMSD project and the initial development of the AMP. ExMC generated a new OpsCon document for the AMP to reflect how it would be used for the EMSD. This document was approved by the ExMC Advisory Board and then used to generate functional and technical requirements. These requirements were reviewed by the ExMC Advisory Board and during the EMSD&amp;rsquo;s System Requirements Review in March 2012. The ExMC Team then used the finalized requirements to determine that a product made by software developers within NASA was applicable. The product, a system called WebPD, has architecture relevant to the EMSD project and is being modified for integration with potential EMSD components. The approach for modifying and integrating the AMP into the EMSD was finalized during the EMSD Preliminary Design Review in June 2013. The AMP, along with other EMSD components, is being prepared for the ground phase of the EMSD, which is currently set for June 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The work by the ExMC team over the past year has enabled them to (1) identify a software system that can be modified to become the AMP system for the EMSD and (2) begin modifying the AMP for integration with other EMSD components. This work immediately addresses CPR Risks #17 and #23 and enables ExMC to better address CPR Risks #17, #20, #22, and #23 in the coming fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objectives for FY14 are to (1) generate the first iteration of the AMP and (2) conduct an evaluation of this AMP&amp;rsquo;s capability in an analog environment that mimics an exploration-class mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
