	"notes": "This data set provides estimates of monthly carbon dioxide (CO2) flux from the Amazon mainstem rivers, tributary stream networks, and their associated varzeas (floodplains). CO2 flux was calculated using two aggregation approaches: for defined river basins (data file #2) and for defined river reaches (figure 2). Flux was calculated from (1) estimated surface water area by month for the Amazon mainstem rivers, associated varzeas, and tributary stream networks, (2) mean daily partial pressures of CO2 (pCO2) concentrations for the mainstem rivers, and (3) calculated mean pCO2 values for the varzea waters. Mean monthly discharge data for 11 mainstem rivers are also included. There are five comma-delimited data files with this data set. Amazon mainstem is a region covering the Amazon/Solimoes River mainstem from 70 degrees W to 54 degrees W. Data from the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-1 (JERS-1) L-band synthetic aperture radar were used to estimate the areal coverage and inundation status of rivers and floodplains over 100 m in width and compiled into mosaics for periods of high and low  water.  For each mosaic, the study area was classified into either flooded or non-flooded areas. Data for the seasonal and spatial distributions of pCO2 within each hydrographic region were utilized from over 1,800 samples taken on 13 Carbon in the Amazon River Experiment (CAMREX) expeditions at different water stages throughout a 2,000 km reach of the central Amazon mainstem, tributary, and floodplain waters (Degens et al., 1991, Devol et al., 1995, Richey et al., 1988).",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
