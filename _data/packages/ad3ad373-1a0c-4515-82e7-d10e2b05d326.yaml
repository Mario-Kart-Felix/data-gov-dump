    where species are predicted to occur based on habitat associations. GAP distribution
    models are the spatial arrangement of environments suitable for occupation by a
    species. In other words, a species distribution is created using a deductive model
    to predict areas suitable for occupation within a species range. To represent these
    suitable environments, GAP compiled existing GAP data, where available, and compiled
    additional data where needed. Existing data sources were the Southwest Regional
    Gap Analysis Project (SWReGAP) and the Southeast Gap Analysis Project (SEGAP) as
    well as a data compiled by Sanborn Solutions and Mason, Bruce and Girard. Habitat
    associations were based on land cover data of ecological systems and--when applicable
    for the given taxon--on ancillary variables such as elevation, hydrologic characteristics,
    human avoidance characteristics, forest edge, ecotone widths, etc. Distribution
    models were generated using a python script that selects model variables based on
    literature cited information stored in a wildlife habitat relationship database
    (WHRdb); literature used includes primary and gray publications. Distribution models
    are 30 meter raster data and delimited by GAP species ranges. Distribution model
    data were attributed with information regarding seasonal use based on GAP regional
    projects (NWGAP, SWReGAP, SEGAP, AKGAP, HIGAP, PRGAP, and USVIGAP), NatureServe
    data, and IUCN data. A full report documenting the parameters used in each species
    model can be found via: http://gis1.usgs.gov/csas/gap/viewer/species/Map.aspx Web
    map services for species distribution models can be accessed from: http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Birds

    of GAP's available web map services can be found here: http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/species/data/web-map-services/
    GAP used the best information available to create these species distribution models;
    however GAP seeks to improve and update these data as new information becomes available.

    the data in some way. It is also strongly recommended that careful attention be
    paid to the contents of the metadata file associated with these data. The U.S. Geological
    Survey shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data described
    and/or contained herein. All information is created with a specific end use or uses
    in mind. This is especially true for GIS data, which is expensive to produce and
    must be directed to meet the immediate program needs. However, these data were created
    with the expectation that they would be used for other applications; therefore,
    we list below both appropriate and inappropriate uses. This list is in no way exhaustive
    but should serve as a guide to assess whether a proposed use can or cannot be supported
    by these data. For many uses, it is unlikely that GAP's species range data will
    provide the only data needed, and for uses with a regulatory outcome, field surveys
    should verify the result. In the end, it will be the responsibility of each data
    user to determine if these data can answer the question being asked, and if they
    are the best tool to answer that question. While it is impossible to predict all
    the uses of these data we have listed several possible appropriate and inappropriate
    uses from GAP's perspective. All data are provided as is without warranty as to
    its currency, completeness, or accuracy of any specific data. NatureServe hereby

    data provided are for planning, assessment, and informational purposes. The information
    provided is not a survey quality dataset. This disclaimer applies both to individual
    use of the data and aggregate use with other data. Appropriate uses of the data:
    primarily as a coarse map for a large area such as a county or to provide context
    for finer-level maps. A general list of possible applications include: -National,
    regional or statewide biodiversity planning -National, Regional or state habitat
    conservation planning -County comprehensive planning -Large-area resource management
    planning -Coarse-filter evaluation of potential impacts or benefits of major projects
    or plan initiatives on biodiversity, such as utility or transportation corridors,
    wilderness proposals, habitat connectivity proposals, climate change adaption proposals,
    regional open space and recreation proposals, etc. -Determining relative amounts
    of management responsibility for specific biological resources among land stewards
    to facilitate cooperative management and planning. -Basic research on regional distributions
    of plants and animals and to help target both specific species and geographic areas
    for needed research. -Environmental impact assessment for large projects or military
    activities. -Estimation of potential economic impacts from loss of biological resource-based
    activities. -Education at all levels and for both students and citizens. Inappropriate
    Uses: It is far easier to identify appropriate uses than inappropriate ones, however,
    there is a "fuzzy line" that is eventually crossed when the differences in resolution
    of the data, size of geographic area being analyzed, and precision of the answer
    required for the question are no longer compatible. Examples include: -Using the
    data to map small areas (less than thousands of hectares), typically requiring mapping
    resolution at 1:24,000 scale and using aerial photographs or ground surveys. -Combining
    these data with other data finer than 1:100,000 scale to produce new hybrid maps
    or answer queries. -Generating specific areal measurements from the data finer than
    the nearest thousand hectares -Establishing exact boundaries for regulation or acquisition.
    -Establishing definite occurrence or non-occurrence of any feature for an exact
    geographic area -Determining abundance, health, or condition of any feature. -Establishing
    a measure of accuracy of any other data by comparison with GAP data. -Altering the
    data in any way and redistributing them as a GAP data product. -Using the data without
    acquiring and reviewing the metadata and this report.", "Access Constraints: These
