	"notes": "The Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS, MISR and SeaWiFS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data sets represent a series of three-year running mean grids (1998-2012) of fine nnparticulate matter (solid particles and liquid droplets) that were derived from a combination of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), MISR (Multi-angle Imaging nnSpectroRadiometer) and SeaWIFS (Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor) AOD satellite retrievals. Together the grids provide a continuous surface of concentrations in micrograms per cubic nnmeter of particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM2.5) for health and environmental research. For each satellite-derived PM2.5 source, the total column retrievals of AOD were nnconverted to near-ground PM2.5 levels using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to represent local relationships between AOD and PM2.5. A global decadal (2001-2010) mean PM2.5 nnconcentration grid was also produced. The raster grids have a grid cell resolution of 6 arc-minutes (0.1 degree or approximately 10 km at the equator) and cover the global land surface from nn70 degrees north to 55 degrees south. Compared to SEDACu2019s earlier data set, Global Annual Average PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), v1 (2001-2010), this data set nnprovides higher accuracy; longer temporal range; higher resolution (0.1 x 0.1 degrees); and time varying AOD to PM2.5 relationships, necessary for appropriate representation of nntrends.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
