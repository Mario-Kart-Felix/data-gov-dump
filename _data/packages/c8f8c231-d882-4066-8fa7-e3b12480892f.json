	"notes": "Wireless, passive, Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW), Orthogonal FrequencynCoded (OFC) temperature sensors, operating in a multi-sensornenvironment, developed at the University of Central Florida (UCF) havenbeen successfully interrogated wirelessly at a distances ranging from 7nto 21 feet with a transceiver system developed by Mnemonics, Inc (MNI).nThe proposed innovation adds a coherent detection capability to theninterrogator receiver, allowing the phase of the received signal to benmeasured.  As is done in GPS signal processing, the phase informationnallows precise measurement of range (from the interrogator to sensor) asnwell as motion, and if multiple antennas are used, angle of arrivaln(i.e. direction) can also be sensed.   The investigation will includenoptimizing waveforms for the new measurement capabilities and willnextend the detection range well beyond the 21 feet.  Other objectivesnare to develop a compact integrated sensor and antenna, synchronizentiming and phase in a multiple interrogator network and improve RFnperformance on both the transmit and receive side of the interrogator.nThe proposed interrogator is based on a quadrature receiver techniquenand will also include wireless backhaul for instantaneous distributionnof measurement data. The proposed interrogator and SAW sensors are tonoperate at the 915 MHz frequency band.  The proposed system will be usednin a broad range of NASA, as well as commercial applications.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
