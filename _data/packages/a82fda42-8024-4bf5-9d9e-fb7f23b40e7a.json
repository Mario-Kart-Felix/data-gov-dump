	"notes": " The Feature Names Relationship Filen               (FEATNAMES.dbf) contains a record for each feature name and any attributes associatedn               with it. Each feature name can be linked to the corresponding edges that make up thatn               feature in the All Lines Shapefile (EDGES.shp), where applicable to the correspondingn               address range or ranges in the Address Ranges Relationship File (ADDR.dbf), or ton               both files. Although this file includes feature names for all linear features, notn               just road features, the primary purpose of this relationship file is to identify alln               street names associated with each address range. An edge can have several featuren               names; an address range located on an edge can be associated with one or anyn               combination of the available feature names (an address range can be linked ton               multiple feature names). The address range is identified by the address rangen               identifier (ARID) attribute, which can be used to link to the Address Rangesn               Relationship File (ADDR.dbf). The linear feature is identified by the linear featuren               identifier (LINEARID) attribute, which can be used to relate the address range backn               to the name attributes of the feature in the Feature Names Relationship File or ton               the feature record in the Primary Roads, Primary and Secondary Roads, or All Roadsn               Shapefiles. The edge to which a feature name applies can be determined by linking then               feature name record to the All Lines Shapefile (EDGES.shp) using the permanent edgen               identifier (TLID) attribute. The address range identifier(s) (ARID) for a specificn               linear feature can be found by using the linear feature identifier (LINEARID) fromn               the Feature Names Relationship File (FEATNAMES.dbf) through the Address Range /n               Feature Name Relationship File (ADDRFN.dbf).
