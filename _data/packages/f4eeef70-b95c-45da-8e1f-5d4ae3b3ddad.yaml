    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate

    data product (HIRDLS2) contains an entire day's worth of Level-2 vertical profiles
    of O3, HNO3, H2O, CFC-11, CFC-12, N2O, NO2, N2O5, ClONO2, temperature, geopotential
    height, and aerosol extinction at 12.1 and 8.3 microns, as well as cloud top pressure.
    The HIRDLS2 data are provided on 24 levels per decade of pressure corresponding
    to about 1 km vertical resolution. The vertical range of the data depends on the
    measured species. The current and final version of this product is 7. Of the original
    targeted species, only CH4 was not retrieved in this version.nnThe data are stored
    in the version 5 Hierarchical Data Format for the Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS5),
    which is an extension of the HDF5 format. Each file contains a single swath object
    with one day of data (measured species and species precision), geolocation fields
    (e.g. time, latitude, longitude, pressure), and swath attributes, along with file
    level metadata. Each file contains approximately 5600 profile scans. Time stamps
    are in TAI-93 format (seconds since January 1, 1993) as well as in seconds since
    start of day. Arrays with missing data are set to a constant fill value (-999.0).
    nnThe High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS) aboard the EOS Aura spacecraft
    was launched July 15, 2004. The instrument was designed to scan the Earth limb at
    multiple azimuth angles, measuring infrared emissions in 21 channels ranging from
    6.12 to 17.76 microns in the upper troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere. On
    July 30, 2004 when the instrument was switched on, it was discovered that a piece
    of plastic film was blocking most of the HIRDLS scanning mirror. Only a small portion
    of the mirror at the far azimuth scan (away from the sun side) was clear for making
    observations of the Earth's atmosphere. Several attempts to remove the blockage
    were unsuccessful. This obstruction resulted in limited data coverage between -64
    and +82 degrees latitude, and thus excluded observations over the Antarctic region.
    The first reliable data are from January 29, 2005, earlier data from January 21
    to 28 are of substandard quality and are not included in version 7. From January
    3 to March 17, 2008 the chopper frequency became erratic, and data for these days
    should be used with caution. The HIRDLS instrument remained operational until March
    17, 2008 when the chopper stalled.nnParameters contained in the data files include
