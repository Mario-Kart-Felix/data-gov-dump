    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The 1906 San Francisco earthquake was the
    largest event (magnitude 8.3) to occur in the conterminous United States in the
    20th Century. Recent estimates indicate that as many as 3,000 people lost their
    lives in the earthquake and ensuing fire. In terms of 1906 dollars, the total property
    damage amounted to about $24 million from the earthquake and $350 million from the
    fire. The fire destroyed 28,000 buildings in a 520-block area of San Francisco.
    The earthquake, centered near San Francisco, caused damage over a 640-km north-south
    area. It was felt as far north as Coos Bay and as far south as Los Angeles. The
    total felt area (971,000 km2) included most of California and parts of Nevada and
    Oregon. This earthquake apparently triggered far-field seismic activity throughout
    the United States until the 21st of April. Subsequent earthquakes were felt in the
    Imperial Valley of California, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, northern New Mexico, Ohio,
    and South Carolina.The earthquake was associated with the largest known displacement
    along a fault plane in the United States. Strike slip faulting on the San Andreas
    fault was observed for 317 km (190 miles) from Point Arena southward. Faulting in
    Humbol County on the Shelter Cove fault area was also observed. It is likely this
    fault was activated at the same time and ruptured separately from the San Andreas
    fault.) The greatest amount of horizontal slip (6.5 m) occurred near Port Reyer.
    The area to the southwest of the rift moved northwest relative to the area on the
    northeast of the rift (right-lateral strike-slip faulting). Besides the general
    horizontal displacement, there was a vertical movement of as much as 1.2 m in Sonoma
    and Mendocino counties.The rift, which began at 5:12:21 A.M. local time, came on
    shore 320 km north of San Francisco. Forests were demolished, and fences, roads,
    stream courses, and conduits which crossed the rift were dislocated. In addition
    to the great rift fissures, there were branch fissures, and considerable cracking
    of alluvial surfaces. Avalanches and earth slumps occurred, and where the ground
    contained excess water, earth flows were observed. Springs and artesian wells either
    increased or decreased in flow. Jets of water spurted through holes or fissures,
    creating mud or sand craterlets.Buildings on or near the surface fault were destroyed.
    Trees were uprooted or snapped off. Pipelines, broken along the many fissures, caused
    the water shortage that allowed raging fires to destroy the city.Generally, there
    was a decrease in intensity from the southwest toward the northeast, as the distance
    from the zone of faulting increased. However, the character of the ground also determined
    the amount of damage. The areas that incurred the most damage were those upon filled
    ground. In these areas, brick and frame houses were severely damaged or destroyed.Next
    in intensity to areas of filled land were those upon incoherent sands. There was
    a large amount of damage done in the cemeteries, which were built on sand. Movement
    in more than one direction was suggested by monuments twisted upon their bases.
    The damage in sandy areas was due to the shaking, settling, and sliding. The building
    destruction and the disturbance of railway roadbeds and rails was much more severe
    throughout the area covered by the inconsistent beds than on the older hard rock
    in the adjoining areas. Areas that had the least damage were on hard rock beds,
    chiefly of the Mesozoic Franciscan Formation. Although buildings throughout the
    City and County of San Francisco were damaged, most earthquake damage in this area
    was only moderate. Toppled chimneys and cracked plaster on walls and ceilings were
    common. The business district at Santa Rosa (30 km from the fault) was nearly totally
    demolished. Healdsburg, San Jose, and Agnews also had a large amount of damage.
    All these places were located on the valley floor on loose or only slightly coherent
    geological formations. The portions of Berkeley and Oakland, which were located
    on the alluvial slope, incurred more damage than the foothills, where the buildings
    were built on rock. In the Los Banos region of the western San Joaquin Valley (48
    km from the rift) the shaking intensity was also unusually great. Petaluma and San
    Rafael, though nearer the rift than Santa Rosa, received less damage. These towns
    were for the most part on, or close to, rocky ground. In San Francisco, the fire
    continued unchecked for three days leaving 12.2 km2 burned. Finally, the fire was
    stopped by dynamiting structures in its path. The burned area included 520 city
    blocks; 418 km of streetcar and cable were destroyed. Thousands of businesses were
    destroyed, and hundreds of thousands of people were homeless. There were 350,000
    who badly needed food. However, the disaster was unable to subdue the spirit of
    the people of the city. According to William Randolph Hearst, "The calamity seems
    overwhelming, and yet the people are not overwhelmed." The San Franciscans rebuilt
    their homes and businesses, and within two years, a new San Francisco arose from
    the ashes.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key": "bbox-east-long",ntt"value":
