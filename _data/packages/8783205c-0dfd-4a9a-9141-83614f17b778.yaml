    Dataset for the Year 2000) data set provides a high-resolution (30 m) map of year-2000
    baseline estimates of basal area-weighted canopy height, aboveground live dry biomass,
    and standing carbon stock for the conterminous United States. This data set distributes,
    for each of 66 map zones, a set of six raster files in GeoTIFF format. There is
    a detailed README companion file for each map zone. There is also an ArcGIS shapefile
    (mapping_zone_shapefile.shp) with the boundaries of all the map zones. A mosaic
    image of biomass at 240 m resolution for the whole conterminous U.S. is also included.Please
    read this important note regarding the differences of Version 2 from Version 1 of
    the NBCD 2000 data. With Version 1, in some mapping zones, certain land cover types
    (in particular Shrubs, NLCD Type 52) were missing from and unaccounted for in modeled
    estimates because of a lack of reference data. In Version 1, when landcover types
    were missing in the models, the model for the deciduous tree cover type was applied.
    While more woody vegetation was mapped, the authors think this had little effect
    on model performance as in most cases NLCD version 1 cover type was not a strong
    predictor of modeled estimates (See companion Mapping Zone Readme files). In Version
    2, after renewed modeling efforts and user feedback, these previously unaccounted
    for cover types are now included in modeled estimates.All 66 mapping zones were
    updated with the previously unmapped land cover types now mapped. The authors recommend
    use of the new version for all analyses and will only support the updated version.Development
    of the data set used an empirical modeling approach that combined USDA Forest Service
    Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data with high-resolution InSAR data acquired
    from the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and optical remote sensing
    data acquired from the Landsat ETM+ sensor. Three-season Landsat ETM+ data were
    systematically compiled by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium
    (MRLC) between 1999 and 2002 for the entire U.S. and were the foundation for development
    of both the USGS National Land Cover Dataset 2001 (NLCD 2001) and the Landscape
    Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools Project (LANDFIRE). Products from both
    the NLCD 2001 (landcover and canopy density) and LANDFIRE (existing vegetation type)
    projects as well as topographic information from the USGS National Elevation Dataset
    (NED) were used within the NBCD 2000 project as spatial predictor layers for canopy
    height and biomass estimation. Forest survey data provided by the USDA Forest Service
    FIA program were made available to the project under a national Memorandum of Understanding.
    The response variables (canopy height and biomass) used in model development and
    validation were derived from the FIA database (FIADB). Production of the NLCD 2001
    and LANDFIRE projects was based on a mapping zone approach in which the conterminous
    U.S. was split into 66 ecoregionally distinct mapping zones. This mapping zone approach
    was also adopted by the NBCD 2000 project. ",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
