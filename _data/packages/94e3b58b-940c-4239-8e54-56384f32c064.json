	"notes": "ABSTRACT: This data set contains two ASCII files (.txt format). One file provides ground-based biophysical measurements and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) estimates for 31 black spruce (Picea mariana) and 30 quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands in Superior National Forest (SNF) in northeastern Minnesota, U.S.A. (-92 W 48 N). The measurements were obtained during a 1983-1984 intensive field campaign. Non-destructive measurements were made in over 100 forest plots covering a 50 x 50 km area. Sacrificed trees for biomass and annual increment measurements were taken outside the plots. The second file provides climate data from nearby weather stations for the period 1976-1986.The data set provides stand structural measurements (diameter at breast height, tree height, crown depth, and stem density), above-ground biomass, leaf area index, bark area index, and ANPP estimates. ANPP data are based on a combination of allometric relationships and annual tree-ring (radial) increments for the 5-year period 1979-1983.In the spruce stands, above-ground biomass ranged from 700-15,100 g/m2, LAI varied between 0.5-4.3, and ANPP ranged from 39-572 g/m2/yr. In comparison, above-ground biomass among aspen stands ranged from 600-22,000 g/m2, LAI varied between 1.3-4.0, and ANPP ranged from 213-1,199 g/m2/yr.The purpose of the SNF campaign was to investigate the ability of remote sensing to provide estimates of ecosystem biophysical properties. In addition to the results presented herein, satellite, aircraft, and helicopter observations and other ground measurements for the study sites are available from the ORNL DAAC Superior National Forest (SNF) Project web site [http://daac.ornl.gov/SNF/snf.shtml].",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
