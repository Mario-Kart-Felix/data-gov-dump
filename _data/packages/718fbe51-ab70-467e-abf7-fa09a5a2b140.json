	"notes": "This part of DS 781 presents data for folds for the geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore of Tomales Point map area, California. The vector data file is included in \"Folds_OffshoreTomalesPoint.zip,\" which is accessible from http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/ds\/781\/OffshoreTomalesPoint\/data_catalog_OffshoreTomalesPoint.html. The Point Reyes Peninsula is bounded to the south and west in the offshore by the north- and east-dipping Point Reyes Thrust Fault (McCulloch, 1987; Heck and others, 1990), which lies about 20 km west of Tomales Point. Granitic basement rocks are offset about 1.4 km on this thrust fault offshore of Point Reyes (McCulloch, 1987), and this uplift combined with west-side-up offset on the San Andreas Fault (Grove and Niemi, 2005) resulted in uplift of the Point Reyes Peninsula, including Tomales Point and the adjacent continental shelf. Grove and others (2010) reported uplift rates of as much as 1 mm\/yr for the south flank of the Point Reyes Peninsula based on marine terraces, but reported no datable terrace surfaces that could constrain uplift for the flight of 4-5 terraces exposed farther north along Tomales Point. Folds were primarily mapped by interpretation of seismic reflection profile data (see field activity S-15-10-NC). The seismic reflection profiles were collected between 2007 and 2010.
