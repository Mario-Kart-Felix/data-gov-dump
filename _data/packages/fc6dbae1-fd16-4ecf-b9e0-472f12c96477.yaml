    delineations in one seamless dataset of drainage area delineations called Minnesota
    Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Catchments. The DNR Catchment dataset extends
    into adjacent states where water flows into Minnesota and or where DNR Catchment
    delineations extend across the state boundary. Minnesota DNR Catchments are the
    smallest delineated and digitized drainage area mapped by the Minnesota DNR Watershed
    Delineation Project. The overall goal of this mapping effort is to produce the best
    drainage area delineations available that reflect the current hydrology of the landscape
    as interpreted from as many data sources necessary to derive acceptable watershed
    delineations. Minnesota DNR Catchments are delineated from the perspective of hydrologists
    who refrained from allowing cartography to drive the delineation linework. This
    was accomplished by excluding political boundaries and cartographic esthetics during
    the delineation procedure, focusing instead, on landscape hydrology. Minnesota DNR
    Catchments contain all of the land area(s), including noncontributing inclusions,
    and all water features upstream from, or between DNR Pour Points. Therefore, Minnesota
    DNR Catchments are not scale dependent. There is no size limit as to how large or
    small the delineation may be, an individual DNR Catchment in the dataset may represent
    the drainage area of a 1-acre prairie wetland or a 100-acre recreational lake. For
    a more detailed background on this data, follow this link to the DNR Watershed Project:
