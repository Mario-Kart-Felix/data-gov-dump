	"notes": "NextGen Aeronautics, Inc. proposes the development of the innovative use of morphing structures for maneuver and flight control as a project for NASA?s Revolutionary Flight Concepts (Topic A7.02).  Although aircraft morphing for mission performance enhancement is currently receiving much attention from the research community, there is not a great emphasis on utilizing the same technology for flight control.  NextGen, with its extensive experience in smart structures, smart actuation and aircraft morphing has a unique combination of skills and background to develop the proposed concept.  NextGen has proposed a morphing fan wing concept as the platform for this project, based upon well-understood flight characteristics and apparent ease of integration.  Asymmetric deployment of the fan wing will be utilized to effect roll control of the aircraft.  NextGen intends to verify the feasibility of this concept in Phase I, with an eventual flight test planned for Phase II.  NextGen will address the critical issues involved with this concept (structures, actuation, skin technology, etc.) in bringing the technology to maturation.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
