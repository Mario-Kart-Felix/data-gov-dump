  representing the approximate location of tax parcels contained in County Assessor
  tax rolls. Individual county data was integrated into this statewide publication
  by the Arkansas Geographic Information Office (AGIO). The Computer Aided Mass Appraisal
  (CAMA) systems maintained in each county are used to populate the database attributes
  for each polygon feature. The entity attribute structure conforms to the Arkansas
  Cadastral Mapping Standard. The digital cadastral data is provided as a publication
  version that only represents a snapshot of the production data at the time it was
  received from the county. Published updates may be made to counties throughout the
  year. These will occur after new data is digitized or updates to existing data are
  finished. Production versions of the data exist in the various counties where daily
  and weekly updates occur. Users should consult the BEGIN_DATE attribute column to
  determine the age of the data for a given county. This column reflects the date
  when AGIO received the data from the county. Only parcels with an associated Computer
  Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) record are provided. This means a CAMA record may
  exist, but no polygon geometry or vice-versa. Cadastral data is dynamic by its nature;
  therefore it is impossible for any county to ever be considered complete. The data
  is NOT topologically enforced. As a statewide integrator, AGIO publishes the data
  but does not make judgment calls about where points or polygon lines are meant to
  be located. Therefore each county data set is published without topology rules being
  enforced. Mappers use best practices such as polygon closure and vertex snapping,
  however, topology is not built for each county. Users should be aware, by Arkansas
  Law (15-21-504 2 B) digital cadastral data does not represent legal property boundary
  descriptions, nor is it suitable for boundary determination of the individual parcels
  included in the cadastre. Users requiring a boundary determination should consult
  an Arkansas Registered Land Surveyor on boundary questions. The digital cadastral
  data is intended to be a graphical representation of the tax parcel only. Just because
  a county is listed does NOT imply the data represents county wide coverage. AGIO
  worked with each county to determine a level of production that warranted the data
  was ready to be published. For example, in some counties only the north part of
  the county was covered or in other cases only rural parcels are covered and yet
  in others only urban parcels. The approach is to begin incremental publishing as
  production blocks are ready, even though a county may not have county wide coverage.
  Each case represents a significant amount of data that will be useful immediately.
  Users should consult the BEGIN_DATE attribute column. This date reflects when the
  data was received from the county. Digital cadastral data users should be aware
  the County Assessor Mapping Program adopted a phased approach for developing cadastral
  data. Phase One includes the production of a parcel centroid for each parcel that
  bears the attributes prescribed by the state cadastral mapping standard. Phase Two
  includes the production of parcel polygon geometry and bears the standard attributes.
  The Arkansas standard closely mirrors the federal Cadastral Core Data Standard established
  by the Federal Geographic Data Committee, Subcommittee for Cadastral Data. Counties
  within this file include: Arkansas, Ashley, Baxter, Boone, Chicot, Carroll, Clark,
  Clay, Columbia, Conway, Craighead, Crawford, Cross, Faulkner, Franklin, Howard,
