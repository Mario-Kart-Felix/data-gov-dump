	"notes": "Micro-electro-mechanical System (MEMS)-based gyroscopes, accelerometersnand rate sensors are essential to miniaturizing the guidance, navigationnand control electronics of satellite systems.  Wafer level packaging isnthe preferred method of sealing MEMS devices to achieve low cost.nHowever, devices are currently housed in expensive hermetic packages.nIn the case of gyros, high vacuum levels need to be created andnmaintained to achieve high Q values.  Current hybrid hermetic packagesnare expensive, heavy and bulky.  Although there is considerable activitynin developing wafer level sealing techniques, there is currently nonuniversal approach to seal MEMS devices at the wafer level.  SiWavenproposes to develop a universal wafer level sealing technology that:ndoes not require processing of the device wafer, achieves roomntemperature sealing enabling encapsulation of sensitive devices andnprovides for an evaporable getter to maintain a high vacuum over thenlife of the package.  SiWave will package a very high accuracy, absolutenpressure sensor to demonstrate the concept as well as to quantify theneffectiveness of the proposed approach. Once sealed at the wafer level,nthe device can be singulated and packaged using conventional plasticnpackaging techniques or housed in a low cost, plastic enclosurendepending on the application.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
