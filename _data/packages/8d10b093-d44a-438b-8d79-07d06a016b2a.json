	"notes": "This data set provides monthly burned area, and monthly, and annual fire emissions data from July 1996 to February 2012. Emissions data are available for carbon (C), dry matter (DM), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), hydrogen (H2), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), organic carbon (OC), black carbon (BC), particulate matter 2.5 micron (PM2p5), total particulate matter (TPM), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). The C4 fraction of carbon emissions is also provided. The annual C emissions estimates were derived by combining burned area data with a biogeochemical model, CASA-Global Fire Emissions Database (CASA-GFED), that estimates fuel loads and combustion completeness for each monthly time step. The fuel loads were based on satellite derived information on vegetation characteristics and productivity to estimate carbon input and carbon outputs through heterotrophic respiration, herbivory, and fires. Note that while most emissions estimates included data for 32 variables (trace gases, aerosols, and carbon), not all data are available for all years, and not all variables (emission species) are included in each data product.Additional information may be obtained from the Global Fire Data website: http:\/\/www.globalfiredata.org\/index.html. Data products include:- 0.5 degree x 0.5 degree gridded monthly burned area data (ha) for 1996 to 2012 provided as text files and as GeoTIFF files for 1996 to 2012.- 3-Hourly emssions (fraction) for 2003 to 2010 in NetCDF (.nc) format.- Daily emssions (fraction) for 2003 to 2010, in NetCDF (.nc) format.- Monthly emissions for 32 variables from 1997 to 2011, in text and GeoTIFF format.- Monthly emissions for 31 variables from specific sources (grassland and savanna, woodland, deforestation & degradation, forest, agricultural waste burning, and peat fires), both as absolute and relative emissions. The time period is for 2007 to 2011, and the files are provided in text and GeoTIFF format.- Global emission totals of C and other species from all sources, and from each individual source (forest fires, peat fires, agricultural waste burning, etc).- Annual emissions of carbon and other trace gases for all countries, for the period 1997 to 2010, provided as text files. These files are for indicative use only; they are not suitable for official reporting due to large uncertainties and potential for missing key regional aspects in the global approach used.- Ancillary data for monthly biosphere fluxes. The CASA-GFED biosphere flux sources include Net Primary Production (NPP), Heterotrophic respiration (Rh), and fires (biomass burning). These files are for the time period 1997 to 2009 and are provided as text files and in GeoTIFF format.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
