	"notes": "Shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions (SWBLI) pose challenges to aeronautical engineers because they create regions of adverse pressure gradients as a result of the discontinuous change in conditions across the shock.  This shock-induced pressure gradient is a common factor for both flow separation in supersonic inlets and high stagnation pressure losses on transonic wings, factors which are known to reduce performance and efficiency.  These affects can be corrected with appropriate forms of flow control.  Innovative Technology Applications Company (ITAC) and University of Notre Dame (UND) propose the use of electrohydrodynamic (EHD) plasma actuators to control the affects of SWBLIs for two types of problems, one involving boundary layer separation and the other transonic wave drag.  We propose to use plasma actuators near the region of the SWBLI to eliminate or delay the onset of separation in supersonic inlets while using plasma-based shock control methods to reduce the stagnation pressure losses on transonic airfoils.  The advantages of the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) actuators are that they are fully electronic, contain no moving parts, surface mountable, minimally intrusive, can be turned off when not needed, and electrically re-configurable for optimal control in dynamic flow conditions.rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
