    in aerospace applications become more capable, the ability to utilize information
    supplied by them becomes increasingly important. While certain types of vehicle
    health data can be effectively processed and acted upon by crew or support personnel,
    others, due to their complexity or time constraints, require either automated or
    semi-automated reasoning. Prognostics-enabled Decision Making (PDM) is an emerging
    research area that aims to integrate prognostic health information and knowledge
    about the future operating conditions into the process of selecting subsequent actions
    for the system. The newly developed PDM algorithms require suitable software and
    hardware platforms for testing under realistic fault scenarios. The paper describes
    the development of such a platform, based on the K11 planetary rover prototype.
    A variety of injectable fault modes are being investigated for electrical, mechanical,
    and power subsystems of the testbed, along with methods for data collection and
    processing. In addition to the hardware platform, a software simulator with matching
    capabilities has been developed. The simulator allows for prototyping and initial
    validation of the algorithms prior to their deployment on the K11. The simulator
    is also available to the PDM algorithms to assist with the reasoning process. A
    reference set of diagnostic, prognostic, and decision making algorithms is also
    described, followed by an overview of the current test scenarios and the results
    of their execution on the simulator.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
