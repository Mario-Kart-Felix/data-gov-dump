    WAAS, ESV, ADS-B) improved flight safety but engendered more complexity and increased
    pilot/computer interaction and workload with aviation accident rate unchanged for
    the past decade. Cockpit interactions would be safer and more efficient thorugh
    Voice Communication. Though Voice Recognition systems are becoming widely used,
    in flight environment conditions usage has been limited due to the unique challenges
    of elevated noise levels, specific cockpit lexicon, limited cockpit hardware, and
    lack of standardization.  SouthernAir Aviation Inc. has developed a NextGen Voice
    Activated Cockpit Management system with applications for flight procedures, emergency
    procedures, control of aircraft systems and flight management systems.  From simple
    to complex architectures, the system syncronizes software applications and aircraft
    systems in a unified model of both language and safety critical development environment
    to voice activate functions using NextGen Voice Recognition with heuristic pilot
    response.  Procedures are enabled through wireless Bluetooth connection or wired
    communication. Additional tools of the system include a novel HMM Model comprising
    a decision management algorithm and synthetic lexicon for parsing and contiguous
    recognition.  All the performance requirements are met within a 2&#37; time-slice
    of a 700MHz Power PC processor and within 1 GB of memory.  Unique key capabilities
    include: Automatic Lexicon Development, Phonetic Distance Analysis, Coarticulation
    Handling, Accent Tolerability.  The NextGen advanced performance relies on allophone
    parsing and reduced recognition error with data processing in real-time, ideal for
    critical emergency situations. This system is remarkable in that it achieves very
    high recognition rates (98&#37;) with a very large command set (131,000 unique words
    and thousands of word combinations).rnrnWe gratefully acknowledge NASA SBIR Phase

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
