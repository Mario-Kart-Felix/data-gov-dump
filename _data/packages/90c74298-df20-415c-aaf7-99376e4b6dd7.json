	"notes": "The purity of hydrogen fuel is important in engine testing at SSC. The hydrogen may become contaminated with nitrogen, argon, helium or oxygen. The hydrogen from the fuel tank  s or feed lines is analyzed beforehand. Therefore, there is a need for a non-intrusive, on-line, near real-time monitor for H2. The analytical technique should measure various impurities (molecular and atomic) simultaneously and be easy to implement in the field. The objective of this proposed research is to develop an analytical technique based on Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) to measure simultaneously the concentrations of nitrogen (N2), argon (Ar), Helium (He) and oxygen (O2) contaminants in hydrogen (H2) gas storage tanks and supply lines. Advanced sensors for monitoring multiple species in H2 feed-lines and storage tanks will be useful before engine testing and will increase understanding of engine performance. Phase I has provided necessary information to build a sensitive, compact, sturdy, user-friendly and fieldable prototype in Phase II, with ease of implementation at NASA/SSC. In Phase II, a prototype LIBS system will be designed and fabricated to measure impurities in H2 fuel at different places in the H2 feed line. This integrated system will be delivered to NASA/SSC at the end of Phase II.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
