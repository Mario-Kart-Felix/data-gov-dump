	"notes": "NASA has been tasked to develop new and advanced capabilities to support both future manned and robotic missions to the lunar and Martian surfaces.  It is the purpose of this program to develop advanced avionics, software, and information technologies for exploration missions.  In particular, NASA is concerned with the extreme radiation present on the lunar surface, Martian surface, and in deep space.  Spacecraft electronics will need to be radiation hardened against a TID of 100 krads (Si) or more and provide SEL immunity of 100 MeV cm2/mg or greater.   Furthermore, electronics in these environments are also subjected to multiple thermal-cycling and wide temperature ranges.  rn  rnOur innovation provides solutions for the mitigation of radiation effects on reprogrammable SRAM-based FPGA processor elements through the use of an advanced foundry process combined with innovative and RHBD methods to mitigate total ionizing dose and provide SEL immunity, and SEU tolerance.  These techniques will be utilized to develop a prototype of radiation hardened, reprogrammable FPGA that will be fabricated and tested, suitable for consideration in future NASA Flagship programs. rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
