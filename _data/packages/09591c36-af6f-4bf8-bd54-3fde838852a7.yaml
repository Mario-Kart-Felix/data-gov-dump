  Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
  reef ecosystems, from 16 October - 14 November 2008, belt transect surveys of coral
  population and diseases quantitative assessments were conducted, as a part of Rapid
  Ecological Assessments (REA), during the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring
  Program (RAMP) Cruise OES0810 in the Main Hawaiian Islands at biennial intervals
  by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries
  Science Center (PIFSC). During the cruise, there were 5 surveys in total conducted
  at REA sites around Niihau Island in the Main Hawaiian Islands. At the specific
  REA sites, coral biologists along with fish biologists, algal biologists and marine
  invertebrate zoologist entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~300 m2) and
  high degree of taxonomic resolution REA survey to assess and monitor species composition,
  abundance, percent cover, size distribution, diversity, and general health of fish,
  corals, macro-invertebrates, and algae in shallow-water (< 35 m) habitats. As a
  part of REA surveys, the coral belt surveys were focused on quantifying the diversity,
  abundance, density, and size-class distribution of the anthozoan and hydrozoan corals
  as well as the condition and health state of the coral reef populations. The surveys
  were conducted along two consecutively-placed, 25m transect lines. The belt width
  was dictated at the beginning of each dive by subjective perceived colony density:
  1-m width was used in high density areas, while 2-m width was used in low density
  areas. Within each 25m transect, five 2.5-meter segments were surveyed (beginning
  at points: 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 meters), whereby in each segment, all coral colonies
  whose center fell within 0.5m of either side of the transect line were identified
  to the lowest taxonomic level possible (genus or species) and two planar size metrics
  were collected: maximum diameter and diameter perpendicular to the maximum diameter.
  In addition, the extent of mortality, both recent and old, was estimated for each
  colony. Observers paid special attention to identifying as best as possible the
  extent of the former live colony. When a coral colony exhibited signs of disease
  or compromised health, additional information was recorded including type of affliction
  (bleaching, skeletal growth anomaly, white syndrome, tissue loss other than white
  syndrome, trematodiasis, necrosis, other, pigmentation responses, algal overgrowth,
  and predation), severity of the affliction (mild, moderate, marked, severe, acute),
  as well as photographic documentation and sometimes tissue samples. Tissue samples
  were catalogued and fixed in buffered zinc-formalin solution for further histopathological
  analyses. Raw survey data included species presence and relative abundance, colony
  counts per taxon, size (width and length), mortality, predation, and health status.
  A surveyed area was ranging from 10m2 to 25m2 per site.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819\",\n\t\"extras\":
