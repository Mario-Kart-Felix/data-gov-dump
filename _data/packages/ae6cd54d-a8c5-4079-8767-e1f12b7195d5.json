There has been a lot of research targeting text classification. Many of them focusrnon a particular characteristic of text data - multi-labelity. This arises due to the fact that arndocument may be associated with multiple classes at the same time. The consequence of such arncharacteristic is the low performance of traditional binary or multi-class classification techniques onrnmulti-label text data. In this paper, we propose a text classification technique that considers thisrncharacteristic and provides very good performance. Our multi-label text classification approachrnis an extension of our previously formulated [3] multi-class text classification approach calledrnSISC (Semi-supervised Impurity based Subspace Clustering). We call this new classification modelrnas SISC-ML(SISC Multi-Label). Empirical evaluation on real world multi-label NASA ASRSrn(Aviation Safety Reporting System) data set reveals that our approach outperforms state-of-theartrntext classification as well as subspace clustering algorithms.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
