	"notes": " This presentation will review the use of knowledge management in the development and support of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) systems for complex systems with particular emphasis on the experience of the development of the Fault Model for large commercial  aircraft.  The presentation is divided into four sections:rnrn1.       Review of experience of building fault models and Central Maintenance Computer for large commercial aircraft.rn2.       Review of the key functions and usage scenarios for a typical CBM Knowledge Management Systemrn3.       Identification of criteria for evaluation of implementation alternativesrnrnThe presentation will conclude with a short discussion of future directions for CBM Knowledge Management Systems.rnrn**Speaker: Tim Felke, Honeywell**rnrn rnrnTim Felke joined Honeywell in 1984 as a control systems analyst and was the manager for their Systems Analysis and Engineering Sciences department for several years. He was a principle author of the proposal for the Central Maintenance Computer for the Boeing 777 and then was a leader in its development. Since then he has been an Engineering Fellow for the diagnostic and knowledge management functions of the Aircraft Diagnostic and Maintenance Systems group. In this work he has published several papers and is the principle inventor or significant contributor on nearly a dozen patents. He holds a BS in Electrical Engineering from Arizona State University.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
