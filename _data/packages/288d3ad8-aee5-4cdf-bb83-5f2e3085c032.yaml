  can enable 1-year round-trips to Mars, regardless of alignment, with the same launch
  mass to low Earth orbit (350 mT) estimated by the Mars Design Reference Architecture
  5.0 study for a 3-year conjunction mission. Key to achieving such a propulsion capability
  is the ability to convert, at high efficiency and with only minimal losses rejected
  as heat via radiators, the energy of charged particle reaction products originating
  from an advanced fission or aneutronic fusion source directly into electricity conditioned
  as required to power an electric thruster.&amp;nbsp; The TWDEC concept accomplishes
  this by converting particle beam energy into radio frequency (RF) alternating current
  electrical power, such as can be used to heat the propellant in a plasma thruster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This
  project is core to the development of multi-MW power for electric propulsion.&amp;nbsp;
  The technology developed will enable high power systems which have specific mass
  in the low single-digits and which are sun-independent, require no neutron shielding,
  and produce no radioactive waste.&amp;nbsp; The power levels and specific mass this
  technology could provide will, when combined with either high-efficiency Q-thrusters
  or VASIMR-class plasma thrusters, enable rapid human missions to Mars and beyond.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
  Project Infusion Path: Low specific mass (a &amp;ndash; kg/kWe) in-space electric

  plasma thruster. In a more advanced concept (explored in a 2012 Phase 1 NASA Innovative
  Advanced Concepts (NIAC) project), the TWDEC could also be utilized to condition
  the particle beam such that it may transfer directed kinetic energy to a target
  propellant plasma for the purpose of increasing thrust and optimizing the specific
  impulse.&amp;nbsp; While other government agencies and/or industry partners are
  pursuing aneutronic fusion reactors and plasma propulsion, NASA JSC is the only
  entity advancing this core energy conversion technology. With successful development
  of this system by NASA and its partners, an intermediate NASA infusion step would
  demonstrate megawatt-class aneutronic fusion, TWDEC, and electric propulsion (e.g.,
  Q-thruster, VASIMR) systems on robotic missions to the Jovian moons.&amp;nbsp; Human

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
