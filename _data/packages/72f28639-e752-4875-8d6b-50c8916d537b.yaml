    and three climate data files (ASCII .txt format). There is one NPP file for each
    of the five sub-types of upper montane tropical forest located along John Crow Ridge
    in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica. Biomass, productivity, tree mortality, standing
    crop of litter, LAI, and nutrient content of leaf fall were measured from 1974 to
    1978. Long-term climate data are available from Cinchona Botanic Gardens, approximately
    3 km south of the John Crow Ridge study area and at similar elevation.The John Crow
    Ridge study areas (18.08 N 76.65 W) consist of 8 to 10 contiguous 10 m x 10 m permanent
    plots. The forests are of low stature and appear to be completely undisturbed. The
    forest floor at one sub-site (Mor Ridge) was overlain by a 30-50 cm layer of mor
    humus with a high C/N ratio.ANPP was estimated to be between 654-997 g/m2/year (sum
    of litterfall and trunk/branch increment), or 854-1,057 g/m2/year (including tree
    mortality). These figures are lower than for lowland tropical forests with greater
    leaf turnover and reflect the relatively low stature of the upper montane forest
    plots. Above-ground biomass was estimated by both destructive methods and nondestructive
    regression analysis. Values ranged from 23,000 to 34,000 g/m2. Below-ground biomass
    (5,370 g/m2) was determined for one site by harvesting roots to a depth of 50 cm.
    LAI for trees plus understory, where measured, was 5.5-5.7 m2/m2.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
