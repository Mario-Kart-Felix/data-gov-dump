    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Considering the information provided in
    the previous section, the objective of the present investigation is to examine foraging
    habits of wood storks, as well as contaminants in dead nestlings from an urban colony
    and in prey and sediments from waterbodies used by foraging wood storks. Given the
    mobility of wading birds, the loss of natural wetlands, the gain of man-made water
    bodies, and the negligible contaminant risks, enhancement of man-made water bodies
    may assist efforts to conserve species such as wood storks. Enhancements could include
    stocking of prey fish, decreasing slopes and/or installing littoral, and controlling
    emergent aquatic vegetation to increase their ability to forage. Federal agencies
    under section 7(a)(1) of the ESA are authorized to carry out programs to further
    the conservation of threatened and endangered species. Under the FWCA and MBTA,
    the USFWS can submit comments to project proponents for furthering conservation
    and minimizing impacts associated with proposed activities. To illustrate, Federal
    agencies that have permitting programs associated with retention ponds could offer
    incentives or establish requirements for ponds to be constructed in a way that would
    enhance their use by wading birds such as wood storks. Although Martin (2010) suggested
    steep slopes should be maintained on golf course ponds because those types of man-made
    water bodies had higher concentrations of certain contaminants compared to the other
    water bodies, Martin (2010) also stated that exposure to contaminants across all
    water bodies, including golf, course ponds was low and there was little risk of
    adverse effects to wood storks that foraged on prey from the water bodies. The USFWS
    has authorities under section 7(a)(2) and 10 of the ESA to require project proponents
    to develop and implement reasonable and prudent measures to minimize take of federally
    threatened or endangered species, but the USFWS has to be reasonably certain that
    the area is occupied (or used) by the species, and that the projectu2019s direct
    and indirect effects are going to take individuals of that species, This investigation
    supports the first of these two requirements, but not the second. In regard to the
    contaminant-related effects on wood storks, the present investigation indicates
    that contaminant exposure is not reasonably certain to result in take of wood storks
    that forage in the types of man-made water bodies that are represented in the present
    investigation; and therefore, the USFWS could not require changes to the design
    of new water bodies or modification of existing water bodies. During section 7(a)(2)
    consultations, the USFWS can, however, make conservation recommendations (which
    are not mandatory) to project proponents that would aid in the conservation of threatened
    and endangered species by enhancing or discouraging the use of manmade water bodies
    by wading birds. Depending on the situation, these recommendations could include
    the stocking of fish, creation of littoral zones, and other activities that would
    increase the use of the retention ponds by wading birds; or conversely, include
    measures to discourage bird use. In a broader sense, it should be noted that contaminant
    and noncontaminant-related risks are considered during ESA consultations and may
    drive decisions regarding whether or not to enhance man-made water bodies for wading
    birds. For example, the proximity of retention ponds to roads and highways is a
    concern because of potential automobile strikes. In closing, development of a document
    to guide decisions regarding the design and management of retention ponds and other
    man-made water bodies may be useful in streamlining regulatory procedures and aiding
    the conservation of wood storks and other wading birds.",nt"license_title":
