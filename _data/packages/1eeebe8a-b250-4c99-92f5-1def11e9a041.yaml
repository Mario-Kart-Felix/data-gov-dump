    of constant hydraulic conductivity values for the Tillman terrace and alluvial aquifer
    in southwestern Oklahoma. The Tillman terrace and alluvial aquifer encompasses the
    unconsolidated terrace deposits and alluvium associated with the North Fork of the
    Red River and the Red River in the western half of Tillman County. These sediments
    consist of discontinuous layers of clay, sandy clay, sand, and gravel. The aquifer
    extends over an area of 285 square miles and is used for irrigation and domestic
    purposes. Granite and the Hennessey Formation outcrop in northern parts of the aquifer
    where alluvial deposits are absent. These outcrops were included as part of the
    aquifer in a thesis in which the ground-water flow in the aquifer was modeled. An
    average hydraulic conductivity value of 92.5 feet per day was used for both the
    terrace and alluvial deposits in this data set and was reported in the thesis. The
    hydraulic conductivity polygons were derived from two sources. The outer polygon
    representing the outer shell of a model grid for a ground-water flow model of the
    Tillman terrace and alluvial aquifer was digitized from a paper map in a thesis
    at a scale of 1:249,695. Polygons and lines representing geologic contacts were
    extracted from a published digital surficial geology data set based on a scale of
    1:250,000. Small polygons along the eastern boundary of the aquifer were created
    when the outer polygon of the model grid and the geology polygons and lines were
    combined. These small polygons represent geologic units other than the Tillman terrace
    and alluvial aquifer within the model grid. Three small polygons representing outcrops
    of granite and the Hennessey Formation in the northern parts of the aquifer also
    were extracted from the digital surficial geology data set. Ground-water flow models
    are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models
    are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar
    results. Therefore, values of hydraulic conductivity used in the model and presented
    in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared
    to independently collected data.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    polygon representing the Tillman terrace and alluvial aquifer as reported by Al-Sumait
    (1978, p. 17, fig. 4) was digitized from a map published at a scale of 1:249,695.
    Hydraulic conductivity polygons representing granite and Hennessey Formation were
    constructed from digital data sets by Cederstrand (1996) that were scan digitized
    from mylar maps at a scale of 1:250,000. The hydraulic conductivity polygons represented
    at this scale are indicative of broad, regional trends and should not be interpreted
    as site-specific. The hydraulic conductivity polygon was digitized from a paper
    mape (8 inches by 11 inches) with a maximum registration root-mean-squared-error
    (RMSE) of 0.005 map inches 0.013 map centimeters and 364 feet (111 meters) ground
    distance. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and
    aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer
    characteristics may produce similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge
    are closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are in balance the model
    has a small mean residual; it represents the natural system numerically. If the
    hydraulic conductivity is accurately known, the model can be used to accurately
    determine recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly known, then
    the recharge will be poorly determined. Therefore, values of hydraulic conductivity
    used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within
    a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data. In most aquifers,
    hydraulic conductivity measurements made in wells or in cores will range over several
    orders of magnitude, even over short horizontal and vertical distances. Hydraulic
    conductivity values derived from ground-water flow models represent areal generalizations
    and do not reflect the large local variance in well or core measurements.", "Access
