  Layer Experiments) data consists of  estimates of the rate of exchange of a wide
  variety of aerosols and gases between the Amazon Basin and its atmospheric boundary
  layer, and the processes by which these aerosols and gases are moved between the
  boundary layer and the free troposphere. The data are presented in gzipped ASCII
  text files in Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE) format.The ABLE-2 project consisted
  of two expeditions: the first in the Amazonian dry season (ABLE-2A, July-August
  1985); and the second in the wet season (ABLE-2B, April-May 1987). The ABLE-2 core
  research data were gathered by NASA Electra aircraft flights that stretched from
  Belem, at the mouth of the Amazon River, west to Tabatinga, on the Brazil-Colombia
  border, from a base at Manaus in the heart of the forest. See Figure 1. These observations
  were supplemented by ground based chemical and meteorological measurements in the
  dry forest, the Amazon floodplain, and the tributary rivers through use of enclosures,
  an instrumented tower in the jungle, a large tethered balloon, and weather and ozone
  sondes.This study showed air above the Amazon jungle to be extremely clean during
  the wet season but air quality deteriorated dramatically during the dry season as
  the result of biomass burning, performed mostly at the edges of the forest. Biomass
  burning is also a source of greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane, as well
  as other pollutants (carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen). Amazonian ozone deposition
  rates were found to be 5 to 50 times higher than those previously measured over
  pine forests and water surfaces. The Amazon River floodplain is a globally significant
  source of methane, supplying about 12% of the estimated worldwide total from all
  wetlands sources. Over Amazonia, carbon monoxide is enhanced by factors ranging
  from 1.2 to 2.7 by comparison with adjacent regions due to isoprene oxidation and
  biomass burning. Over the rainforest individual convective storms transport 200
  megatons of air per hour, of which 3 megatons is water vapor that releases 100,000
  megawatts of energy into the atmosphere through condensation into rain.The ABLE
  was a collaboration of U.S. and Brazilian scientists sponsored by NASA and Instituto
  Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) and supported by the Global Tropospheric
  Experiment (GTE) component of the NASA Tropospheric Chemistry Program.\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
