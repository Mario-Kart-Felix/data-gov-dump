    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience

    is a small business, which has developed a number of 3D flash LADAR systems.  Flash
    Ladar sensors are 3D video systems that return range and intensity information for
    each pixel in real time, and is functionally equivalent to 16000 range finders on
    one chip.  Actual data collected, at the JPL mars yard, using ASC's compact Flash
    Ladar system demonstrated in a previous NASA phase I SBIR effort confirm that the
    ASC Flash LADAR Video Camera (FLVC) system can meet the requirements for Entry,
    Descent and Landing (EDL).   The FLVC's small size, low power and very fast range
    data frame rate (30Hz) make the sensor ideal for EDL missions. rntFlash Ladar is
    ideal for determining real-time spacecraft trajectory, speed, orientation, and range
    to the planet surface, as well as evaluating potential hazards at the landing site.
     Sloped ground, craters, rocks and surface composition are among the potential
    hazards.  The "framing camera" nature, of Flash LADAR systems, makes them well
    suited as hazard avoidance sensors for EDL.  rntAn existing Phase two effort is
    fabricating a compact FLVC for delivery to NASA for field testing, however the system
    is not hardened.  A proposed Phase 2 effort would produce a space qualified sensor
    engine which can be integrated with the system being delivered to NASA.  The sensor
    engine is the break-though enabling technology for the FLVC.  This proposed effort
    will develop techniques to improve the sensors measurement accuracy.  ASC will develop
    improved calibration techniques, improved sensor non-uniformity and improved on-board
    real time automatic range correction.  This will target range resolutions of better
    than 1cm and range absolute accuracy better than 3cm.  The Phase 2 effort would
    deliver to NASA a commercial based system with the enhancements developed during
    Phase 1rn",nt"owner_org": "d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed",nt"extras":
