	"notes": "Abstract: Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) was part of an imaging radar system that was flown on board two Space Shuttle flights (9 - 20 April, 1994 and 30 September - 11 October, 1994). The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center distributes the C-band (5.8 cm) and L-band (23.5 cm) Survey Data. A total of about 50 hours of data, corresponding to roughly 50 million square kilometers of ground coverage, were collected during each mission. The ground swath width varies from 15 to 90 kilometers depending on the imaging mode and incidence angles of the radar beams. All science data were processed into Survey products. The Survey product is intended as a "quick look" browsing tool for viewing the areas imaged by SIR-C. This product is not designed to be used for quantitative scientific analysis. Survey Data consists of a frame image of a data segment, which represents a subset of the data swath. Resolution is approximately 100 meters, processed to a 50-meter pixel spacing. Additional information on SIR-C is available at: http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov.",
