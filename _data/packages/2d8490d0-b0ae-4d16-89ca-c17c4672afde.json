	"notes": "&lt;p&gt;Utilizing resin infusion to rigidize an inflatable structure and form fiber-reinforced composites on-orbit is a novel concept that builds on current NASA technology in expandable structures.&amp;nbsp; The current effort to design and build a prototype has sucessfully demonstrated a proof of concept that the technology is viable using current state-of-the art materials and manufacturing techniques.&amp;nbsp; A cylinder shaped object with round end caps was manufactured as a simple article, but domed shapes are possible and expected to be the most efficient although more complex to design and build.&amp;nbsp; A braided carbon fiber fabric material of two ply thickness was utilized in the prototype to provide a thin and optimally reinforced structure.&amp;nbsp; The fabric was contained on two sides with laminated sheet polymer to form a vacuum bag attached at both end caps. Vacuum ports and resin fill ports were located at opposite ends and routed to the fabric cavity between the two polymer sheets.&amp;nbsp; The cavity was evacuated and filled with resin that cured to form a rigid composite structure cylinder.&amp;nbsp; It is planned to perform a pressure test of the cylinder and produce a preliminary design of a larger dome-ended structure for proposed future work. A conceptual design for the mechanical system required to provide the internal pressure, vacuum resin trap, and resin mixing and filling will also be presented.&lt;\/p&gt;",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
