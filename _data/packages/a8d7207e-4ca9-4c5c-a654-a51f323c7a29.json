	"notes": "TRS Technologies, Virginia Tech., and MTech, Inc. propose to develop high torque (&gt;1.5 kg-cm), lightweight (&lt; 250 g), low power (&lt; 2 watts), high precision (&lt;0.2&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;), cryogenic stepping motors using single crystal piezoelectric technology.  The ultrasonic motors developed on this program will be targeted for use in passive optics positioning systems and interferometers in IR remote sensing and space telescope applications.  The above metrics were achieved during the Phase I program using a traveling wave ultrasonic motor with single crystal drive elements.  Motor operation was also demonstrated at 77K.  In Phase II, motor torque and speed will be increased and size, weight, and power will be further decreased by optimizing the motor design and crystal element configuration.  Drive electronics optimized for operation from 300 to 77K will also be developed.  Finally, the motor and electronics will be extensively tested at cryogenic conditions and under thermal cycling for reliability and repeatability.  At the conclusion of the Phase II program TRS and our partners will have optimized and characterized piezoelectric ultrasonic motors capable of operating over a very broad temperature range (400 to &lt; 77K) with significant performance improvements (torque, speed, precision, and power) over competing technologies with narrower temperature ranges.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
