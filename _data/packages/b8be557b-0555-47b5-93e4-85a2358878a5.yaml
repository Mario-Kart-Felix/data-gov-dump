  program (MSCP) was developed for the conservation of plants and animals in the southeast
  portion of San Diego County. Monitoring of species found within the MSCP is a key
  method to measuring the success of the reserve system. The Coastal Cactus Wren is
  one of the focal species identified as part of the MSCP Biological Monitoring Plan.
  The species is also currently on the State of California Birds of Species Concern
  list. The primary threat to the cactus wren is habitat loss and concurrent fragmentation,
  which occurs as habitat is developed or fire destroys cactus. The coastal cactus
  wren historically occurred in cactus patches along the several lagoons and coastal
  canyons in San Diego and southern Orange County (Rea and Weaver 1990), though recent
  surveys reveal that most of these populations have been destroyed by urbanization
  (Rea and Weaver 1990, USFWS 1994). The remaining coastal cactus wren populations
  in San Diego County are predominantly in the inland portion of the county (Rea and
  Weaver 1990, MSCP 1995). This datalayer presents the positive observations of USFWS
  Cactus Wren occupancy surveys conducted in San Diego County in 2009 and was compiled
  as part of the Southern California Data Integration Project. Extensive cactus mapping
  was conducted in San Diego County prior to the survey effort. Cactus wren monitoring
  was done within an occupancy framework to determine the percentage of plots occupied
  by cactus wrens, estimated from plot surveys. Surveys were conducted from July 10-August
  12, 2009 between sunrise and sunset. Each plot was visited up to 3 times during
  the survey season. Environmental measurements (air temperature, average wind speed)
  were recorded during a 1-minute period upon arriving at a sample point using a pocket
  weather station. Surveys were not conducted if average wind speeds exceeded 20 kilometers
  per hour, precipitation exceeded a drizzle, or ambient temperatures were less than
  4.5C (40F) or over 30C (85F). Surveyors used tape playback of cactus wren song to
  elicit response of cactus wrens on the plot to aid detectability. Following Mitrovich
  and Hamilton (2007), the tape was played for three 40 second intervals with one
  minute of silence in between. The surveyor listened and watched for cactus wrens
  as the tape was played and for one minute after each tape playback. Presence or
  absence of cactus wrens on the plot was recorded on a datasheet, as well as the
  number of juveniles, adults, or birds in which the life stage could not be determined.
  Additional information about the survey or bird was noted in the Comments field,
  such as whether a nest was observed. Habitat data collected for each plot included
  presence of Mexican elderberry (Sambucus mexicana) and Lemonadeberry (Rhus integrifolia),
  Percent of Prickly Pear and Cholla present, and the maximum height of Prickly Pear
  and Cholla. These data were typically collected on the first visit to each plot
  but may have been collected on the second visit instead due to logistical reasons.
