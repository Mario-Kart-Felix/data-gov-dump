	"notes": "Aurora Flight Sciences and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) propose to develop a stand-alone 6-DOF load sensing system that collects biomechanical force and moment data while integrated with the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) on the International Space Station by adapting and enhancing previously field-tested systems.  Our EDLS-ISS system includes a separate base unit tethered to two low-profile sensors, which can be non-invasively mounted on the surface of the ARED to serve as new footplates.rnrnThe EDLS-ISS is being developed for two reasons:rn- Operational.  Force plates on the ARED will allow crewmembers to verify loading, and to record forces.  This device provides a simple, non-invasive solution that measures foot forces and displays this to the astronaut.rn- Research.  Kinematic experiments on the ARED &amp;#150; for example, characterizing limb segment relative motions during a squat &amp;#150; require corresponding force and moment measurements.  Our EDLS-ISS system provides three-axis force and three-axis moment measurements for such experiments.rnBy providing a short-term operational solution and a sustainable long-term research solution, ELDS-ISS is an important tool for the spaceflight community.rnrnDuring Phase I, we improved the design of the existing 6-DOF Microgravity Investigation of Crew Reactions in 0-G (MICR0-G) Adapt sensor module, previously developed by Aurora and MIT.  These improvements optimized the sensor for use on the ARED: decreasing the overall height of the sensors and separating the electronics into an off-board "base unit", increasing the footprint size to cover most of the surface of the ARED platform, updating the hard drive and electronics, providing a real-time user-feedback display, and developing ARED mounting options.  The anticipated result of our Phase II effort will be three complete EDLS-ISS systems, each of which includes a base unit and two sensor units.  Two systems will be flight-qualified.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
