	"notes": "Hyperspectral imaging arrays offer far more data and the ability to discriminate objects being observed.  Continued difficulties with applying HgCdTe materials, especially for LWIR, present an opportunity for the development of alternate materials. One such candidate for MWIR/LWIR photodetectors are short period Type-II superlattices based on InAs/GaInSb.  This material system has the ability to tune the cutoff wavelengths during device fabrication and yet be amenable to the creation of multi-spectral serially-positioned pixels.  One of the issues this Phase I program will address is the intermixing of Arsenic and Antimony at the superlattice interfaces, which can hamper LWIR operation.  Improved superlattice growth will be achieved through the application of newly developed MBE apparatus.   At a second level, device performance will be enhanced by novel passivation of the pixel sidewalls.  The Type-II superlattices with then be applied to the creation of dual-wavelength photodetectors for MWIR/LWIR imaging.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
