  database of approximately 700,000 miles of streams and open waters in the conterminous
  United States. It is used extensively by EPA and States,and has been used by the
  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Weather Service for many years.
  This configuration of RF1 for the geographic information systems community, extends
  the use of RF1 to ARC/INFO users in the U.S.Geological Survey, the U.S. Environmental
  Protection Agency and others. RF1 was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection
  Agency (EPA) in 1982 from stable base color separates of National Oceanographic
  and Aeronautical Administration (NOAA) aeronautical charts having a scale of 1:500,000.
  These charts provided the best nationwide hydrographic coverage available on a single
  scale at that time. They included all hydrography shown on USGS maps having a scale
  of 1:250,000 with extensive additions, corrections and improvements in detail made
  by NOAA from aerial photography and satellite imagery. All hydrographic features
  on those charts were optically scanned from the color separates using a scanner
  resolution finer than feature line width. The surface water features selected for
  inclusion in the RF1 database were converted from the scanned raster form to vector
  form with coordinates expressed as latitude and longitude. Surface water names in
  RF1 were derived from the source maps and supplemented by names from miscellaneous
  state maps and maps of the USGS. Many other RF1 attributes are described herein.
  In the 1980's, RF1 was used by EPA for performing water quality modeling on whole
  river basins for all of the hydrologic regions in the conterminous United States.
  In this role, it was used to provide national assessments and overviews of water
  quality and to provide the foundation for a nationwide stratified sampling frame
  for performing statistical summaries of modeled and measured water quality on all
  the surface waters of the 48 States. In the 1980's, environmental data integration
  was strengthened significantly by EPA using the Reach File. Whereas, STORET had,
  for many years, integrated the water quality monitoring data of EPA, States, the
  USGS, and other Federal agencies by agency codes, standard water quality parameter
  codes, date, time, depth, site coordinates, state, basin, and user-definable polygons,
  the Reach File provided STORET with the capability to search upstream and downstream
  to relate the environmental data of many agencies to each other along stream paths.
  This brought about the ability to integrate ambient water quality at sites sampled
  by the several hundred official monitoring agencies using STORET in a new and powerful
  manner. Thus, for example, any and all water quality measurements made by the USGS
  and stored in WATSTORE were easily accessed via STORET prior to the introduction
  of the Reach File, but with the Reach File, it became possible to integrate the
  data from USGS WATSTORE records with the much larger holdings of environmental data
  from EPA, States and other Federal agencies on a station-by-station basis along
  stream paths. Stream ordered data integration of this type was important in the
  development of effluent guidelines pursuant to the Clean Water Act during the 1980's,
  and is but one example of the new dimension in data integration made possible by
  the standard reach numbering scheme and the hydrologic networking provided in RF1.
  Linking multiple databases to RF1 and hence to each other, was accomplished by a
  process called reach indexing. The process takes advantage of the facts that each
  reach has been assigned a unique identifier and the stream path for each reach is
  described in terms of latitude/longitude coordinates. Using simple algebraic processing,
  each lat/lon point for every point of interest in a database is indexed to the closest
  point in the nearest RF1 reach. The unique reach number for that reach and its relative
  position, prorated against the full computed reach length, is placed in the database
  being reach indexed. From then on, access to all points that have been reach indexed
  in that indexed database, may be achieved in hydrological order by navigating upstream
  or downstream through RF1, picking up reach numbers in hydrological order from RF1
  and retrieving the points of interest, if present, from the indexed database by
  reach numbers as the reaches are encountered in the navigation of RF1.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
