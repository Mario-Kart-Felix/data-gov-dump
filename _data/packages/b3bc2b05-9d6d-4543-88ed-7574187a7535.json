	"notes": "Hot structures fabricated from ceramic composite materials are an attractive design option for components of future high-speed aircraft, re-entry vehicles and propulsion systems to reduce weight and increase performance. One important detail in the design of such structures is that of joining and attachment. Large-area hot structures will likely be fabricated by mechanically joining smaller component sub-assemblies. Conventional metallic fasteners and fastening techniques do not provide structurally tight joints over a wide temperature range. A metallic fastener, which is snug at room temperature, will loosen at elevated temperature due to its relatively high thermal expansion. Excessive preloading at room temperature to maintain a tight joint at elevated temperature may be detrimental to the structural integrity of the joint. Ceramic composite fasteners on the other hand can be designed with near-perfect thermo-elastic compatibility with the adherends, however their prohibitively high cost to produce severely restricts their utility. The objective of this proposed program is to demonstrate the feasibility of a unique, cost-effective thermal stress-free ceramic composite mechanical fastener system suitable for assembly of high-temperature ceramic composite structures. The innovative fastener design facilitates joining load-bearing hot structural assemblies and can be produced at a cost much lower then other competing designs and methods. Ceramic composite fasteners will be produced and experimentally evaluated to determine the shear and tensile properties of the fasteners both individually and of respective lap-joined ceramic composite assemblies.rnrn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
