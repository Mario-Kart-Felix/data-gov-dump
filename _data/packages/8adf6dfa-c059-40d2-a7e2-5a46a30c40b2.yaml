    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "During nest monitoring in 1990, addled
    piping plover (Charadrius melodus) eggs were collected by staff of the New Jersey
    Department of Environmental Protection's Nongame and Endangered Species Program
    after it was apparent that they were not going to hatch (i.e., abandoned eggs, eggs
    still in nests well beyond the normal incubation period, etc.). Following the nesting
    season, all eggs were released to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in order to
    document organochlorine and heavy metal burdens in piping plover eggs and assess
    the implications of these residues for plover reproductive health. Addled piping
    plover eggs collected from coastal New Jersey have low level organochlorine contamination;
    although p,p'-DDE, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and chlordane metabolites were
    detected in all samples, the levels do not appear to threaten reproduction. The
    median concentration of p,p'-DDE was 0.66 ppm wet weight with a range of 0.20 to
    1.1 ppm. Total PCBs ranged from 3.3 to 6.9 ppm wet weight with a median concentration
    of 3.8 ppm. Total chlordane metabolites (sum of heptachlor epoxide, oxychlordane,
    trans-nonachlor, and cis-nonachlor residues) ranged from 0.08 to 0.33 ppm wet weight
    with a median of 0.18 ppm. Trans-nonachlor accounted for the largest proportion
    of total chlordane concentrations followed by oxychlordane, and heptachlor epoxide;
    cis-nonachlor was never a major contributor to total chlordane loading. Other organochlorines
    in the scan (a-BHC, b-BHC, r-BHC, d-BHC, r-chlordane, a-chlordane, endrin, mirex,
    o,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD, and p,p'-DDT) were not present above a 0.01
    ppm method detection limit; toxaphene was also below detection (<0.05 ppm) in all
    samples. Mercury concentrations ranged from 0.299 to 3.63 ppm dry weight with a
    median concentration of 0.512 ppm. Corrected for percent moisture, mercury concentrations
    in New Jersey piping plover eggs ranged from 0.077 to 1.07 ppm with a median concentration
    of 0.164 ppm wet weight. Most of the published literature on piping plovers attributes
    the initial cause of their demise to habitat loss and hunting, and the continuing
    limitation of their recovery to habitat loss from coastal development and disturbances
    such as pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and predation. With the exception of the
    mercury load in the eggs from Brick Township (1.07 ppm wet weight), the residues
    detected in this study appear below those thought causative of avian reproductive
    anomalies. Because the data indicate the possibility of greater contaminant burdens
    in eggs of piping plovers from breeding areas north of those in this study, additional
    analyses of addled plover eggs may be warranted. These analyses should focus on
    mercury and, potentially, isomer specific PCBs; there should also be an effort to
    include nest locations from north New Jersey (e.g., Sandy Hook) and southern New
    York (southern shore of Long Island) in order to assess the significance of the
    spatial trend in contaminant concentrations apparent from this study. Any decision
    to perform additional analyses should consider the overwhelming evidence that habitat
    loss and disturbance appear to be the primary limiting factors in plover recovery.",nt"owner_org":
