    necessary, near term, to construct a historical view of planetary significant events;
    as well as allow for the identification of materials useful for ISRU activities.
    Paramount to this is exploration missions capable of in-situ analysis of core samples
    that deliver the stratigraphy of the target. These sample handling technologies
    must be developed to meet a broad range of potential requirements, including a variety
    of rock or subsurface materials, rigorous sample preservation requirements, and
    the general problem of autonomous operation in the presence of dust and with limited
    resources. Honeybee seeks to develop critical subsystems for a small, low-mass,
    low-power Rotary-Percussive Corer (RoPeC) capable of autonomous sample acquisition
    and delivery from a depth of 5 cm. Specific attention will be given to the tall-pole
    items including the core break-off, retention, delivery, rotary-percussive drive,
    and gas flushing subsystems. Near term applications include the Astrobiology Field
    Laboratory and Mars Sample Return missions. Previous coring tool development has
    focused on integration and far-horizon proof of concepts; resulting in complete
    systems designed around specific requirements. The path forward lies in maturing
    specific aspects of designs quickly. The Phase 1 research has resulted in a survey
    of existing sampling systems as well as a conceptual design of the RoPeC with a
    focus on modularity. In Phase 2, Honeybee will mature the design of RoPeC subsystems;
    including the integration of a percussive voice coil actuator developed by the Jet
    Propulsion Laboratory for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Powder Acquisition Drill
    System. A focus on modularity will ensure that subsystems can be redesigned independently;
    enabling the acquisition of core samples in targets including MEPAG suggested rocks,
    MSL Mars analogs and Phoenix analogs. This will lead to the a TRL of 5-6.  ",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
