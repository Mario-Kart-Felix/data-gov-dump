		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

	"notes": "GMA Industries, Inc. proposes produce a lightweight, fully polymeric but intrinsically conducting hybrid material that can be applied towards the production of next-generation sealants, structures and components.  This will be achieved through the production of a single wall nanotube (SWNT)-containing matrix material, using wet chemistry processes and methods.  An ability to incorporate the significant electronic, mechanical, thermal properties, scattering- and optical-limiting properties of carbon nanotubes into a homogeneously dispersed covalently-bound structural matrix will provide a platform for the creation of a new class of composite matrices that addresses NASA's desire for multifunctional composite materials that harness superior thermal, mechanical, and optoelectronic efficiencies.  Furthermore, it is anticipated that a capability for real-time, in-situ monitoring of the structure's health can be incorporated within the architecture of these composites?whose susceptibility towards an assortment of phenomena (mechanical, chemical, optical, electrical, magnetic, etc.) can be further manipulated?through synthetic modifications of the SWNT component of the matrix.  No such carbon-nanotube derived material is currently available.  In Phase 1, the feasibility of producing such a composite will be demonstrated.  Phase II will involve the further process optimization, development, and full characterization of this material.",
