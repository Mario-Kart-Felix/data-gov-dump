	"notes": "XC Associates proposes to build on prior work to develop andncharacterize a very high efficiency, lightweight radiator constructednfrom high thermal conductivity carbon fibers.  The radiator will bensuitable for use on instruments carried by future spacecraft.  The phasenI effort will address the thermal performance and size limitations ofnthe composite design. Since cryogenic applications are becoming morencommon the thermal characteristics of the radiator will be measured downnto 45K. Modern spacecraft thermal control needs to be low mass and lowncost. Composite thermal radiators will realize a greater than 60&amp;#37; weightnsaving compared to aluminum and the costs can be addressed by the use ofnstandard technology that can be easily applied to new designs. The majorninnovation to be demonstrated by this project is the use of highlynorientated fibers that completely eliminates the low through thicknessnthermal conductivity normally associated with traditional carbon fibernlaminates. This highly oriented lay-up also allows the thickness of thenradiator to be tapered down to less than 0.020&amp;quot; while retainingnvery high stiffness.  Therefore, the radiator is much thinner than thenequivalent aluminum radiator, which combined with lower density ofncomposite construction, accounts for the significant weight reduction.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
