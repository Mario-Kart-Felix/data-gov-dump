  (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japan   satellite mission to monitor tropical and subtropical
  precipitation   and to estimate its associated latent heating.n                                    nThe
  primary objective of the 2A21 is to compute the path integrated attenuation (PIA),
  using the surface reference technique (SRT).  The SRT relies on the assumption that
  the difference between the measurements of the normalized surface cross section
  within and outside the rain provides a measure of the PIA. n                                    nTwo
  types of non-rain surface cross section (sigma-zero) reference estimates are used:
  spatial and temporal.  In the spatial surface reference data set, the mean and standard
  deviation of the surface cross sections are calculated over a running window of
  Ns fields of view before rain is encountered.  These operations are performed separately
  for each of the 49+2 incidence angles of TRMM (corresponding to the cross-track
  scan from -17 degrees to + 17 degrees with respect to nadir).  The two additional
  angle bins (making the total 51 rather than 49) are to account for non-zero pitch/roll
  angles that can shift the incidence angle with respect to nadir outside the normal
  range.n                                    nFor the temporal surface reference data
  set, the running mean and standard deviation are computed over a 1 degree x 1 degree
  (latitude, longitude) grid.  Within each 1 degree x 1 degree grid cell, the data
  are further categorized into incidence angle categories (26).  The number of observations
  in each category, Nt, are also recorded.  Note that, for the temporal reference
  data set, no distinction is made between the port and starboard incidence angles.
  \ So, instead of 49 incidence angles, there are only 25 + 1, where the additional
  bin corresponds to angles greater than the normal range. n                                    nWhen
  rain is encountered, the mean and standard deviations of the reference sigma-zero
  values are retrieved from the spatial and temporal surface reference data sets.
  \ To determine which reference measurement is to be used, the algorithm checks whether
  Nt >= Ntmin and Ns >= Nsmin, where Ntmin and Nsmin are the minimum number of samples
  that are needed to be considered a valid reference estimate for the temporal and
  spatial reference data sets, respectively. (Presently, Ntmin = 50 and Nsmin = 8).
  \ If neither condition is satisfied, no estimate of the PIA is made and the flags
  are set accordingly.  If only one condition is met, then the surface reference data
  which corresponds to this is used.  If both conditions are satisfied, the surface
  reference data is taken from that set which has the smaller standard deviation.n
  \                                   nIf a valid surface reference data set exists
  (i.e., either Nt >= Ntmin or Ns >= Nsmin or both) then the 2-way path attenuation
  (PIA) is estimated from the equation:n                                    nPIA  =
  <sigma-zero(reference value)> - sigma-zero(in rain)n                                    nwhere
  sigma-zero(in rain) is the value of the surface cross section over the rain volume
  of interest and <sigma-zero(reference value)> is the mean value obtained from either
  the temporal or spatial reference data sets, the choice of which depends on the
  considerations discussed above.n                                    nTo obtain information
  as to the reliability of this PIA estimate we consider the difference between the
  PIA, as derived in the above equation, and the standard deviation as calculated
  from the no-rain sigma-zero values and stored in the reference data set.  Labeling
  this as std dev(reference value), then the reliability factor of the PIA estimate
  is obtained from:n                                    nreliabFactor = PIA - std
  dev(reference value)n                                    nWhen this quantity is
  large, the reliability is considered high and conversely. This is the basic...\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
