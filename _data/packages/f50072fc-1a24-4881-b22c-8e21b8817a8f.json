	"notes": "The OMI/Aura Level-2 Total Column Ozone Data Product OMTO3 Near Real Time data is made available from the OMI SIPS NASA  for the public access.  The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)was launched aboard the EOS-Aura satellite on July 15, 2004(1:38 pm equator crossing time, ascending mode). OMI with its 2600 km viewing swath width provides almost daily global coverage. OMI is a contribution of the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programs (NIVR)in collaboration with Finish Meterological Institute (FMI), to the US EOS-Aura Mission. The principal investigator's (Dr. Pieternel Levelt) institute is the KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute). OMI is designed to monitor stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, clouds, aerosols and smoke from biomass burning, SO2 from volcanic eruptions, and key tropospheric pollutants (HCHO, NO2) and ozone depleting gases (OClO and BrO). OMI sensor counts, calibrated and geolocated radiances, and all derived geophysical atmospheric products will be archived at the NASA Goddard DAAC. This level-2 global total column ozone product (OMTO3)is based on the enhanced TOMS version-8 algorithm that  essentially uses the ultraviolet radiance data at 317.5 and 331.2 nm. OMI additional hyper-spectral measurements help in the corrections for the factors that induce uncertainty in ozone retrieval (e.g., cloud and aerosol, sea-glint effects, profile shape sensitivity, SO2 and other trace gas contamination). In addition to the total ozone values this product also contains some auxiliary derived and ancillary input parameters including N-values, effective Lambertian scene-reflectivity, UV aerosol index, SO2 index, cloud fraction, cloud pressure, ozone below clouds, terrain height, geolocation, solar and satellite viewing angles, and extensive quality flags. The shortname for this Level-2 OMI total column ozone product is OMTO3 and the algorithm lead for this product is NASA OMI scientist  Dr. Pawan K. Bhartia ( Pawan.K.Bhartia@nasa.gov). OMTO3 files are stored in EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (~53 minutes). There are approximately 14 orbits per day. The maximum file size for the OMTO3 data product is about 35 Mbytes. A list of tools for browsing and extracting data from these files can be found at: http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/tools.shtml For more information on Ozone Monitoring Instrument and atmospheric data products, please visit the OMI-Aura sites: http://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/  http://www.knmi.nl/omi/research/documents/ .        Data Category Parameters: The OMTO3 data file contains one swath which consists of two groups: Data fields: OMI Total Ozone,Effective Reflectivity (331 - 360 nm), N-value, Cloud Fraction, Cloud Top Pressure, O3 below Cloud, UV Aerosol Index, SO2 index, Wavelength used in the algorithm, many Auxiliary Algorithm Parameter and Quality Flags Geolocation Fields: Latitude, Longitude, Time, Relative Azimuth, Solar Zenith and Azimuth, Viewing Zenith and Azimuth angles, Spacecraft Altitude, Latitude, Longitude, Terrain Height, Ground Pixel Quality Flags.For the full set of Aura data products available from the GES DISC, please see the link http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/ .",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
