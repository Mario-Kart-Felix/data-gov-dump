	"notes": "The Nimbus-3 Medium-Resolution Infrared Radiometer (MRIR) Level 1 Meteorological Radiance Data contain radiances expressed as equivalent blackbody temperatures along with geolocation, time and other housekeeping information. These Nimbus-3 MRIR data are stored in a 36-bit IBM binary or TAP format (proprietary tape emulated format).\n\nThe Nimbus-3 satellite was launched on 14 April 1969, and is the follow-on experiment to the MRIR flown on Nimbus-2. MRIR was designed to measure electromagnetic radiation emitted and reflected from the earth and its atmosphere at 5 wavelengths. The five wavelengths regions are as follows:\n                  \n* 6.5 to 7.0 microns - This channel covers the 6.7 micron water vapor absorption band. Its purpose is to provide information on water vapor distribution in the upper troposphere and, in conjunction with the other channels to provide data concerning relative humidities at these altitudes.\n                  \n* 10 to 11 microns - Operating in an atmospheric \"window,\" this channel measures surface or near-surface temperatures over clear portions of the atmosphere.  It also provides cloud cover and cloud height information (day and night).\n                  \n* 14.5 to 15.5 microns - This channel, centered about the strong absorption band of C02 at 15 microns, measures radiation which emanates primarily from the stratosphere. The information gained here is of primary importance to in following seasonal stratospheric temperature changes.\n                  \n* 20 to 23 microns - This channel yields data from the spectral region containing the broad rotational absorption bands of water vapor. It will provide information similar to that of the 6.5 to 7.0 micron channel except that the flux will largely be radiated from lower in the atmosphere.\n                  \n* 0.2 to 4.0 microns - This channel covers more than 99% of the solar spectrum and yields information on the intensity of the reflected solar energy from the earth and its atmosphere.\n                  \nThe MRIR instrument was operational from May 15, 1966 through July 28, 1966. On September 25, 1970, the satellite's rear horizon scanner failed, making it impossible to determine where the MRIR sensor was pointing. The experiment was operated periodically until January 22, 1972, when all spacecraft operations were terminated.\n\nThese data were previously archived at NASA NSSDC as product NMRT-MRIR under the entry ID ESAD-00183 (originally 69-037A-05B).",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
