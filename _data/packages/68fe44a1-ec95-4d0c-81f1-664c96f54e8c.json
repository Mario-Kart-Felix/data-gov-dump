		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

	"notes": "For NASA and other organizations, development using reconfigurablentechnologies can be time consuming and difficult, with expensive tonover-budget development cycles and longer time-to-deployment. Thenproposed Q-Deploy  Processor and FPGA Rapid-Deployment Platform, withnthe endorsement of a leading prime who is heavily involved with NASAnprograms and allocations, will give NASA a standardized and commerciallynavailable system providing an environment and infrastructure fornaccelerated development and rapid deployment of highly reliablenapplications on reconfigurable computing platforms.  The Q-Deploy systemnwill leverage and extend proven reconfigurable software technologiesndeveloped under DOD contracts and promotes the development of reusablenand easily testable functions, with an expanding library of testednfeatures that address normal system-level functions and requirements.nThe existing technologies will be expanded for operation in TriplenModular Redundancy (TMR) soft-core processors within FPGA(s) to providenadded reliability for applications in environments such as those ofninterest to NASA.  This expansion enhances reliability, and whenncombined with other capabilities, enables the possibility of, fornexample, &amp;quot;replacing&amp;quot; a faulty processor in an operationalnsystem. Reliability will be further enhanced by providing the HardwarenObject Refresh Manager to refresh objects in a managed and prioritizednmanner to combat module failures due to, for example, radiation inducednbit swaps without the requirement of device reset or downtime.nQ-Deploy's innovative approach for reliable, rapid development andndeployment of reconfigurable technologies will provide a flexible,nmodifiable, and extendable platform usable by multiple developers fornNASA and other organizations.",
