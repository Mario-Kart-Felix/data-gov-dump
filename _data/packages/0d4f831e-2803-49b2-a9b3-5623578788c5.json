	"notes": "We conducted a series of studies to evaluate methods for laboratory culture and toxicity testing with the endangered desert pupfish, Cyprinodon macularius. This species may be exposed to hazardous levels of selenium in agricultural drains and shoreline pools in the Imperial Valley of California and the Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. Thirty-eight adult pupfish collected by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and shipped to the Columbia Environmental Research Center adapted readily to laboratory culture in well water adjusted to 10 parts per thousand (ppt) salinity and produced numerous offspring. Offspring were successfully reared to sexual maturity to provide additional brood stock, and both second and third generation offspring were used for acute toxicity tests and for development of methods for chronic toxicity tests. Acute (96-hr) toxicity tests were conducted in fresh water (conductivity 311 S/cm) with newly-hatched larvae (<24 hr old) and 3- to 6-month old juveniles (average length 29 mm) desert pupfish, and with comparable age groups of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), a species that has been widely used as a laboratory test organism. Acute toxicity differed widely among three chemical forms of selenium (selenate, selenite, and selenomethionine) and between fish species and age groups. For both species, toxicity generally increased in the order: selenate < selenite < selenomethionine. In tests with all three selenium forms, desert pupfish were generally less sensitive than fathead minnows, which are among the most sensitive aquatic taxa to acute toxicity of waterborne selenium. Lowest median lethal concentrations (LC50) for pupfish were 33 mg/L for selenate, 22 mg/L for selenite, and 0.43 mg/L for selenomethionine. The ranking of sensitivity among selenium species differed somewhat among age groups of desert pupfish, as larvae were more sensitive than juveniles to selenite and juveniles were more sensitive to selenate and selenomethionine than larvae. Newly-hatched pupfish performed well under typical test conditions for chronic toxicity tests, with virtually no mortality during a 90-d study conducted at a salinity of 5 ppt. Pupfish larvae thrived on a diet of live brine shrimp, and were able to switch to a diet of laboratory-cultured aquatic oligochaetes (Lumbriculus variegatus) after 48 days. Pupfish fed a diet that included oligochaetes grew more rapidly than those fed only brine shrimp and reached reproductive maturity by the end of the test. Pupfish from the oligochaete diet treatment that were transferred to a breeding tank began spawning immediately and produced large numbers of eggs during a three-week observation period. Hatching success (90%) and larval survival (96%) were excellent. Results of these studies indicate that desert pupfish are highly suitable for laboratory culture and toxicity testing, and that the rapid sexual maturation of this species should facilitate completion of life cycle testing (egg-larvae-juvenile-adult-F1) in a period of six months or less. For chronic laboratory toxicity tests to be realistic simulations of selenium exposure in contaminated habitats, these tests should include exposure to selenium via live diets. However, additional methods development will be necessary to characterize the uptake and bioavailability of selenium into potential live diets, such as brine shrimp and/or oligochaetes.",
