	"notes": "We propose that the Membrane Optical Shell Technology (MOST) substrate fabrication approach be extended with a specific focus on advanced off-axis very light weight, cost advantaged, optical surfaces for future telescope applications. The approach is based on a proven combination of 1) continuous thin film materials with space heritage, 2) inherent low areal density (40 to 200g/m2) surfaces, 3) cost and time advantaged fabrication techniques that 4) impart structural shell stiffness through the induction of permanent curvature, yielding 5) interferometrically confirmed optically sufficient low surface roughness and thickness variation and rapidly improving global figure metrics, 6) volume efficient stacking or compact roll stowage and robust passive self deployment, and when needed, 7) compatibility with boundary control/adjustment to provide initial phasing and reject environmental disturbances.  In the PI, building on our base of past research, we will demonstrate ability to directly fabricate the desired off axis segmented surfaces, continue to improve global figure metrics, address potential structural load survival and dynamic concerns, and begin to address other key issues critical toward improving TRL levels. This will prepare the way for a detailed PII ground demonstration and adoption into a flight program which is a key step in any realistic commercialization plan for space hardware. ",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
