    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "There are significant logistical barriers
    to entry-level high performance computing (HPC) modeling and simulation (M&amp;S)
    users. Performing large-scale, massively parallel computations on modern supercomputing
    platforms is a very challenging task in and of itself. It requires huge amounts
    of analyst resources to construct datasets, transfer files, build codes, submit
    and monitor jobs, and analyze and archive results. This workflow requires significant
    attention to detail, and it is easy to miss steps, set up incorrect file or directory
    structures for datasets, spend inordinate effort to understand each computing platform
    and its unique job submission requirements, and decide how and where to archive
    potentially terabytes of simulation results. Collaboration among engineers is hampered
    by non-centralized storage of results, permission issues, and the sheer size of
    simulation result sets. Even for seasoned, veteran HPC users, the complexity of
    the overall HPC use process can be a barrier to daily use. rnrnWe propose a system
    to streamline this workflow, provide audit trails for data used in simulations,
    code versions used, and storage locations of results, as well as integrating tools
    for file transfer, job submission, batch visualization, and other tasks that require
    engineer's time that is better spent considering the simulation itself. Further,
    the proposed SLMIR application (Simulation Lifecycle Management &amp;#150; IllinoisRocstar)
    sets up the infrastructure for collecting simulation data across an organization
    or organizations, so that engineers and scientists may discover information generated
    by others in their research areas, potentially saving time and money by leveraging
    previous work and avoiding duplication. The envisioned system targets users of HPC
    tools in the field, rather than developers writing those tools, since engineers
    and scientists in manufacturing and engineering industries are heavily invested
    in the results of using the tools.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
