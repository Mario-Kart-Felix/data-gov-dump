	"notes": "The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from then               U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB representsn               a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent datan               set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. A tribal census tract is a relatively permanent statistical subdivision of a federallyn               recognized American Indian reservation and/or off-reservation trust land, delineated by the American Indian tribal government and/or the Census Bureaun               for the purpose of presenting demographic data. For the 2010 Census, tribal census tracts groups are defined independently of the standard county-basedn               block group delineation. For federally recognized American Indian Tribes with reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands with a population less thann               2,400, a single tribal census tract is defined. Qualifying areas with a population greater than 2,400 could define additional tribal census tracts withinn               their area. The tribal census tract codes for the 2010 Census are six characters long with a leading "T" alphabetic character followed by a five-digitn               numeric code, for example, T01000, which translates as tribal census tract 10. Tribal block groups nest within tribal census tract. Since individualn               tabulation blocks are defined within the standard State-county-census tract geographic hierarchy, a tribal census tract can contain seemingly duplicaten               block numbers, thus tribal census tracts cannot be used to uniquely identify census tabulation blocks for the 2010 Census. For the 2010 Census, tribaln               block groups and tribal census tracts were delineated through the Tribal Statistical Areas Program (TSAP).",
