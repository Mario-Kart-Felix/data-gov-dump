    for the geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore of Half Moon Bay map area, California.
    The vector data file is included in "Faults_OffshoreHalfMoonBay.zip," which is
    accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreHalfMoonBay/data_catalog_OffshoreHalfMoonBay.html.
    The Offshore of Half Moon Bay map area lies about 12 km southwest of the San Andreas
    Fault, the dominant structure in the distributed, right-lateral, transform boundary
    between the North American and Pacific plates. The map area straddles the right-lateral
    San Gregorio Fault, the most important structure west of the San Andreas Fault in
    this broad zone. The San Gregorio is part of fault system that occurs predominantly
    in the offshore, extending about 400 km from Point Conception on the south to Bolinas
    and Point Reyes on the north (Dickinson and others, 2005), intersecting land at
    a few coastal promontories. In the Offshore of Half Moon Bay map area, the San Gregorio
    Fault forms a distributed shear zone about 2 to 4.5 km wide that includes two primary
    diverging fault strands. The eastern strand (also known as the Seal Cove Fault or
    Coastways Fault) roughly parallels the shoreline, lies onshore for about 3 km at
    Pillar Point, and locally forms the boundary between outcrops of Cretaceous grantic
    rocks to the east and Purisima Formation to the west. The western strand (also known
    as the Frijoles Fault) lies entirely offshore and forms a boundary between the Purisima
    Formation on the east and undifferentiated Cretaceous and (or) Tertiary rocks (Pigeon
    Point Formation?) of the Pigeon Point structural block (McCulloch, 1987) on the
    west. The Pigeon Point block forms a northwest-trending bedrock ridge that extends
    offshore for about 30 km from Pescadero Point and forms the northwest boundary of
    the outer Santa Cruz Basin (McCulloch, 1987). Cumulative lateral slip on the San
    Gregorio Fault zone is thought to range from 4 to 10 mm/yr in this region (U.S.
    Geological Survey, 2010). Bathymetric (Bathymetry--Offshore Half Moon Bay, California,
    DS 781) and seismic-reflection data (see field activity S-15-10-NC) reveal that
    the offshore outcrops of the Purisima Formation between the eastern and western
    strands of the San Gregorio Fault Zone are spectacularly folded, faulted and rotated
    by the strike-slip motion and drag along the faults. The entire map area lies along
    strike with the young, high topography of the Santa Cruz Mountains and Coast Ranges.
    This regional uplift has been linked to a northwest transpressive bend in the San
    Andreas Fault (for example, Zoback and others, 1999). Uplift of nearby marine terraces
    at rates up to 0.44 mm/yr confirms that this uplift includes the coastal zone (Weber
    and others, 1995). Faults were primarily mapped by interpretation of seismic reflection
    profile data (see field activity S-15-10-NC). The seismic reflection profiles were
    collected between 2007 and 2010. References Cited Dickinson, W.R., Ducea, M., Rosenberg,
