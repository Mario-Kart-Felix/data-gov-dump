  areas of science and engineering, and it has had tremendous impact for decades in
  areas such as aerospace, defense, energy, finance, and telecommunications?to name
  just a few.  Supercomputing enables many of our most important high-tech tools,
  and nowhere is it more important than at NASA, where attaining increased computing
  speed and performance at lower costs are constant objectives.  The goal of this
  multi-phase SBIR project is exactly that?to develop, validate, and commercialize
  next-generation supercomputing capabilities that provide NASA and other government/commercial
  users with massive increases in speed at minimal cost and with reduced energy requirements
  and  significant \"footprint\" efficiency.rnIn Phase I of this NASA SBIR project,
  Accelogic successfully demonstrated the feasibility of developing the world's first
  reconfigurable computing linear equation (banded) solver for large-scale computing
  problems?such as those seen in aerospace applications?with greatly increased speed
  using an FPGA chip.  The speed attained was equivalent to 240 CPU's per FPGA chip
  for banded systems?which represents nearly a 60x computing speedup (surpassing the
  50x Phase I target).  Accelogic's Phase I success sets the stage for a Phase II
  effort focused on prototyping/validating an initial supercomputing acceleration
  product.  The Phase II technical goal is to demonstrate the potential for 1,000x
  speedup.  rnDuring Phase I, Accelogic has proven it is ideally positioned to capitalize
  upon recent advances in reconfigurable computing?many of which were attained by
  Accelogic's own experts.  Applications for the products targeted by this project
  include many that are of interest to NASA, DOD, DOE, and many commercial entities.
  \ Based on Phase I results and the clear commercial potential, Accelogic has obtained
  interest/commitment letters from well-established commercial vendors and key NASA
  contractors, including Silicon Graphics. \",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S. Government

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
