    (LISA) is a joint NASA/ESA project which will use laser interferometry between drag-free
    proof masses to measure gravitational waves from many galactic and cosmological
    sources. The same interferometer technology is also the key to future multi-spacecraft
    missions such as multi-aperture telescope missions. These missions could include
    several spacecraft all separated by potentially 10s of km, flying in a fixed formation
    with sub-wavelength variations in their distances. These multi-aperture or distributed
    aperture telescopes will revolutionize the angular resolution in the infrared, optical,
    and even X-ray band.  This proposal addresses two components which are both critical
    to these missions.nnThe first component introduces a new technique to stabilize
    the laser frequency to an optical reference cavity. Laser frequency noise will be
    the limiting factor for most of the distributed aperture telescope missions; in
    contrast, LISA can trade frequency noise against ranging precision. This new technique
    is based on heterodyne interferometry which is also used to measure changes in the
    distances between the spacecraft. Because of this similarity, this  technology can
    easily be integrated into the payload. It requires the same photo detectors and
    digital signal processing systems that are used for the interferometry. It utilizes
    to a large degree existing components, reducing R&amp;D time and cost for all interferometric
    space missions. We have already started initial proof of principle experiments and
    have reached already a performance remarkably close to the performance of the standard
    and long time-favored modulation/demodulation technique. Now we propose to study
    this technique in more detail, study the limiting noise sources experimentally and
    theoretically, and push it to the limitations of the reference cavity itself. The
    expected final fractional frequency noise should be better than 0.01ppt for measurement
    times of a 1000s. This ",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
