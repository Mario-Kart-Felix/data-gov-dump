    give an overview of the approaches in building diagnostic solutions for networks
    and complex systems. The conventional rule-based approach and the top-down analysis
    will be compared with other innovative solutions based on information modeling and
    codebook correlation. One specific solution pioneered by research done in Columbia
    University and later implemented by SMARTS/EMC  will be presented in more detail
    as an example of a consistent approach to diagnostics. rnrn rnrnSpeaker:rnrnYuri
    Rabover, Ph.D. VMTurbornrnDr. Yuri Rabover, is a co-founder and Director of Product
    Strategy of VMTurbo, a startup in a stealth mode. Prior to VMTurbo Yuri spent 12
    years working for SMARTS as director of engineering, product management and technology
    partnership. After EMC acquired SMARTS for $275M in 2005, Yuri was managing the
    Advanced Solution Group in the EMC Corporate CTO Office developing prototypes and
    proof of concepts of new innovative solutions. He is a seasoned technologist, strategist
    and researcher in the wide area of system, network and storage management with more
    than 20 years of industry and academia experience.  ",nt"license_title": "U.S.

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
