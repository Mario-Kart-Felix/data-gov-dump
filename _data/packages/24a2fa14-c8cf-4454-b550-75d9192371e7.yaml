    "",ntt"description": "Critically stressed fault segments have a relatively
    high likelihood of acting as fluid flow conduits (Sibson, 1994). As such, the tendency
    of a fault segment to slip (slip tendency; Ts; Morris et al., 1996) or to dilate
    (dilation tendency; Td; Ferrill et al., 1999) provides an indication of which faults
    or fault segments within a geothermal system are critically stressed and therefore
    likely to transmit geothermal fluids. The slip tendency of a surface is defined
    by the ratio of shear stress to normal stress on that surface:nTs = u03c4 / u03c3n
    t(Morris et al., 1996).nDilation tendency is defined by the stress acting normal
    to a given surface:nTd = (u03c31-u03c3n) / (u03c31-u03c33) t(Ferrill et al., 1999).
    nSlip and dilation were calculated using 3DStress (Southwest Research Institute).nSlip
    and dilation tendency are both unitless ratios of the resolved stresses applied
    to the fault plane by ambient stress conditions. Values range from a maximum of
    1, a fault plane ideally oriented to slip or dilate under ambient stress conditions
    to zero, a fault plane with no potential to slip or dilate. Slip and dilation tendency
    values were calculated for each fault in the focus study areas at, McGinness Hills,
    Neal Hot Springs, Patua, Salt Wells, San Emidio, and Tuscarora on fault traces.
    As dip is not well constrained or unknown for many faults mapped in within these
    we made these calculations using the dip for each fault that would yield the maximum
    slip tendency or dilation tendency. As such, these results should be viewed as maximum
    tendency of each fault to slip or dilate. The resulting along-fault and fault-to-fault
    variation in slip or dilation potential is a proxy for along fault and fault-to-fault
    variation in fluid flow conduit potential.nStress Magnitudes and directionsnStress
    field variation within each focus area was approximated based on regional published
    data and the world stress database (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait
    et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2010; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and
    Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012; Moeck et al., 2010; Moos and Ronne, 2010
    and Reinecker et al., 2005) as well as local stress information if applicable. For
    faults within these focus systems we applied either a normal faulting stress regime
    where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax)
    which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin) or strike-slip
    faulting stress regime where the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) is larger than
    the vertical stress (sv) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (shmax
    >sv>shmin) depending on the general tectonic province of the system. Based on visual
    inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin we used magnitudes
    such that shmin/shmax = .527 and shmin/sv= .46, which are consistent with complete
    and partial stress field determinations from Desert Peak, Coso, the Fallon area
    and Dixie valley (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al.,
    2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2011; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes
    2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012). nnSlip and dilation tendency for the San Emidio
    geothermal field was calculated based on the faults mapped Tuscarora area (Rhodes,
    2011). The San Emidio area lies in the Basin and Range Province, as such we applied
    a normal faulting stress regime to the San Emidio area faults, with a minimum horizontal
    stress direction oriented 115, based on inspection of local and regional stress
    determinations, as explained above. This is consistent with the shmin determined
    through inversion of fault data by Rhodes (2011). Under these stress conditions
    north-northeast striking, steeply dipping fault segments have the highest dilation
    tendency, while north-northeast striking 60u00b0 dipping fault segments have the
    highest tendency to slip. Interesting, the San Emidio geothermal field lies in an
    area of primarily north striking faults, which have moderate dilation tendency and
    moderate to low slip tendency.",ntt"format": "ZIP",ntt"tracking_summary":
