	"notes": "This image represents a 4 meter interpolated bathymetric grid of a bank East of Fajardo, Puerto Rico. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in and around the Northeast Reserve from 3/05/2013 to 3/29/2013. Data was acquired with a hull mounted Kongsberg EM1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software, applying all relevant correctors (attitude, sound velocity, absorption coefficient). Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using Hypack 2013 acquisition software. The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependent on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.",
