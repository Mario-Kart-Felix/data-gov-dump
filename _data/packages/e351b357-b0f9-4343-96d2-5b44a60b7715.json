	"notes": "Efficient and stable clock signal generation requirements at extrementemperatures and high radiation are not met with the current solutions.nChronos Technology proposes to evaluate RTXO as a new and comprehensivensolution that simultaneously addresses the requirements of a reliablenclock source in extreme environments. RTXO utilizes the larger band-gap,nsmaller intrinsic carrier concentration, high radiation tolerance andnextreme temperature capabilities of Silicon Carbide (Sic-4H)nsemiconductor technology. We will validate (thru FEA &amp;amp; othernanalysis) the trade-offs of advanced, high-Q Quartz and Galliumnorthophosphate resonator material (in thickness shear mode resonance),nconfiguration, processing, electronic interface and a matched mechanicalnsupport structure. Packaging technology approach addresses the uniquenneeds of integrating an environmentally sensitive high-Q resonatornoperating in the same environment as the rest of the components.nSuitable processes will be evaluated to yield reliable and repeatablenmanufacturing of RTXO as a viable and real life solution. All thendifferent elements and processes identified in this solution must complynand dovetail in order for a compact, robust, mono-metallicallyninterconnected and hermetically sealed housing configurationn(interconnection) to encapsulate the assembly. RTXO technical objectivenis to deliver exceptional performance over temperature ranges fromn-100?C and exceeding 400?C and radiation exceeding 300Krad (TID).",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
