	"notes": "The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from then               U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB representsn               a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent datan               set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian (AIANNH) Areas Shapefile includes then               following legal entities: federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land areas, State-recognized American Indiann               reservations, and Hawaiian home lands (HHLs). The statistical entities included are Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), Oklahoma tribaln               statistical areas (OTSAs), tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs), and State designated tribal statistical areas (SDTSAs). Joint use areas are alson               included in this shapefile and mean that the area is administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes. The Census Bureaun               designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data. Note that tribaln               subdivisions and Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) are additional types of American Indian / Alaska Native areas stored by the Census Bureau,n               but are displayed in separate shapefiles because of how they fall within the Census Bureau's geographic hierarchy. The 2010 Census boundaries forn               federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands are as of January 1, 2010, as reported by the federally recognizedn               tribal governments through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The State of Hawaii's Office of Hawaiian Home Lands provided then               legal boundaries used in Census 2000 for the HHLs, but provided no updates since and none for the 2010 Census although there is strong evidence of HHLn               land acquisitions and large housing and commercial development on most HHLs. The boundaries for ANVSAs, OTSAs, and TDSAs were delineated for the 2010n               Census through the Tribal Statistical Areas Program (TSAP) by participants from the federally recognized tribal governments. The Bureau of Indian Affairsn               (BIA) within the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) provides the list of federally recognized Tribes and only provides legal boundary information whenn               the Tribes need supporting records, if a boundary is based on treaty or another document that is historical or open to legal interpretation, or whenn               another Tribal, State, or local government challenges the depiction of a reservation or off-reservation trust land. The boundaries for State recognizedn               American Indian reservations and for SDTSAs were delineated State governor appointed liaisons for the 2010 Census through the State American Indiann               Reservation Program and TSAP respectively.",
