    Geological Survey data release are data from a set of sediment cores acquired from
    the continental slope, offshore Los Angeles and the Palos Verdes Peninsula, adjacent
    to the Palos Verdes Fault. Gravity cores were collected by the USGS in 2009 (cruise
    ID S-I2-09-SC; http://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/fan_info.php?fan=SI209SC), and vibracores
    were collected with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's remotely operated
    vehicle (ROV) Doc Ricketts in 2010 (cruise ID W-1-10-SC; http://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/fan_info.php?fan=W110SC).
    One spreadsheet (PalosVerdesCores_Info.xlsx) contains core name, location, and length.
    One spreadsheet (PalosVerdesCores_MSCLdata.xlsx) contains Multi-Sensor Core Logger
    P-wave velocity, gamma-ray density, and magnetic susceptibility whole-core logs.
    One zipped folder of .bmp files (PalosVerdesCores_Photos.zip) contains continuous
    core photographs of the archive half of each core. One spreadsheet (PalosVerdesCores_GrainSize.xlsx)
    contains laser particle grain size sample information and analytical results. One
    spreadsheet (PalosVerdesCores_Radiocarbon.xlsx) contains radiocarbon sample information,
    results, and calibrated ages. One zipped folder of DICOM files (PalosVerdesCores_CT.zip)
    contains raw computed tomography (CT) image files. One .pdf file (PalosVerdesCores_Figures.pdf)
    contains combined displays of data for each core, including graphic diagram descriptive
    logs. This particular metadata file describes the information contained in the file
    PalosVerdesCores_CT.zip. All cores are archived by the U.S. Geological Survey Pacific
    Coastal and Marine Science Center.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
