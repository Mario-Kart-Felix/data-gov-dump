	"notes": "Sampling of storm-petrel eggs from St. Lazaria Island in 1992 and 1999, suggested that some birds may be accumulating polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at concentrations which exceed avian toxicity thresholds. This southeast Alaskan island is home to a large seabird colony and is part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. We sampled additional storm-petrel eggs in 2007, evaluating a suite of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and methylmercury (MeHg) to further define contaminants exposure in these seabirds. Our results show that storm-petrels on St. Lazaria Island accumulated some organic compounds and methylmercury and transferred these contaminants to their eggs. Egg contaminant residues represent the contaminants present in the bird\u2019s breeding territory mesopelagic diet (Hobson et al. 1997). Flame-retardants, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been reported in numerous Arctic species and in other seabirds (She et al., 2004) but were not detected in this study at or above the analytical detection limits (0.00676 to 0.0201 ppm wet weight.). Metals concentrations in our sampled eggs were not at levels that have been associated with lowered reproduction or other detrimental effects on birds (Eisler 1985a, 1985b, 1987, 1988, 1998; Heinz 1979; Whitworth et al. 1991). The highest total PCB concentration in the 2007 samples was 5.01 ppm wet weight with a mean of 1.33 ppm wet weight. In general, total PCB concentrations were greater in the 2007 samples than our previous years\u2019 samples and were similar to PCB concentrations reported in other Alaska seabird studies (Vander Pol et al. 2004; Vander Pol et al. 2009). Those investigations\u2019 PCB levels were generally lower than those reported in other literature. Methylmercury results from St. Lazaria eggs exceeded avian toxicity thresholds for this contaminant. However, comparison with mercury data from other seabird species\u2019 eggs indicates that St. Lazaria storm-petrel eggs have comparable methylmercury concentrations (Braune et al. 2001, Goodale 2008). Our results were also very similar to results from Leach\u2019s storm-petrel eggs in two Maine studies (Goodale et al. 2008, 2009). Based on the small number of samples collected to date, contaminants in storm-petrel eggs from St. Lazaria Island are at relatively low concentrations and do not represent a risk to this population. However, extrapolation from such a small sample size is difficult, particularly given the high variability within some of the existing samples. These results represent input of contaminants to the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem through atmospheric and oceanic transport from distant sources and serve as initial baseline for this species in Southeast Alaska. Although concentrations are primarily below toxic thresholds, our egg residues are greater for PCBs and some organochlorine compounds than data reported in storm-petrel eggs in the past decade from the Queen Charlotte Islands of British Columbia (Elliott and Noble 1993; Elliott et al. 1997) and from Eastern Canada in 1984 (Pearce et al. 1989). Future sampling of storm-petrels on St. Lazaria is recommended to examine long-term contaminant trends in these species, as pollution sources may change with time and the effects of climate change on contaminant exposure are unknown. Additional sampling of other storm-petrel colonies would be useful to determine if there is a geographical difference in contaminant loads. These data can be used to track contaminant trends in these species within the refuge. Spatial differences in colony contaminant concentrations may suggest different pollution sources pathways of contaminant transport.",
