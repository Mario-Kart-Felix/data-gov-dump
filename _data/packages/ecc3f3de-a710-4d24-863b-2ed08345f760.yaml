    from 35 Porites coral cores covering the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef,
    Australia. Data set contains 35 individual core data sets plus time series 1746-1982
    of average calcification rate for 10 of these sites. The Australian Institute of
    Marine Science began collecting cores from very large massive colonies of Porites
    on the Great Barrier Reef in the early 1980s. Such cores cannot normally be identified
    to species. The cores were mounted and sawn to remove slices that were about 6-7mm
    thick. All slices were X-rayed and skeletal density measured along a central track
    on each slice using a gamma densitometer. The high density portion of annual density
    bands in Porites from the Great Barrier Reef appears to form usually between October
    and March, the Southern Hemisphere summer. Peaks in the density profiles were successively
    counted backwards from the last (outermost or youngest) peak. Density was assumed
    to peak in January and the most recent peak was dated from the date of collection
    of the core. Dates were then assigned to all peaks in the series. Time series of
    the following skeletal growth parameters were then obtained: 1) Average annual density
    (g.cm-3) 2) Annual linear extension measured between high density peaks (cm.yr-1)
    3) Annual calcification (g.cm-2.yr-1_; the product of annual average density and
    annual linear extension. These data were obtained from coral cores taken at 35 sites
    on the Great Barrier Reef. The density profiles do not always display regular, obvious
    annual peaks and we could not be absolutely sure of the dating for some profiles.
    We consider there may be errors of + or - 2-3 years in the starting data of some
    of these series. File AIMS10CoreAvg.txt: Time series of average calcification rate
    is based on 10 Porites corals for 1746-1982: Jeannie River, Flinders Reef, Brook
    Island, Britomart Reef, Lodestone Reef, Wheeler Reef, Havannah Island, Hook Island,
    Sanctuary Reef, and Abraham Reef. 3 series are presented: 1) Annual average values
    expressed as standardized anomalies; each of the 10 series was converted to standardized
    anomalies with respect to 1934-1982 mean and sd; resulting series then averaged
    for 10 corals. 2) Annual average standardized anomales filtered with 5-year gaussian
    filter. 3) Annual average series converted to original calcification units (g.cm-2.yr-1)
    filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. Because of potential dating errors the last
    two series are considered to be most reliable. Lough and Barnes (1997) suggest that
    ~30% of the variance in the 10-coral calcification series can be explained by variations
    of annual sea-surface temperature.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
