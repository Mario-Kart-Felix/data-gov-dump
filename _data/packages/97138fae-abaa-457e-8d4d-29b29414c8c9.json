	"notes": "ElectroChem proposes to develop oxidation resistant, electricallynconductive, hydrophilic coatings in PEM fuel cells and in PEMnelectrolyzers.  The use of hydrophilic coatings can improve thentransport of the water within the cells resulting in highernelectrochemical performance. However, the successful development ofnoxidation resistant hydrophilic coatings will be the key requirement duento the fuel cell and electrolyzer oxidation environment Oxidationnresistant coatings will be developed on metal substrates using bothninorganic and organic coating processes using conductive hydrophilicnmaterials.   In these processes, cross-linking of the inorganic andnorganic materials with the metallic substrate is a key to successfullynobtaining coatings with excellent performance and durability.  Advancednmethods will be developed to control the degree of cross-linking andnretaining hydrophilicity in order to obtain the required oxidationnresistance for the electrically conductive, hydrophilic coatings. Allncoatings developed in Ph I will be tested for oxidation resistance,nconductivity, and hydrophilic character.  In Ph II, the most promisingncoatings will be evaluated via their performance in PEM non-flow-throughnfuel cells and in electrolyzers.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
