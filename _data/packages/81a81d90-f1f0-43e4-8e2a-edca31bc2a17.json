	"notes": "The proposed innovation is a self-contained, self-powered, robust flight test sensor array for the determination of separation.  The proposed system uses off the shelf, currently available technology to create a reusable distributed sensor array, which requires no external wiring or power source.  The system is based on a novel instrumented tuft technology.  A distributed array of tuft sensors are embedded in a flexible, self-adhesive backed sheet of polymide substrate.  The proposed separation sensor array will provide real-time, accurate determination of separation across a wide range of flight conditions.  The self-contained blanket array can be quickly and easily applied to aircraft surfaces in question.  No wiring, external power, or remote viewing is required for acquisition.  After testing is complete, the system can be quickly removed and reused.  Additionally, the system could be miniaturized for use in ground test facilities or applied to other types of vehicles.  The proposed separation sensor array promises to provide a realizable, accurate, efficient, and cost effective measurement system.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
