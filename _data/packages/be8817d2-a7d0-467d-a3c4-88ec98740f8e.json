	"notes": "High-performance, radiation-hard, widely-tunable integrated laser/modulator chip and large-area avalanche photodetectors (APDs) are key components of optical transmitters and receivers that can dramatically lower the barriers to deployment and operation of high capacity in-space optical communication links.  Agility Communications develops and manufactures widely-tunable CW sources and transmitters based on chip-scale integration of a Sampled-Grating Distributed Bragg Reflector (SG-DBR) laser with an Electroabsorption or Mach-Zehnder modulator. The performance characteristics of these devices include 40 nm wavelength coverage, multi- Gigabit/sec data rates, low drive voltage, and compatibility with high spectral efficiency and high-sensitivity modulation formats. Agility has licensed low-noise APD structures patented at the University of Texas at Austin.  These devices have achieved record-setting noise and gain-bandwidth performance and are ideally suited for space-based, high-bandwidth optical links.  During Phase I of this project we will study the effects of proton irradiation for SG-DBR lasers, InGaAsP bulk electroabsorption and electro-optic modulators, and APDs with InAlAs multiplication structure. Based on the results of Phase I, optimum chip design and process technology will be selected for development of small, efficient, radiation-hard integrated optical components in Phase II of the project.rnrn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
