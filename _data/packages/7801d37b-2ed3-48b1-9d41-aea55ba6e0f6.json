	"notes": "This Directory Interchange Format (DIF) describes a collection of fields for the GPM Level 3 IMERG  *Final* Half Hourly 0.1 x 0.1 degree V03 (GPM_3IMERGHH) at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC).nnThe Integrated Multi-satelliE Retrievals for GPM (*IMERG*) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides  the  Day-1  multi-satellite  precipitation  product  for  the  U.S.  GPM  team.     The precipitation  estimates  from  the  various  precipitation-relevant  satellite  passive  microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2014 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2014), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Instrument product, and combined into half-hourly 0.1u00b0x0.1u00b0 fields.  These are provided to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter  (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks u2013 Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme.  In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated u201ceven-oddu201d geo- IR fields and forward them to PPS for use in the CMORPH-KF Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the PERSIANN-CCS computation routines.   The PERSIANN-CCS estimates are computed (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) and sent to the CMORPH-KF Lagrangian time interpolation scheme.   The CMORPH-KF Lagrangian time interpolation (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates.  The IMERG system is run twice in near-real timennu2022    u201cEarlyu201d multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time andnu2022    u201cLateu201d multi-satellite product ~12 hr after observation time,nnand once after the monthly gauge analysis is receivednnu2022     u201cFinalu201d satellite-gauge product ~2 months after the observation month.nnThe baseline is for the (near-)real-time Early and Late half-hour estimates to be calibrated with climatological coefficients that vary by month and location, while in the Final post-real-time run the multi-satellite half-hour estimates are adjusted so that they sum to a monthly satellite-gauge combination.   In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality.nnRelease document:nhttp://pmm.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/document_files/IMERG_FinalRun_Day1_release_notes.pdfnnOther key documents:nnTechnical document and acronyms:nhttp://pmm.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/document_files/IMERG_doc.pdfnnAlgorithm Theoretical Basis Document: nhttp://pmm.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/document_files/IMERG_ATBD_V4.4.pdfnnIn brief, the input precipitation estimates computed from the various satellite passive microwave sensors are intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Instrument product (because it is presumed to be the best snapshot GPM estimate), then u201cmorphedu201d and combined with microwave precipitation-calibrated geo-IR fields, and adjusted with monthly surface precipitation gauge analysis data (where available) to provide half-hourly and monthly precipitation estimates on a 0.1u00b0 lat./long. grid over the domain 60u00b0N-S. Precipitation phase is diagnosed using analyses of surface temperature, humidity, and pressure. The current period of record is mid-March 2014 to the present (delayed by about 2 months).The Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) algorithm is designed to leverage the international constellation of precipitation-relevant satellites to create a long record of uniformly time/space gridded precipitation estimates for the globe. The algorithm is focused on creating the best estimate at each time step, meaning that it is not a Climate Data Record, although the ideal is as homogenous a record as possible.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
