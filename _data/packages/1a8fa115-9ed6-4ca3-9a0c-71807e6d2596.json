	"notes": "The innovations proposed by ResearchSouth are: 1) a robust method to automatically insert high quality anisotropic prismatic (viscous boundary layer) cells into any existing CFD mesh; and 2) a robust unstructured mesh movement method able to handle isotropic (Euler), anisotropic (viscous), and mixed element grids for CFD applications, particularly, CFD-based design optimization. ResearchSouth is proposing to develop efficient, design-oriented application software that will significantly impact the current practice of computational design and analysis of aerospace vehicles. The most overlooked?and arguably the most enabling?technical aspect associated with the rapidly maturing CFD-based design optimization is mesh movement, especially for high Reynolds number viscous flow applications. CFD analysis based on unstructured grid technology is becoming the preferred approach for flow analysis of geometrically complex configurations. However, in the area of mesh movement and viscous mesh generation, the unstructured grid arena has experienced near paralysis for several years. We are proposing research that will provide robust solutions to both of these challenges and, thus, will provide air vehicle designers access to the full potential of unstructured grid technologies for performing design optimization as well as highly efficient "what-if-and-reanalyze" geometric modifications.rnrnrn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
