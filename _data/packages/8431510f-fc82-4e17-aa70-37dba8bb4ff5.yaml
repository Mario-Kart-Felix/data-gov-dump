  geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore of Point Reyes map area, California.
  The vector data file is included in \"Faults_OffshorePointReyes.zip,\" which is
  accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshorePointReyes/data_catalog_OffshorePointReyes.html.
  Faults in the Point Reyes map area are identified on seismic-reflection data based
  on abrupt truncation or warping of reflections and (or) juxtaposition of reflection
  panels with different seismic parameters such as reflection presence, amplitude,
  frequency, geometry, continuity, and vertical sequence. The Point Reyes Fault Zone
  runs through the map area and is an offshore curvilinear reverse fault zone with
  predominantly north-side-up motion (Hoskins and Griffiths, 1971; McCulloch, 1987;
  Heck and others, 1990; Stozek, 2012) that likely connects with the western San Gregorio
  fault further to the south (Ryan and others, 2008), making it part of the San Andreas
  Fault System. The Point Reyes Fault Zone is characterized by a 5 to 11 km-wide zone
  of deformation in the shallow subsurface that is associated with two main fault
  structures, the Point Reyes Fault and the western Point Reyes Fault. Near the Point
  Reyes headland, vertical displacement of granitic basement across the Point Reyes
  Fault is at least 1.4 km (McCulloch, 1987). Offshore Double Point, vertical displacement
  on the Point Reyes Fault is difficult to assess because subsurface age constraints
  from nearby wells are lacking, and there are few offset horizons across the fault
  imaged on available seismic data. However, warping and folding of Neogene strata
  are clearly visible on high-resolution seismic data . The western Point Reyes Fault
  is defined by a broad anticlinal structure visible in both industry and high-resolution
  seismic datasets that exhibits that same sense of vergence (north-side-up) as the
  Point Reyes Fault. Faults were primarily mapped by interpretation of seismic reflection
  profile data (see field activity S-8-09-NC). The seismic reflection profiles were
  collected in 2009. References Cited Heck, R.G., Edwards, E.B., Kronen, J.D., Jr.,
