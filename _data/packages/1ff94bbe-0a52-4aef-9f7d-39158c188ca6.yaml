    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The continued development of automated sample
    acquisition and handling tools is of critical importance to future robotic missions
    on Mars, the Moon, Venus, and other planetary bodies. In response to the need for
    a compact, low mass, low power, and low weight-on-bit coring device, Honeybee Robotics
    proposes to continue development of an arm-deployed and arm-stabilized rotary-percussive
    coring tool. By using a robotic arm to deploy the coring tool into rock or soil
    targets and stabilize the tool while operating, the coring tool's internal deployment
    (or "z") axis and external stabilization devices can be removed, resulting in
    a more compact, lower mass device. Also, adding percussion to the coring tool will
    reduce average weight-on-bit and energy consumption over the duration of the coring
    operation. The flexibility afforded from a rover or lander arm to target outcroppings,
    and the relatively higher TRL of surface coring tools (vs. deeper subsurface drills),
    make surface coring, especially with an arm-deployed coring tool, a particularly
    attractive option for near term planetary exploration. rnrnDuring Phase I, a preliminary
    coring tool design was developed that weighs less than 5 kg and meets all of the
    current MSR requirements. Breadboard testing also demonstrated the feasibility of
    arm-deployed and stabilized coring. rnrnThe objectives of Phase II are to further
    develop, demonstrate and characterize a TRL 5/6 MSR-compatible coring tool. The
    rotary-percussive coring tool will weigh less than 5 kg, be arm-deployed and stabilized,
    include a passive linear feed device, require less than 50 N weight-on-bit, produce
    and capture 1 cm diameter by 5 cm long cores, accommodate active bit change-out
    and passive bit release, and positively retain cores in core tubes when removed
    from the bit. The coring tool will be fully demonstrated and characterized at ambient
    and Mars conditions. rn",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
