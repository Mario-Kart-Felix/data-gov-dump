	"notes": "DSS proposes to systematically mature, mitigate risk for; and perform hardware-based ground validations / demonstrations of a low-cost, high technology payoff, ISS-based flight experiment that will allow key relevant space-flight environmental validation of our innovative Roll-Out Solar Array (ROSA) technology.  The ROSA flex-blanket solar array technology provides game-changing affordability and performance, and delivers a performance paradigm shift in terms of: significantly lower cost, greater specific power, more compact stowage volume, higher structural performance, less complexity, and  more modularity / scalability than state-of-the-art solar arrays.  A critical aspect of readying the enabling ROSA technology for infusion into potential end-user applications is to increase the TRL to 7+ via test / analytical validation of hardware in a relevant spaceflight environment for: Deployment, Deployed Dynamics and Photovoltaic Power Production. The ISS provides a ready and cost-effective relevant space environment (zero-G, vacuum and solar illumination/thermal) test-bed for the validation of these key technology areas via the straightforward flight experiment proposed. The Phase 2 effort is intended to lead to the definition of a comprehensive and test-validated ISS-based ROSA experiment design and operations plan that will facilitate / accelerate an ISS experiment manifest / review / approval process to significantly shorten the time to flight. The program includes: comprehensive risk mitigation for the flight experiment that includes hardware-based testing / ground simulation of experiment operations (including ISS structure and robotic arm interfaces) with functional and flight-like experiment hardware and generation of documentation to facilitate ISS flight experiment board requirements, integration, operations and safety reviews.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
