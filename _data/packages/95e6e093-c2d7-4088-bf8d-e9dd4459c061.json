	"notes": "Significant challenges remain for the designers of life support equipment for spacecraft&amp;#151;primarily for the processing of aqueous fluids: oxygen supply, air revitalization, thermal management systems, water reclamation, medical fluids, and others. The main problem is that failure-prone processes are often employed to overcome unfamiliar microgravity fluidic phenomena using artificial buoyancy-inducing methods. The most obvious example is a mechanical centrifuge for liquid-gas separations aboard orbiting spacecraft. To improve NASA's spacecraft fluid systems design, InnoSense LLC (ISL) proposes to develop Superhydrophilic Coatings for Embedded Capillary Systems (SPHIL-EMCAP) with anti-microbial properties. In Phase I, ISL will design and fabricate a complex capillary solution for spacecraft fluid management. The geometric design will exploit the current state of the art in analytical and computational capillary fluidics. Devices will be coated with SPHIL-EMCAP and evaluated for substrate adhesion, water contact angles, wear, and environment robustness, before testing in the relevant low-g environment to assess the improved capillary control afforded by the superhydrophilic coatings. In Phase II, ISL will downselect materials and applications, and optimize SPHIL-EMCAP's performance by refining the prototyping process and optimizing the superhydrophilic coating formulation. We will perform extensive characterization toward manufacturing a miniaturized SPHIL-EMCAP.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
