    Program (CRCP) long-term goals for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, towed-diver surveys (AKA towboard surveys) are conducted by the
    Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science
    Center (PIFSC) as part of Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP)
    Cruises. 4 towboard surveys (totaling 9.46 km in length) were conducted at Aguijan
    in Marianas from 20110407 to 20110509 as part of RAMP Cruise HA1101. Towboard surveys
    are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing
    the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances
    (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates
    (e.g., crown of thorns sea stars, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these
    populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish diver and 1 benthic diver)
    are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth
    of approximately 15 m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat,
    and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the
    lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (greater than 50 cm total length)
    seen within 5 m either side and 10 m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual
    is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing
    digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent
    cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and
    censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including crown of thorns sea stars
    and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital
    still camera which images the benthos at 15-second intervals. These images are analyzed
    for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards
    are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5-second
    intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15-second
    intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat.
    A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers
    with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of
    the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length
    of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track.
    This metadata applies to the fish biomass observations.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
