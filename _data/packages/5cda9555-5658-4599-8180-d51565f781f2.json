	"notes": "This data set provides four data files containing net primary productivity (NPP) data, edaphic characteristics, average climatic conditions, and basic descriptive and quantitative information on vegetation for 117 globally-distributed terrestrial forest sites. The data set was derived from the IBP (International Biological Programme) Woodlands Data Set of DeAngelis et al. (1981). The data were collected from the mid 1950s to the early 1970s and were compiled into an electronic data set at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to facilitate comparisons involving the diverse woodland ecosystems. One data file provides a complete synthesis of NPP, vegetation, edaphic, and climate data and data-source references for each of the 117 sites as published in DeAngelis et al. (1981) for a total of 5,887 records. The second file provides site location, biome, and selected forest productivity and soils data for the 117 sites. The third file provides summary climate data (temperature, precipitation, radiation, growing season length) for each site, and the fourth file provides forest type, investigator(s), and years of the study for each site. Revision Notes: Only the documentation for this data set has been modified. The data files have been checked for accuracy and are identical to those originally archived in 1997 (DeAngelis, et al, 1997.) ",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
