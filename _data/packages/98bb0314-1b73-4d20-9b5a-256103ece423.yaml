  are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census
  Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and
  Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed
  for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with
  the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain
  the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas
  may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available
  as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.nnThe
  records in this file allow users to map the parts of the 114th Congressional Districts
  that overlap a particular county.nnCongressional Districts are the 435 areas from
  which people are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.  After the apportionment
  of congressional seats among the states based on census population counts, each
  state is responsible for establishing congressional districts for the purpose of
  electing representatives.  Each congressional district is to be as equal in population
  to all other congressional districts in a state as practicable.  The 114th Congress
  is seated from January 2015 to 2017. The TIGER/Line shapefiles for the District
  of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth
  of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) each contain a single
  record for the non-voting delegate district in these areas.  The boundaries of all
  other congressional districts are provided to the Census Bureau through the Redistricting
  Data Program (RDP).nnThe primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties.
  \ In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes.  In Alaska, which has no
  counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs,
  municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas.  The latter are delineated
  cooperatively for statistical purposes by the state of Alaska and the Census Bureau.
  \ In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more
  incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute
  primary divisions of their states.  These incorporated places are known as independent
  cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation.
  \ The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is
  considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation.  The Census Bureau
  treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation:
  Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities
  in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin
  Islands.  The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas
  is covered by counties or equivalent entities.nnThe boundaries for counties and
  equivalent entities are mostly as of January 1, 2013, primarily as reported through
  the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  However, some changes
  made after January 2013, including the addition and deletion of counties, are included.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
