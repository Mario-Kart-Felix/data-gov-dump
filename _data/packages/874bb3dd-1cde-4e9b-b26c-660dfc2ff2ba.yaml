    is proposed for the Kensington Mine, located on Lynn Canal in Southeast Alaska,
    approximately 45 miles north of Juneau. The adjacent Jualin Mine is in the exploration
    phase. Over a ten-year period, various scenarios have been proposed for the Kensington
    Mine, including the cyanidation process to extract gold from crushed ore-bearing
    rock, a tailings pond for tailings disposal above anadromous fish streams, mixing
    zones for excess tailings water into fresh and/or marine waters, dry upland tailings
    storage, and most recently, submarine tailings disposal, and on-site process water
    treatment. The Kensington Mine is located adjacent to marine waters that support
    large numbers of migratory waterfowl, salmon, and herring. There are few baseline
    data on metals in local organisms available to compare with later monitoring data
    if this and other mines become operational. The object of this study is to produce
    a set of data to be used as a pre-development baseline for metal and cyanide concentrations
    in sediments and biota from potentially affected areas near Kensington and adjacent
    mining properties. Marine sediment was collected in 1994 from two coastal locations
    and blue mussels (Mytilus trossulus) were taken from six locations adjacent to the
    Kensington Mine site. Total metals and cyanide analyses were done for all samples.
    Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma) and prickly sculpin (Cottus asper) were collected
    from Sherman and Sweeny Creeks, which flow through the Kensington Mine site. Metal
    concentrations in sediments (mean concentrations in ppm dry weight [DW]: As 9.65,
    Cd <0.1, Cr 24.41, Cu 43.94, Hg 0.027, Ni 17.75, Pb 6.07, Zn 47.24) were comparable
    to other Southeast Alaska locations that have not been affected by human activities.
    Cyanide concentrations (mean of 0.07 ppm DW) were close to the level of detection
    in all marine sediment samples. Metal concentrations in blue mussels were also comparable
    to those in mussels from other Southeast Alaska locations with the exception of
    cadmium. Cadmium concentrations (mean of 9.95 ppm DW) were higher than any concentrations
    previously reported from Southeast Alaska mussels. Composite samples of Dolly Varden
    and sculpin arsenic concentrations (1.88, 1.37 ppm DW, respectively) were higher
    than expected when compared to fish from other Southeast Alaska locations, but reflect
    naturally high arsenic levels reported in water from Sweeny and Sherman Creeks collected
    by Coeur Alaska. Other freshwater fish metal concentrations were similar to those
    reported in previous baseline studies from Southeast Alaska. These data will provide
    partial baseline data prior to any mine development.",nt"license_title": "License
