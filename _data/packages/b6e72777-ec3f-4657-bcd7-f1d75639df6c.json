	"notes": "For this award, Tyvak proposes to develop a complete suite of avionics for a Nano-Launch Vehicle (NLV) based on the architecture determinations performed during Phase I. This system will address the unique avionics challenges of a dedicated small launch vehicle and will utilize heritage and lessons learned from Tyvak's CubeSat avionics systems, modifying and optimizing its existing products for use with this new class of launch vehicles. The major technical objectives are: rn- Provide broad compatibility with all known NLV systems in development rn- Determine and provide appropriate performance and reliability metrics while maintaining the low-cost/low-mass approach made possible by commercial electronic systems rn-tImplement the latest network protocols with support for wireless systems in the NLV environment rn- Develop a GPS metric tracking system and perform requirement verification to meet  range safety recommendationsrn- Demonstrate the reliability of low-cost/low-mass/low-power/redundant automatic flight termination system (AFTS) by combining the latest generation of commercial miniature GPS systems with high performance computer systems currently used by Tyvakrn- Validate functionality and performance for the entire NLV avionics suite through a series of incremental tests, from vibration and thermal vacuum, through a stratospheric balloon flight, an inert test article flight, to final demonstration on a NLV proxy.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
