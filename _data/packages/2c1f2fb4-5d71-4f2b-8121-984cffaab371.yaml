    except Kenai include u201ccontinued use for subsistence activitiesu201d as a defined
    refuge purpose under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Contaminant
    burdens in fish and wildlife species used for subsistence can limit or preclude
    the continued opportunity for traditional subsistence activities on these refuges.
    Northern pike (Esox lucius) are heavily used subsistence foods on NWRs in Alaska,
    and have mercury concentrations that often exceed critical values for human consumption.
    However, few NWR managers in Alaska have data sets on mercury in pike and other
    fish that would allow them to manage for continued subsistence uses and to mitigate
    hazards from consumption of those fish. To address this lack of data, we conducted
    a multi-year, systematic sampling for mercury and methyl-mercury in northern pike
    on the largest refuges in western and interior Alaska: Yukon Delta, Selawik, Koyukuk,
    Nowitna, Innoko and Yukon Flats NWRs. From 2005- 2007, we collected 440 northern
    pike from these Refuges, in six major watersheds. Sample sites were traditional
    and well-used subsistence fishing locations, identified by local residents. Pike
    were collected during the time of year that they were normally collected for subsistence
    purposes, either in the spring (caught through the ice during spawning migration)
    or summer (caught in open water, post-spawning). Fish were necropsied and an approximately
    10 g muscle sample was analyzed for mercury. Methyl mercury was analyzed in about
    a third of all samples. Mercury and methyl mercury were correlated in fish muscle,
    allowing calculation of a robust MeHg:THg ratio (0.96). Mercury was also correlated
    with fish length. We compared average calculated (based on the MeHg:THg ratio) methyl
    mercury concentrations from Refuges and watersheds to State consumption advisory
    values for mercury and found that some consumption advice was warranted, especially
    on the lower Yukon River in the Yukon Delta NWR. Mercury concentrations in pike
    muscle were of no apparent concern for fish health. These data will help Refuge
    managers provide continued subsistence opportunities and mitigate potential hazards
    associated with mercury in northern pike, a commonly used subsistence food. These
    data can also be used as baseline biomonitoring data for NWRs in Alaska, as mercury
    deposition, mobilization, and transport is likely to increase in light of increasing
    industrialization upwind of Alaska and in response to climate change.",nt"license_title":
