    collisions is the first priority for safe operations of the Space Station Remote
    Manipulator System (SSRMS).&amp;nbsp; This depends on the ability of the crew and
    flight controllers to verify enough clearance exists between the SSRMS, its payload,
    and surrounding structure.&amp;nbsp; In the plan, train, and fly stages of each
    mission significant time is spent developing, documenting, and executing a camera
    plan that allows each portion of the SSRMS trajectory to be monitored.&amp;nbsp;
    This time could be decreased and operational situational awareness increased by
    using an array of cameras mounted around a boom on the SSRMS that point along a
    boom.&amp;nbsp; The output of the these cameras could be stitched together to provide
    a one composite view that provides clearance monitoring 360&amp;deg; around the
    boom.&amp;nbsp; Further, this technology could be used in any application where
    it is desirable to see proximity on two or more sides of an object - surgery, tele-robotics,
    deep sea exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This investigation will ask operators (crew
    and flight controllers) to compare clearance monitoring of a sample trajectory using
    conventional external camera sources versus a stitched video presentation from a
    camera array.&amp;nbsp; A test plan, script, and scoring for comparison will be
    used to determine if stitched camera arrays lend themselves to clearance monitoring.&amp;nbsp;
    The project investigator&amp;nbsp;researched the required technology, including
    hardware and software, to perform video stitching&amp;nbsp;to identify an approach
    that can be used for operator evaluation in the ICA project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial
    (Innovation Charge Account Project (ICA)) results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cadre of
    robotics professionals from JSC Robotics Operations and Astronaut Office participated
    in a benchmarking effort to quantify efficiency and safety metrics both with and
    without the use of a stitched camera array. &amp;nbsp;A modified Cooper-Harper scale
    was used to determine operator workload. &amp;nbsp;Other metrics included time required
    to perform task, motion stopped due to lack of clearance views, whether contact
    was made with external structures. &amp;nbsp;Results showed a reduced operator workload,
    faster completion of the task, and reduced contact with external structure. &amp;nbsp;Additionally,
    the technology was presented to the JSC community at Innovation Day 2012 where it
    won the People&amp;#39;s Choice Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second Phase:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rearranging
    image pixels from multiple cameras to accomplish a perspective shift is computationally
    expensive.&amp;nbsp; In the last decade, advances in CPU performance and direct
    to memory image capturing methods have improved the frame rate and latency associated
    with video stitching.&amp;nbsp; In&amp;nbsp;the previous phase&amp;nbsp;(FY &amp;rsquo;12
    ICA, People&amp;rsquo;s Choice Winner), &amp;nbsp;the collaborator was able to achieve
    10 frames per second with less than a second latency using off the shelf CPU and
    camera hardware. &amp;nbsp;The purpose of Phase 2 is to demonstrate the technology
    on a larger vehicle (Multi-Mission Space Exploration vehicle) using high-bandwidth
    (GigE) network, increased CPU/GPU resources, and high-performance cameras.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second
    Phase Results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten video cameras (the minimum required to obtain
    coverage around the vehicle while providing enough image overlap) were placed around
    the upper surface of the MMSEV.&amp;nbsp; The video streams were piped to an on-board
    high-end PC where software written in MATLAB performed the perspective shifts and
    homographic alignment.&amp;nbsp; The resulting single view was displayed in Graphical
    User Interface (GUI) that allowed the operator to see the composite &amp;lsquo;birds-eye&amp;rsquo;
    view or zoom in on a view from a particular camera when clearance was a concern.&amp;nbsp;
    The MMSEV was maneuvered around the simulated Martian landscape at JSC known as
    the Rock Pile.&amp;nbsp; To date the maximum achieved frame rate is 2 frames per
    second.&amp;nbsp; To increase frame rate current efforts are focused on transferring
    the homographic algorithms to a Xylinx field-programmable gate array (FPGA) processor.

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
