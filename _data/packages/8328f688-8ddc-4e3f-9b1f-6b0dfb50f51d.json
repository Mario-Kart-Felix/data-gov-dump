	"notes": "The nesting population of greater sandhill cranes on Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon has declined from 181 pairs in 1986 when predator control began to 137 pairs in 1988. The peak refuge population was 236 pairs in 1971. Some of the most recent decline is attributed to lost habitat on Mud, Malheur and Harney Lakes due to record high lake levels (17 pairs) and droughts in 1987 and 1988 (10 pairs). Losses on Mud, Malheur, and Harney lakes had already taken place by 1986 but could not be verified until a comprehensive pair count was done in 1988. The remainder of the decline is attributed to the low recruitment of young into the population from 1971-85. The population is expected to continue to decline until the recruitment of young equals or exceeds the mortality of adults. Computer modeling has predicted that this stabilization should occur in the mid 1990's at around 100 pairs. In 1988, 226 coyotes were removed by the following methods: aerial gunning (56%), calling and shooting (10%), trapping and snares (27%) and denning (7%). An estimated 102 ravens were removed using 105 dozen eggs injected with DRC-1339 and an additional three ravens were shot. Twelve raccoons were taken by the following methods: snare (1), shooting (7), and leg-hold trap (4). Crane nesting success was 76 percent, the highest ever recorded on the refuge since formal crane nesting studies began in 1966. Likewise, predation losses were 18 percent, the lowest recorded since 1966. All of the sandhill cranes left the refuge by 13 September, two days before the annual crane chick counts traditionally begin. Thus, total production, fledging success and chick mortality estimates could not be determined in 1988. However, casual observations in mid to late summer indicate that there were probably high chick mortality late in the season that offset the gains made early in the nesting season. The causes for this mortality is unknown, however, it is felt that much of the die-off was drought related either directly or indirectly.  It is recommended that an additional five years of predator control be conducted. This recommendation will be subjected to a thorough evaluation of the impacts, results, and costs of the three year trial period. To do this the 1985 EA\/Plan will be updated. Concerned citizens will be given ample opportunity to comment on the development of the update.",
