    of approximately 400 raster-formatted data layers. It is available on CD-ROM in
    either EPPL7 format. The data themes cover a wide range of physical and biological
    variables, along with administrative, political, sociodemographic, and transportation
    data. The data collection unit for most of the variables is the 40-acre parcel.
    Files have been subdivided into 100-meter by 100-meter grid cells and spatially
    corrected to provide improved geographic reference. However, this processing step
    does not improve the original 40-acre resolution accuracy. The data set is designed
    for use in regional and statewide planning, not for site-specific decision making.
    MGC100 is effectively the MLMIS100 county data set appended into a statewide coverage.",nt"license_title":
