The temperature is calculated using the Emissivity Normalization Algorithm that separate temperature from emissivity. The incoming solar radiation was calculated using spatial based insolation model developed by Fu and Rich (1999). Then the temperature due to solar radiation was calculated using emissivity derived from ASTER data. The residual temperature, i.e. temperature due to solar radiation subtracted from ASTER temperature was used to identify thermally anomalous areas. Areas that had temperature greater than 2u03c3 were considered ASTER modeled u201cvery warm modeled surface temperatureu201d are shown in red on the map.  Areas that had temperatures between 1u03c3 and 2u03c3 were considered ASTER modeled u201cwarm modeled surface temperatureu201d are shown in yellow on the map. nnThis map also includes the locations of shallow temperature survey points, locations of springs or wells with favorable geochemistry, faults, transmission lines, and areas of modeled basement weakness u201cfairwaysu201d.nnnContact Information: nContact Organization: nEarth Science &Observation Center (ESOC), CIRES, University of Colorado at Boulder nContact Person:  Khalid Hussein nAddress: nCIRES, Ekeley Building nEarth Science & Observation Center (ESOC) n216 UCB nCity:  Boulder  State:  CO  Postal Code:  80309-0216  Country:  USA nContact Telephone:  303-492-6782 nSpatial Reference Information: nCoordinate System:  Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) WGSu20191984 Zone 13N nFalse Easting:  500000.00000000 nFalse Northing:  0.00000000 nCentral Meridian:  -105.00000000 nScale Factor:  0.99960000 nLatitude of Origin:  0.00000000 nLinear Unit:  Meter nDatum:  World Geodetic System u20191984 (WGS u20191984) nPrime Meridian:  Greenwich nAngular Unit:  Degree nDigital Form: nFormat Name: PDFn",
