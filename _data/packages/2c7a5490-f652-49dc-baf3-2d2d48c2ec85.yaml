  in Region 2 . This dataset was derived from 2000 census data and based on the criteria
  setforth in the Region 2 Interim Environmental Justice Policy. The two criteria
  for Region 2's EJ demographic analysis are percent poverty and percent minority.
  The percent minority and percent poverty numbers for each blockgroup are compared
  to the benchmark value for the state. Census blockgroups with percent poverty or
  percent minority higher than the state threshold are considered potential EJ areas.
  The cutoffs for each state were derived by using the statistical method - cluster
  analysis. Cluster analysis was chosen as the most objective way of evaluating the
  demographic data and determining cutoff values for minority and low income. With
  cluster analysis, data are divided into two distinct groups (e.g., minority and
  non-minority, and low income and non-low income). Cluster analysis examines natural
  breaks of the data. Separate analyses were conducted for minority and low income,
  respectively, for each State. All census block groups within a State were ranked
  in descending order according to the demographic factor under evaluation. This resulted
  in a ranking for percent minority by block group and a separate ranking for percent
  low income by block group. An iterative process was employed where the data were
  (1) split into two groups; (2) the means for each of the two groups were calculated;
  (3) the difference between the means for each group was determined; and (4) Steps
  1- 3 were repeated until the greatest difference between the means was found. This
  method results in dividing the data into two groups that are as different as possible.
  All of the statistical methods evaluated indicated that minority populations in
  urban areas were skewing the results for the states of New York and New Jersey.
  Specifically, state-wide benchmarks were similar to those derived from using only
  urban areas, while the results for only rural areas were considerably lowered. Consequently,
  minority data was evaluated separately for urban and rural areas within these states.
  These separate analyses yield one statistical reference for the urban and one for
  rural for percent minority for New York and New Jersey. Due to the special situation
  in Puerto Rico and Virgin Island, only percent below poverty is applied for evaluation
  of potential EJ community. Cutoffs for % minority New York Urban 51.51 New York
  Rural 34.73 New Jersey Urban 48.52 New Jersey Rural 29.39 Cutoffs for % below poverty
