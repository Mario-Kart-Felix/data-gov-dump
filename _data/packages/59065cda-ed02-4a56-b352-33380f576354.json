	"notes": "In Phase I project, by leveraging on Agiltron's experience in optical fiber components and our unique fabrication procedure of fiber array, we successfully designed and fabricated the samples of the gradient index fiber (GIF) lens arrays and single mode (SM) fiber arrays for composing a coherent single-mode fiber (SMF) spatial filter array (SFA), which demonstrated the promising results to meet NASA's requirements for the applications in planet exploration. This novel GIF and SMF array based SFA has several advantages over the current approach in small aberration, low insertion loss, high uniformity, high robust and stability.  rnrnIn Phase II, Agiltron will further improve and optimize the fabrication procedure to make the prototype of GIF and SMF array based SFA for NASA applications. This SFA prototype will have more than 1000 effective fiber counts in the requested aperture. Furthermore, the improvements of precision fabrication procedure developed in Phase I will assure that center-to-center deviation in GIF and SMF arrays' deviation is less than +/-0.2?m. At the end of the Phase II, the novel SFA prototype will be provided with fully function integration and environmental test to insert into the experiment system of NASA for further comprehensive evaluation.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
