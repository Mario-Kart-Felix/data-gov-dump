	"notes": "MATECH GSM (MG) proposes 1) to demonstrate a low-cost innovative Hi-TempnSi-doped in-situ BN fiber coating process for advanced ceramic matrixncomposites in order to eliminate performance barriers that preventnpractical use of advanced future NASA aircraft by performing interfacialncoating on single fiber tows and fiber preforms that are applicable tonthe shape and structural requirements of advanced SiC/SiC super- andnhyper-sonic components, and 2) to examine and model environmentalndurability of the fiber coating constituent in various hot-section CMCncomponents.  The CVI coating process is costly and yields a porousnnon-uniform BN structure due to the low temperatures needed forndiffusion and infiltration of the gaseous precursors. MG has discoveredna faster, more economical and more versatile process for fiber interfacencoating formation, reactive-transformation-process (RTP), where theninterface coating is formed from the ceramic fiber itself, a newninnovative in-situ Si-doped BN-based fiber coating that is more stablenduring fabrication and service of Si-based CMC. The formation of annin-situ BN surface layer creates a more environmentally durable fibernsurface not only because a more oxidation-resistant BN is formed, butnalso because this layer provides a physical barrier between contactingnall single fibers with oxidation-prone SiC surface layers.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
