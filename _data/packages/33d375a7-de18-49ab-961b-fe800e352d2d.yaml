  a variety of processes that operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Understanding
  the hierarchical nature of these processes will aid in prioritization of restoration
  efforts. This hierarchical Columbia River Estuary Ecosystem Classification (henceforth
  \"Classification\") of the Columbia River estuary is a spatial database of the tidally-influenced
  reaches of the lower Columbia River, the tidally affected parts of its tributaries,
  and the landforms that make up their floodplains for the 230 kilometers between
  the Pacific Ocean and Bonneville Dam. This work is a collaborative effort between
  University of Washington School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences (henceforth \"UW\"),
  U.S. Geological Survey (henceforth \"USGS\"), and the Lower Columbia Estuary Partnership
  (henceforth \"EP\"). Consideration of geomorphologic processes will improve the
  understanding of controlling physical factors that drive ecosystem evolution along
  the tidal Columbia River. The Classification is organized around six hierarchical
  levels, progressing from the coarsest, regional scale to the finest, localized scale:
  (1) Ecosystem Province; (2) Ecoregion; (3) Hydrogeomorphic Reach; (4) Ecosystem
  Complex; (5) Geomorphic Catena; and (6) Primary Cover Class. For Levels 4 and 5,
  we mapped landforms within the Holocene floodplain primarily by visual interpretation
  of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) topography supplemented with aerial photographs,
  Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soils data, and historical maps. Mapped
  landforms are classified as to their current geomorphic function, the inferred process
  regime that formed them, and anthropogenic modification. Channels were classified
  primarily by a set of depth-based rules and geometric relationships. Classification
  Level 5 floodplain landforms (\"geomorphic catenae\") were further classified based
  on multivariate analysis of land-cover within the mapped landform area and attributed
  as \"sub-catena\". The extent of detailed mapping is the interpreted Holocene geologic
  floodplain of the tidal Columbia River and its tributaries to the estimated head
  of tide. The extent of this dataset also includes tributary valleys that are not
  mapped in detail. The upstream extents of tributary valleys are an estimation of
  the limit of Columbia River influence and are for use as containers in future analyses.
  The geologic floodplain is the geomorphic surface that is actively accumulating
  sediment through occasional overbank deposition. Most features within the geologic
  floodplain are considered to be formed during the recent (Holocene-epoch) climatic
  regime. There are bedrock and pre-Holocene sedimentary deposits included where they
  are surrounded by Holocene sediment accumulations or have been shaped by Holocene
  floods. In some places, Holocene landforms such as landslides, tributary fans, and
  coastal dunes are mapped that extend outside of the modern floodplain. This map
  is not a floodplain hazard map or delineation of actual flood boundaries. Although
  wetlands are included in the Classification, they are based on different criteria
  than jurisdictional wetlands. The extent of mapping may differ from the actual limit
  of tidal influence.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\":
