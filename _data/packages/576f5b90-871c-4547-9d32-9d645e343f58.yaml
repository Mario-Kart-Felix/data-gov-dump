  false,\n\t\"url\": null,\n\t\"notes\": \"An earthquake is the motion or trembling
  of the ground produced by sudden displacement of rock in the Earth's crust. Earthquakes
  result from crustal strain, volcanism, landslides, and collapse of caverns. Earthquakes
  can affect hundreds of thousands of square kilometers; cause damage to property
  measured in the tens of billions of dollars; result in loss of life and injury to
  hundreds of thousands of persons; and disrupt the social and economic functioning
  of the affected area. This set of slides provides an overview and summary of effects
  caused by 11 earthquakes in eight countries. The images show surface faulting, landslides,
  soil liquefaction, and structural damage.Stress accumulates in response to tectonic
  forces until it exceeds the strength of the rock. The rock then breaks along a preexisting
  or new fracture called a fault. The rupture extends outward in all directions along
  the fault plane from its point of origin (focus). The rupture travels in an irregular
  manner until the stress is relatively equalized. If the rupture disturbs the surface,
  it produces a visible fault. Earthquakes can affect hundreds of thousands of square
  kilometers; cause damage to property measured in the tens of billions of dollars;
  result in loss of life and injury to hundreds of thousands of persons; and disrupt
  the social and economic functioning of the affected area. Although earthquakes in
  the United States occur most frequently in states west of the Rocky Mountains, devastating
  earthquakes have also occurred in the Midwest and East. All 50 states have some
  degree of risk from earthquakes. Earthquakes can be measured in terms of either
  the amount of energy they release (magnitude) or the degree of ground shaking they
  cause at a particular locality (intensity). Magnitude is calculated from the record
  (wave amplitude) made by an earthquake on a calibrated seismograph. The magnitude
  scale is logarithmic. An increase of one in magnitude represents a tenfold increase
  in the recorded wave amplitude. However, the energy release associated with an increase
  of one in magnitude is not tenfold, but about thirty fold. For example, approximately
  900 times more energy is released in an earthquake of magnitude 7 than in an earthquake
  of magnitude 5. Intensity is determined from observations of the earthquake's effect
  on people, structures, and the earth's surface at a given locality. When a fault
  ruptures, seismic waves propagate outward in all directions and ground shaking results.
  Generally the severity of ground shaking increases as magnitude increases and decreases
  as distance from the fault rupture increases. The severity of the ground shaking
  can be enhanced by certain soil and subsoil types. The intensity of the earthquake
  is affected by the severity of the ground shaking, the duration of the shaking,
  the response of structures in the affected area, etc. Hazards associated with earthquakes
  include ground shaking, surface faulting, earthquake-induced ground failures, tectonic
  uplift and subsidence, and tsunamis. Surface faulting, the offset of the earth's
  surface by differential movement across a fault, shears and tears structures built
  on the fault. Surface faulting is generally accompanied by horizontal or vertical
  distortion of the earth's surface that can distort or tilt structures constructed
  near the fault. Regional uplift and subsidence may accompany earthquakes caused
  by large displacements on shallow faults. Such changes can damage harbor facilities,
  canals, roads, railroads, and other structures. A tsunami is a water wave or a series
  of waves generated by an impulsive vertical displacement of the surface of the ocean
  or other body of water by an earthquake or other cause. These waves can extend the
  damaging effects of an earthquake event thousands of kilometers from the earthquake
  focus. Ground failures accompanying earthquakes include landslides, liquefaction,
  lateral spreads, differential settlements, and ground cracks. Earthquake shaking
  often dislodges rock and debris on steep slopes, triggering rock falls, avalanches,
  and landslides. These slides have been known to bury entire towns and may be the
  most damaging aspect of the earthquake event. Liquefaction occurs where ground water
  is near the surface in soils composed of sands and silts. The soil temporarily loses
  strength and behaves as a viscous liquid. Structures can settle or tip in the liquefied
  soil or be ripped apart as the ground spreads laterally or flows. Flow failures
  can move over kilometers at speeds of tens of kilometers per hour. They usually
  develop in loose, saturated sand on slopes greater than five percent. When subsurface
  sand layers lose strength because of liquefaction, lateral spreading can occur in
  overlying sediments allowing them to move down even the gentlest slopes. Soils may
  lose shear strength allowing heavy structures to settle or tip and lightweight,
  buried structures to rise buoyantly. Cracking may result from movement along faults,
  differential compaction of the soil, or slides. Strong ground shaking has compacted
  loose cohesionless materials and caused differential ground settlements ranging
  from 5 cm to more than a meter. Many of these earthquake effects are depicted in
  the slides included in this set.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\":
