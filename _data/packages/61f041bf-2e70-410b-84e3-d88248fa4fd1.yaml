  & Ranging) 3x3 meter resolution relative seafloor reflectivity surface for an area
  including and surrounding Buck Island Reef National Monument (BUIS), St. Croix in
  the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). The image's horizontal coordinate system is NAD83
  UTM 20 North. Fugro LADS, in collaboration with NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography
  Branch, the University of New Hampshire and the National Park Service, acquired
  bathymetry, relative seafloor reflectivity and hyperspectral imagery in St. Croix
  from 2/21 to 2/22/2011. Hyperspectral data were acquired using a Hyspex VNIR-1600
  sensor. Bathymetry and reflectivity data were acquired using a LADS (Laser Airborne
  Depth Sounder) Mark II Airborne System from altitudes between 1,200 and 2,200ft
  at ground speeds between 140 and 175 knots. The 900 Hertz Nd: YAG (neodymium-doped
  yttrium aluminum garnet) laser (1064 nm) acquired 3x3 meter spot spacing and 200%
  seabed coverage. In total, 32.2 square kilometers of LiDAR relectivity were collected
  between 0 m and 49 m in depth. Environmental factors such as wind strength and direction,
  cloud cover, water clarity and depth influenced the area of data acquisition on
  a daily basis. The data was processed using the LADS Mark II Ground System and data
  visualization, quality control and final products were created using CARIS HIPS
  and SIPS and CARIS BASE Editor. All users should individually evaluate the suitability
  of this data according to their own needs and standards.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819\",\n\t\"extras\":
