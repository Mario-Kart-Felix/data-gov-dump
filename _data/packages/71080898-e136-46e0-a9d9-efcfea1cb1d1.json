	"notes": "This 2010 NASA SBIR Phase 1 proposal for an innovative Low-Field Vector Magnetometer (V-400-LF) is a response to subtopic S1.06 Particles and Field Sensors and Instrument Enabling Technologies. The V-400-LF instrument is intended for making high-resolution magnetic field measurements of planets and in interplanetary space on small satellites and spacecraft. The Phase 1 effort includes development of designs for advanced miniaturized components and a conceptual design for a miniaturized V-400-LF instrument in order to establish the feasibility of designing and fabricating a prototype V 400-LF in Phase 2. Laser-pumped helium magnetometers have proven to be world-class instruments for measuring the direction and magnitude of the geomagnetic and planetary fields. The V-400-LF will build on the heritage of the Low-field Vector Helium Magnetometer (LVHM), the Scalar Helium Magnetometer (SHM), and the laser-pumped vector/scalar Self-calibrating Vector Helium Magnetometer (SVHM). The goal of Phase 1 is development of a conceptual design for a miniaturized instrument appropriate for small spacecraft and microsatellites. This miniaturization will be accomplished through the use of advanced miniaturized components and packaging methods for the V-400-LF Sensor and Electronics. The V-400-LF can be used to measure vector components of low magnetic fields, scalar gradients (difference of vector magnitude measurements from two V-400-LF instruments), and gradient tensor elements (difference between vector components using three or more instruments) with very high stability and accuracy. The V-400-LF will have a dynamic range of +/- 1,000 nT, a sensitivity of 10 pT/rtHz at 1 Hz, and a calibrated accuracy of +/- 0.5 nT. The sample rate will be 430 Hz. The TRL is expected to be 4 at the end of the Phase 1 contract.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
