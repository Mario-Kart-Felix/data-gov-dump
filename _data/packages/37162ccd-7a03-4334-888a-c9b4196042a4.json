The photos are being interpreted using a 1-hectare 10% minimum vegetation cover to delineate land cover/land use, percent vegetation cover, tree height, and hydrology regime. The geographic extent of the UMRS is the Mississippi River from Cairo, IL to Minneapolis, MN and the Illinois River from its confluence with the Mississippi near Grafton, IL to Lake Michigan.",
