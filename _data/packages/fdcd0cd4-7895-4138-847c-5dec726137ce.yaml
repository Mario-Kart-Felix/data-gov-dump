    maps derived from the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)-Polar
    Orbiting Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) have been available since
    1981. The multichannel sea surface temperature algorithm (MCSST) has been used to
    routinely calculate SSTs using a split window approach. Currently this algorithm
    is applied by the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) to calculate SSTs at a
    near real-time rate.    The multichannel sea surface temperature algorithm uses
    a set of linear coefficients to retrive sea surface temperature from the brightness
    radiances. Improved cloud retrieval algorithms applied by NAVOCEANO have significantly
    increased the number of SST pixels flagged as cloud free, as compared to previous
    MCSST data sets. The NAVOCEANO MCSST data sets provide a high quality near real
    time sea surface temperature data set with a high number of cloud free retrievals.
    Additionally the orbital temporal and 9km spatial resolutions allow this data to
    be used in a quasi real time mode for detection of mesoscale features such as eddies
    associated with major current systems. The history of SST computation from AVHRR
    radiances is discussed at length by- -McClain et al., 1985--. Briefly, radiative
    transfer theory is used to correct for the effects of the atmosphere on the observations
    by utilizing "windows" of the electromagnetic spectrum where little or no atmospheric
    absorption occurs. Channel radiances are transformed (through the use of the Planck
    function) to units of temperature, then compared to a-priori temperatures measured
    at the surface. This comparison yields coefficients which, when applied to the global
    AVHRR data, give estimates of surface temperature which have been nominally accurate
    to 0.7 degrees Celsius. Each AVHRR scan views Earth for 51.282 milliseconds, during
    which time each channel of the analog data output is digitized. Scans occur at the
    rate of 6 per second, and the sampling rate of the AVHRR sensors is 39,936 samples
    per second per channel. During a scan, the detectors view an internal target, cold
    space, and the external scene. The temperature of the internal target is monitored,
    and space is assumed to have a black- body temperature of 3K. In this way, a simple
    two-point linear calibration is done internally (Schwalb, 1978). The nonlinear modification
    to this calibration is achieved at the time of postprocessing, and takes into account
    sensor nonlinearities, measurement of internal target temperature, calculation of
    target radiance, internal reflections and emissions, etc.  Sensor/Instrument Measurement
    Geometry:The AVHRR has a cross-track scanning system which use an elliptical beryllium
    mirror rotating at 360 RPM about an axis parallel to the Earth. The 110.8 degree
    cross-track scan equates to a swath width of about 2700 km. This swath width is
    greater than the 25.3 degree separation between successive orbital tracks, and provides
    overlapping coverage. Coverage is global, twice daily, at an instantaneous field
    of view (IFOV) of ~1.4 milliradians, giving a ground field of view of ~1.1 km at
    nadir for a nominal altitude of 833 km. Full resolution AVHRR data are continuously
    transmitted and recorded in High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) format.
    The Global Area Coverage (GAC) data are subsampled to approximately 4 km IFOV, recorded
    internally, and downlinked daily. The MCSST coefficients are then applied to the
    infrared brightness radiances to convert to SST. A level 2 declouded product produced
    by the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) is then downloaded to JPL for distribution.
    nGranularity: (http://harp.gsfc.nasa.gov:1729/eosdis_documents/glossary.of.terms.html#GRANULE)
    The level 2 product is separated into orbital files with each file consisting of
    an ascending (daytime) and descending (nighttime) pass. Data are available from
    both the NOAA-14 and NOAA-16 satellites.  Data Format: The data and information

    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
