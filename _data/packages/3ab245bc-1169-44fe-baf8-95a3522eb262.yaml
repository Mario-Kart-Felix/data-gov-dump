    This Geographic Information System dataset may be described as the 2004 LIDAR-based
    Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for Benton and Washington Counties in Arkansas. Vertical
    units are in Feet. This raster (25ft resolution) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was
    generated using a bare earth point cloud obtained from Landair Mapping, Inc as part
    of the August 2004 LIDAR acquisition (Washington & Benton Counties, AR) coordinated
    by John McLarty, Elizabeth Bowen, Brian Culpepper, and Dr. Jack Cothren of the Northwest
    Arkansas Imagery Task Force. This collaborative project was made possible due the
    financial support provided by the numerous State, Federal, local government, and
    private sector entities who actively participated in the Northwest Arkansas Imagery
    Task Force meetings hosted by the NWARPC during 2004. Users of these data owe a
    special thanks to John McLarty (NWARPC) and Elizabeth Bowen (Benton County GIS Coordinator)
    for their superior leadership during this effort. Funding to support the distribution
    of this data via Arkansas' GeoStor was made possible by Mullins Library at the University
