	"notes": "The goal of the Phase I effort is to design, develop and demonstrate a novel solid-state ceramic-based voltage isolator and demonstrate its potential to provide a highly radiation tolerant digital voltage isolation solution applicable to a wide range of NASA mission requirements.  The related design success QorTek has will lead to development in Phase I of a completely new gate drive technology with many advantages and benefits to the entire spectrum of NASA and commercial applications.  The Phase I design goals are focused primarily on early COMSOL Multiphysics based Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the proposed ceramic device, as well as electrical circuit design and SPICE modeling of a high-side MOSFET gate driver system incorporating the new ceramic isolator.  This preliminary development early in the program will enable the main objective of Phase I which is to fabricate initial isolator ceramic-based gate driver prototypes and undertake basic electrical test characterization of their performance.   An all-inclusive electrical design targeted to isolated MOSFET gate driver applications will also be developed as a functional demonstration platform prototype. The purpose of the Phase I prototypes is to demonstrate, through hardware functional testing and device characterization, that the ceramic gate driver technology provides a feasible size and performance equivalent replacement for similar COTS non-rad hard isolation solutions.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
