    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "NASA's future X-ray astronomy missions will
    require X-ray optics that have large effective areas, are lightweight, and cost
    effective.  Recent X-ray telescopes, such as the Chandra Observatory, utilized reflectors
    made from zerodur which were up to 20mm thick.  The thickness of these reflectors,
    as well as the mass, limited the number of nested optics that could be implemented.
     Current state of the art telescopes, such as those found on XMM-Newton, utilize
    reflectors made from an electroforming process with shell thicknesses on the order
    of 1mm.  This reduction in thickness has enabled a larger number of reflectors to
    be implemented, 58 nested reflectors in the case of XMM-Newton, but the weight still
    needs to be significantly reduced for future missions.  The proposed innovation
    seeks to improve upon the current state of the art by replacing much of the NiCo
    with a stiff, lightweight, ceramic material.  A thermal spray process, which was
    tested for feasibility in Phase I, will be enhanced to allow for the deposition
    of porosity graded alumina onto the rear surface of the NiCo reflector. Several
    diagnostic techniques will be employed to adjust the in-flight particle state as
    well as the residual stress of the coating as to not adversely affect the micro
    roughness of the optical surface as well as the figure accuracy of the optic. The
    gradation of the alumina layer will allow for CTE matching with the electroformed
    shell as well as optimization of the ceramic stiffness.  By reducing the NiCo layer
    from 1mm to less than 100um with a 200um alumina layer as the support structure
    the overall mass of the telescope can be greatly reduced allowing for a greater
    number of reflectors to be nested.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
