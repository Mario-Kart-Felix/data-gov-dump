    (.txt format). Three files contain productivity data for a mixed prairie at the
    Matador Field Station, Canada, and two files contain climate data. The 8-km2 Matador
    Field Station (50.70 N, -107.72 W, Elevation 676 m) is located approximately 47-km
    north of the city of Swift Current in southern Saskatchewan Province at the northern
    limit of the "mixed prairie" portion of the North American Great Plains. The study
    area is located on the bed of a former glacial lake. One NPP file contains monthly
    measurements of above-ground standing live and dead biomass and litter made in "Section
    16" by harvest methods during the growing season from March or April 1968 to October
    or November 1972. The second NPP file contains monthly measurements of root biomass
    made at different depths in "Section 16" during the growing season from April
    1968 to July 1971. The third NPP file contains monthly above-ground biomass estimates
    for a secondary study area during the growing season from May 1970 to August 1972.
    The climate data are reported from two locations, one file from a weather station
    at Swift Current (1938-1990) and the other from a weather station at the Field Station
    during the study period (1968-1972). The above- and below-ground net primary productivity
    (ANPP and BNPP, respectively) were calculated for "Section 16" only. ANPP (363
    g/m2/yr) was sum of the increase in green biomass over the growing season, plus
    increase in dead biomass and litter. BNPP (600 g/m2/yr) was the increase in root
    biomass over the growing season.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
