	"notes": "A method has been developed for prognostication of accrued prior damage in electronics subjected to overlapping sequential environments of thermal aging and thermal cycling. The presented approach uses the LM Algorithm in conjunction with microstructural evolution of damage based leading indi- cator for estimating prior stress history. Specific damage proxies examined include the phase-growth indicator and the IMC thickness. The viability of the approach has been demonstrated for leadfree test assemblies subjected to thermal aging at 125 u00b0C and redeployed in cyclic thermo-mechanical environment u221255u2013125 u00b0C. Damage equivalency relationships between thermal aging during storage life and the resulting reduction in thermo-mechanical reliability in cyclic thermal environments during field deployment has been derived and validated based on two damage proxies. Convergence of the damage mapping to a common solution from data based on the two separate leading indicators has been demonstrated. Assemblies subjected to sequential stresses have been prog- nosticated for accrued damage from sequential overlapping stresses of thermal aging and thermal cycling. Correlation between the prognosticated damage and the actual accrued damage demonstrates that the proposed approach can be used to assess damage accrued under overlapping thermo- mechanical stresses of thermal aging and thermal cycling. In addition, prognostics metrics have been used to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the prognostic algorithms using both the leading indicators. Results demonstrate that both damage proxies work well in estimating accrued damage and estimating residual life.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
