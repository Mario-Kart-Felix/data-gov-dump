	"notes": "Planned future NASA missions in astrophysics will push the state of the art in current opto-mechanical technologies. Specifically, precision deployable structures will be required to facilitate large aperture deployable optical telescopes given current and foreseeable payload volumes. Fundamental to these deployable structures are enabling components that are capable of precise, repeatable deployments and that are stable in the orbital environment.rnMMA Design LLC proposes to advance the state of the art in highly reliable and cost effective deployable optical systems by developing precision mobile-joint and latching technologies that are integral to a deployable optical telescope. This proposal focuses on research and development of innovative precision deployment technologies that initially target a 6U CubeSat to ESPA-class optical platform but that are highly scalable to 16 meter class or larger optical systems.rnThe primary innovations in the development of the proposed precision deployable technologies include:rn?tScalable System Design &amp;#150; The deployable system and components can be proportionally scaled to accommodate larger aperture systems.rn?tRepeatable Multiple Degree-of-Freedom Joints &amp;#150; Use of flexible elements and preloading of movable parts enables deployment repeatability and precision.rn?tHigh Performance at lower cost &amp;#150; The proposed approach utilizes innovative concepts for latching and joint mobility that will yield significant improvements in performance at lower system cost.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
