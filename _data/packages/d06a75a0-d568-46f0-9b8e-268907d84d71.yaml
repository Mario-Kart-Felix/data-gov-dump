  an Alzheimer patient that forgets sometimes to complete the activities that he begins.
  The key point to assist the smart home resident is to model the activities and discover
  correct realization patterns of activities. To accomplish this task, we apply sensors
  to provide primary data about realization patterns of actions, operations, plans,
  goals and generally any objective that the smart home resident may desire to do.
  In the consequence, by applying fuzzy clustering techniques, we are able to mine
  sensor data to retrieve the realization patterns of activities, and so the prediction
  patterns of intentions are recognizable. Comparing the realization patterns with
  prediction patterns of activities, we would be able to predict the intention of
  the resident about the activity that the resident considers to realize. In this
  way, we would be able to provide hypotheses about the resident goals and his possible
  goal achievementu2019s defects. Spatiotemporal aspects of daily activities such
  as movement of objects are surveyed to discover the patterns of activities realized
  by the smart homes residents. In this research, uncertainty is considered as a property
  of activity recognition.rn\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S. Government Work\",\n\t\"extras\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
