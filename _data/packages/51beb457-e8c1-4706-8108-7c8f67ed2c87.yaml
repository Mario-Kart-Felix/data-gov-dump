    Zone Color Scanner Experiment (CZCS) was the first instrument devoted to the measurement
    of ocean color and flown on a spacecraft. Although other instruments flown on other
    spacecraft had sensed ocean color, their spectral bands, spatial resolution and
    dynamic range were optimized for land or meteorological use and had limited sensitivity
    in this area, whereas in CZCS, every parameter was optimized for use over water
    to the exclusion of any other type of sensing. CZCS had six spectral bands, four
    of which were used primarily for ocean color. These were of a 20 nanometer bandwidth
    centered at 443, 520, 550, and 670 nm. Band 5 had a 100 nm bandwidth centered at
    750 nm and a dynamic range more suited to land. Band 6 operated in the 10.5 to 12.5
    micrometer region and sensed emitted thermal radiance for derivation of equivalent
    black body temperature. (This thermal band failed within the first year of the mission,
    and so was not used in the global processing effort.) Bands 1-4 were preset to view
    water only and saturated when the IFOV was over most types of land surfaces, or
    clouds.n        n        The most important objective of the Coastal Zone Color
    Scanner mission was to determine if satellite remote sensing of color could be used
    to identify and quantify material suspended or dissolved in ocean waters. Specifically
    CZCS attempted to discriminate between organic and inorganic materials in the water,
    determine the quantity of material and discriminate between different organic particulate
    types.n        n        This product contains composite eight day Level-3 binned
    (Equal-Area Sinusoidal grid) data products in three variants:n            CHL- which
    includes chlorophyll a,n            KD490 - which includes diffuse attenuation at
    490nm andn            RRS which includes the remote sensing reflectance in the visible
    bands, aerosol optical depth at 670nm and aerosol angstrom parameter.n    ",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
