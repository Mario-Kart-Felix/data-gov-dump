  dataset uploaded in support of Low Temperature Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis
  for the Appalachian Basin (GPFA-AB, DOE Project DE-EE0006726). Phase 1 of the GPFA-AB
  project identified potential Geothermal Play Fairways within the Appalachian basin
  of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and New York.  This was accomplished through analysis
  of 4 key criteria or u2018risksu2019: thermal quality, natural reservoir productivity,
  risk of seismicity, and heat utilization.  Each of these analyses represent a distinct
  project task, with the fifth task encompassing combination of the 4 risks factors.
  \ Supporting data for all five tasks has been uploaded into the Geothermal Data
  Repository node of the National Geothermal Data System (NGDS). nnThis submission
  comprises the data for Thermal Quality Analysis (project task 1) and includes all
  of the necessary shapefiles, rasters, datasets, code, and references to code repositories
  that were used to create the thermal resource and risk factor maps as part of the
  GPFA-AB project. The identified Geothermal Play Fairways are also provided with
  the larger dataset. Figures (.png) are provided as examples of the shapefiles and
  rasters. The regional standardized 1 square km grid used in the project is also
  provided as points (cell centers), polygons, and as a raster. Two ArcGIS toolboxes
  are available: 1) RegionalGridModels.tbx for creating resource and risk factor maps
  on the standardized grid, and 2) ThermalRiskFactorModels.tbx for use in making the
  thermal resource maps and cross sections. These toolboxes contain u201citem descriptionu201d
  documentation for each model within the toolbox, and for the toolbox itself. This
  submission also contains three R scripts: 1) AddNewSeisFields.R to add seismic risk
  data to attribute tables of seismic risk, 2) StratifiedKrigingInterpolation.R for
  the interpolations used in the thermal resource analysis, and 3) LeaveOneOutCrossValidation.R
  for the cross validations used in the thermal interpolations.nnSome file descriptions
  make reference to various 'memos'.  These are contained within the final report
  submitted October 16, 2015.   nnEach zipped file in the submission contains an 'about'
  document describing the full Thermal Quality Analysis content available, along with
  key sources, authors, citation, use guidelines, and assumptions, with the specific
  file(s) contained within the .zip file  highlighted.\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"Creative
