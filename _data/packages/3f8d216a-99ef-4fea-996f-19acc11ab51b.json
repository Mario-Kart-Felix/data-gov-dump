	"notes": "Deployable Space Systems, Inc. (DSS) will focus the proposed NASA Phase 2 effort on the development and TRL 5/6 maturation of our innovative Functional Advanced Concentrator Technology (FACT) for standard multi-junction and advanced IMM photovoltaics.  FACT is a highly-affordable, practical, high-efficiency, ultra-lightweight photovoltaic concentrator blanket assembly that can be rolled or z-folded in a stowed configuration.  FACT coupled to an ultra-lightweight solar array structural platform will provide game-changing performance metrics and unparalleled affordability.  FACT will enable emerging SEP Space Science and Exploration missions through its ultra-affordability, ultra-lightweight, ultra-compact stowage volume, and practical/user-friendly off-pointing versus power characteristics.  The FACT technology promises to provide NASA/industry a near-term and low-risk flexible blanket technology for advanced solar array systems.  The FACT technology provides revolutionary performance in terms of:  High specific power (&gt;260W/kg BOL with ZTJ/XTJ and ~400W/kg BOL with IMM PV when coupled to ROSA-array); Affordability (&gt;40&#37; cost savings when coupled to ROSA-array);  Flexible blanket compatibility / architecture flexibility (accommodates rolled or z-folded blankets);  User-friendly off-pointing versus power characteristics;  Compact stowage volume (&gt;50kW/m3); High deployment reliability; High radiation tolerance and high voltage operation capability;  Applicability/scalability to many missions (500W-1MW+ sizes);  LILT/HIHT operation capability; and Adaptable to standard rigid honeycomb panel arrays.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
