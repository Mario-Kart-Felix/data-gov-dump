  the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Main Galaxy Sample, The Galaxy Evolution Explorer All
  Sky Survey, and The Two Micron All Sky Survey using two new training-set methods.
  \ We utilize the broad-band photometry from the three surveys alongside Sloan Digital
  Sky Survey measures of photometric quality and galaxy morphology. Our first training-set
  method draws from the theory of ensemble learning while the second employs Gaussian
  process regression both of which allow for the estimation of redshift along with
  a measure of uncertainty in the estimation. The Gaussian process models the data
  very effectively with small training samples of approximately 1000 points or less.
  These two methods are compared to a well known Artificial Neural Network training-set
  method and to simple linear and quadratic regression. We also demonstrate the need
  to provide confidence bands on the error estimation made by both classes of models.
  \ Our results indicate that variations due to the optimization procedure used for
  almost all neural networks, combined with the variations due to the data sample,
  can produce models with variations in accuracy that span an order of magnitude.
  A key contribution of this paper is to quantify the variability in the quality of
  results as a function of model and training sample.  We show how simply choosing
  the ``best\" model given a data set and model class can produce misleading results.
  \ We also investigate supplemental information provided by the Sloan Digital Sky
  Survey photometric pipeline related to photometric quality and galaxy morphology
  tracers. We show that, using these additional quality and morphology indicators
  rather than only the Sloan Digital Sky Survey broad-band u,g,r,i,z imaging data
  commonly used, one can improve redshift accuracy by 10s of percent. Near Infrared
  LaTeX  broad-band photometry provided from the Two Micron All Sky Survey and near-ultraviolet
  and far-ultraviolet broad-band data from The Galaxy Evolution Explorer All Sky Survey
  are also investigated where they overlap with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our
  results show that robust photometric redshift errors as low as 0.02 RMS can regularly
  be obtained. We believe these can be expanded to other photometric surveys where
  sufficient redshift calibration objects exist.\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S. Government

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
