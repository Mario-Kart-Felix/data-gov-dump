	"notes": "We measured standard water quality parameters and collected water, sediment, and biota samples from Stone Lakes National Wildlife Refuge and adjacent areas during March, April, and May, 1997. Water samples were analyzed for trace elements and heavy metals; sediment and biota samples were analyzed for trace elements, heavy metals, organochlorine pesticides, and PCB congeners. Water quality was good in Black-crown Lake, Lower Beach Lake, and the North arm of North Stone Lake. Water quality in Morrison Creek, South Stone Lake, and the South arm of North Stone Lake was somewhat impaired by elevated temperatures, elevated conductivity, or low dissolved oxygen. Lead concentrations in water were elevated at Black-crown Lake, Morrison Creek, and Lower Beach Lake. Lead concentrations in biota exceeded the threshold for adverse effects at Blackcrown Lake and Lower Beach Lake. Copper concentrations were also elevated in water from Black-crown Lake. Selenium concentrations in water were slightly elevated at Black-crown Lake and Lower Beach Lake. There were numerous guideline exceedences for heavy metals in sediments from all sites. Concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc were elevated in sediment from one or more sites. Organochlorine pesticide and PCB concentrations were low in sediment samples from all sites. Concentrations of trace elements and heavy metals were low in fish fillets and waterbird eggs. Chromium concentrations in bullfrog tadpoles, inland silversides, mosquitofish, and white crappie were elevated. Copper concentrations detected in crayfish and bullfrog tadpoles were similar to concentrations linked to polluted waters. Concentrations of organochlorine pesticides and PCBs in all biota were below levels that would cause adverse effects. Morrison Creek and Lower Beach Lake were the most polluted waterbodies of those we studied, and should be monitored in the future. In addition, to maintain water quality that is consistent with the goal of the refuge, we suggest the initiation of a long-term monitoring program to track any changes in contaminant concentrations resulting from current and future land-use patterns around the refuge.",
