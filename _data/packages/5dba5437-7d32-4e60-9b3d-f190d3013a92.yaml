    program (MSCP) was developed for the conservation of plants and animals in the southeast
    portion of San Diego County. Monitoring of species found within the MSCP is a key
    method to measuring the success of the reserve system. The Coastal Cactus Wren is
    one of the focal species identified as part of the MSCP Biological Monitoring Plan.
    The species is also currently on the State of California Birds of Species Concern
    list. The primary threat to the cactus wren is habitat loss and concurrent fragmentation,
    which occurs as habitat is developed or fire destroys cactus. The coastal cactus
    wren historically occurred in cactus patches along the several lagoons and coastal
    canyons in San Diego and southern Orange County (Rea and Weaver 1990), though recent
    surveys reveal that most of these populations have been destroyed by urbanization
    (Rea and Weaver 1990, USFWS 1994). The remaining coastal cactus wren populations
    in San Diego County are predominantly in the inland portion of the county (Rea and
    Weaver 1990). This datalayer presents the positive observations of USFWS Cactus
    Wren occupancy surveys conducted in San Diego County in 2011 and was compiled as
    part of the Southern California Data Integration Project. Extensive cactus mapping
    was conducted in San Diego County prior to the survey effort. Cactus wren monitoring
    was done within an occupancy framework to determine the percentage of plots occupied
    by cactus wrens, estimated from plot surveys. Surveys were conducted from April
    26-June 7, 2011 between sunrise and sunset. Each plot was visited up to 3 times
    during the survey season. Environmental measurements (air temperature, average wind
    speed) were recorded during a 1-minute period upon arriving at a sample point using
    a pocket weather station. Surveys were not conducted if average wind speeds exceeded
    20 kilometers per hour, precipitation exceeded a drizzle, or ambient temperatures
    were less than 4.5C (40F) or over 30C (85F)",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
