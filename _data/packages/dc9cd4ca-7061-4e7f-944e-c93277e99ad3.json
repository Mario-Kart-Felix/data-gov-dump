	"notes": "GAP species range data show a coarse representation of the total areal extent of a species or the geographic limits within which a species can be found (Morrison and Hall 2002). To represent these geographic limits, GAP compiled existing GAP data, where available, and NatureServe data (Patterson et al. 2003, Ridgely et al. 2007, NatureServe 2010) IUCN data (IUCN 2004), where needed. Data provided by GAP in collaboration with the Northwest Gap Analysis Project (NWGAP), the Southwest Regional Gap Analysis Project (SWReGAP), the Southeast Gap Analysis Project (SEGAP), the Alaska Gap Analysis Project (AKGAP), the Hawaii Gap Analysis Project (HIGAP), the Puerto Rico Gap Analysis Project (PRGAP), and the U.S. Virgin Islands Gap Analysis Project (USVIGAP). Web map services for species ranges can be accessed via: http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Birds http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Mammals http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Amphibians http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Reptiles A table listing all of GAP's available web map services can be found here: http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/species/data/web-map-services/ Bird data provided by NatureServe in collaboration with Robert Ridgely, James Zook, The Nature Conservancy's Migratory Bird Program, Conservation International's Center for Applied Biodiversity Science (CABS), World Wildlife Fund US, and Environment Canada's WILDSPACE. Mammal data provided by NatureServe in collaboration with Bruce Patterson, Wes Sechrest, Marcelo Tognelli, Gerardo Ceballos, The Nature Conservancy's Migratory Bird Program, Conservation International's CABS, World Wildlife Fund US, and Environment Canada's WILDSPACE. Reptile data were provided by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). Amphibian data developed as part of the Global Amphibian Assessment and provided by IUCN-World Conservation Union, Conservation International and NatureServe. Once the needed range data were compiled it was intersected with Natural Resource Conservation Service National Watershed Boundary dataset of 12-digit hydrological units for the US (U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service 2009). Range data were attributed with information regarding occurrence/presence, origin, reproductive use, and seasonal use from GAP regional projects (SWReGAP, SEGAP, NWGAP, AKGAP, HIGAP, PRGAP, and USVIGAP), NatureServe data, and IUCN data. GAP used the best information available to create these species ranges; however GAP seeks to improve and update these data as new information becomes available. These species range data provide the biological context within which to build our species distribution models. Recommended citation: U.S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Program (USGS-GAP). [Year].

It is also strongly recommended that careful attention be paid to the contents of the metadata file associated with these data. The U.S. Geological Survey shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data described and/or contained herein. All information is created with a specific end use or uses in mind. This is especially true for GIS data, which is expensive to produce and must be directed to meet the immediate program needs. However, these data were created with the expectation that they would be used for other applications; therefore, we list below both appropriate and inappropriate uses. This list is in no way exhaustive but should serve as a guide to assess whether a proposed use can or cannot be supported by these data. For many uses, it is unlikely that GAP's species range data will provide the only data needed, and for uses with a regulatory outcome, field surveys should verify the result. In the end, it will be the responsibility of each data user to determine if these data can answer the question being asked, and if they are the best tool to answer that question. While it is impossible to predict all the uses of these data we have listed several possible appropriate and inappropriate uses from GAP's perspective. All data are provided as is without warranty as to its currency, completeness, or accuracy of any specific data. NatureServe hereby disclaims all warranties and conditions with regard to any documents provided with these data, including but not limited to all implied warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. NatureServe makes no representations about the suitability of this data. In no event shall USGS-GAP or NatureServe be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential damages, or for damages of any kind arising out of or in connection with the use or performance of information contained in these data, under any theory of liability used. The data provided are for planning, assessment, and informational purposes. The information provided is not a survey quality dataset. This disclaimer applies both to individual use of the data and aggregate use with other data. Appropriate uses of the data: primarily as a coarse map for a large area such as a county or to provide context for finer-level maps. A general list of possible applications include: -National, regional or statewide biodiversity planning -National, Regional or state habitat conservation planning -County comprehensive planning -Large-area resource management planning -Coarse-filter evaluation of potential impacts or benefits of major projects or plan initiatives on biodiversity, such as utility or transportation corridors, wilderness proposals, habitat connectivity proposals, climate change adaption proposals, regional open space and recreation proposals, etc. -Determining relative amounts of management responsibility for specific biological resources among land stewards to facilitate cooperative management and planning. -Basic research on regional distributions of plants and animals and to help target both specific species and geographic areas for needed research. -Environmental impact assessment for large projects or military activities. -Estimation of potential economic impacts from loss of biological resource-based activities. -Education at all levels and for both students and citizens. Inappropriate Uses: It is far easier to identify appropriate uses than inappropriate ones, however, there is a \"fuzzy line\" that is eventually crossed when the differences in resolution of the data, size of geographic area being analyzed, and precision of the answer required for the question are no longer compatible. Examples include: -Using the data to map small areas (less than thousands of hectares), typically requiring mapping resolution at 1:24,000 scale and using aerial photographs or ground surveys. -Combining these data with other data finer than 1:100,000 scale to produce new hybrid maps or answer queries. -Generating specific areal measurements from the data finer than the nearest thousand hectares -Establishing exact boundaries for regulation or acquisition. -Establishing definite occurrence or non-occurrence of any feature for an exact geographic area -Determining abundance, health, or condition of any feature. -Establishing a measure of accuracy of any other data by comparison with GAP data. -Altering the data in any way and redistributing them as a GAP data product. -Using the data without acquiring and reviewing the metadata and this report.", "Access Constraints: These data are in the public domain."]"
