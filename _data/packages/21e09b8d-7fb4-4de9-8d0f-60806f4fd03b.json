	"notes": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducted this study because of the potential that DDTM (DDT and its metabolites, DDD and DDE) and other organochlorine pesticides were above concern levels in fish, wood ducks, and fish-eating birds using Mathews Brake National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). We collected the fish from Mathews Brake NWR but could not collect the wood ducks and fish-eating birds from the refuge because of access problems. As a result, the wood ducks and fish-eating birds were collected from Morgan Brake NWR because the two refuges are only a few miles apart and the birds were using both refuges. Another objective of the study was to determine if endocrine disruption was occurring in the fish and fish-eating birds. DDTM concentrations in all fish samples were below concern levels. This finding indicates that organochlorine pesticides concentrations in fish from Mathews Brake NWR have significantly declined from the concentrations found by Shea et al. (2001) in 1996. We believe the decrease in DDTM concentrations in fish is due partly to the increase in no-till farming in the watershed of the refuge. Although DDE concentrations appeared to be elevated in two great egret tissue samples, all samples contained DDE concentrations below levels likely to pose a significant risk to fish-eating birds. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were also elevated in one of the great egret tissue samples but were not at concentrations that would result in adverse effects. All wood duck tissue samples contained DDE concentrations well below concern levels. Analyses of fish blood plasma indicated that endocrine disruption was not a problem on the refuge. Endocrine disruption was observed in only one of the fish blood plasma samples. The histological evaluations of fish gonads indicated that fish were generally in good reproductive health. Recommendations are provided in the report to protect and enhance fish and wildlife resources on the refuges.",
