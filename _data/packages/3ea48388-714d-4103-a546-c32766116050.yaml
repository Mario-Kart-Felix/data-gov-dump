    University of Houston Clear Lake have teamed to develop a widely extensible, affordable,
    energy efficient, smart lighting device known as Lambda-Net.  Smart building technologies,
    such as Lambda-Net, are becoming critical to energy savings and sustainability for
    terrestrial applications and space-based habitats.  Our device incorporates a smart-mobile
    device or other comparable sized integrated computing/sensing device into each LED
    fixture. Smart-mobile devices are ideally suited to perform energy saving lighting
    control as they contain inexpensive, mass produced, highly integrated imaging, computing
    and communication technologies. The low cost digital cameras within these packages
    become highly capable imaging photosensors using calibration techniques developed
    for NASA satellites and the commercial remote sensing industry. Novel algorithms
    utilize lighting information measured by the photosensors to individually tailor
    the intensity and spectral content of the light generated from each LED fixture
    within the lighting system to reduce energy usage, increase lighting efficacy and
    improve circadian rhythm influenced activities such as sleeping and concentration.
     Advanced spatially distributed occupancy sensing and lighting control further
    reduces energy usage.  Integrating sensing and computing into each light fixture
    also provides the infrastructure to create a robust sensor network. Network communication
    is achieved through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other communication means, such as the
    power lines that provide electricity to each fixture. This resulting sensor network
    enables a wide range of terrestrial and space-based applications including monitoring:
    building/habitat temperature, humidity and air quality; occupant health and safety;
    building/habitat space utilization and astronaut activity including deep space adaptation
    in addition to providing high quality spatially selectable, spectrally programmable
    illumination.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
