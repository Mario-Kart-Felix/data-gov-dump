	"notes": "Deployable Space Systems (DSS) will focus the proposed Phase 2 SBIR program on the hardware-based development and TRL advance of a highly-modularized and extremely-scalable solar array (Mega-ROSA) that provides immense power level range capability from 100kW to many Megawatts in size. Mega-ROSA will enable extremely high power spacecraft applications, including: Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) spacecraft, SEP space-tug, and large-scale Planetary and Human Exploration missions because of its ground-breaking stowed packaging efficiency, high deployed stiffness / strength, low-cost and straightforward ground test capability. The innovative and synergistic Mega-ROSA solutions, to be validated to a TRL 6 level during the proposed Phase 2 program, will enable future high power missions through low cost (25-50&#37; cost savings depending on PV and blanket technology), high specific power (&gt;200 W/kg to 400 W/kg BOL at the wing level depending on PV and blanket technology), extremely compact stowage volume (&gt;50 kW/m3 for very large arrays), high deployment reliability, platform simplicity (low parts count and reduced potential failure modes), high deployed strength/stiffness (&gt;5X stiffer and stronger than rigid panel arrays of similar sizes), high voltage capability, scalability to ultra-high power (100kW to several Megawatts), and operability in unique environments (high/low illumination, high/low sun intensity and high radiation).",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
