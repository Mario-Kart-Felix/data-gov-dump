  in wildlife at Agassiz National Wildlife Refuge are summarized below: Cadmium, chromium
  and mercury concentrations in colonial waterbirds and tree swallows at Agassiz National
  Wildlife Refuge. Extremely high cadmium (Cd) concentrations and elevated mercury
  (Hg) and chromium (Cr) concentrations were reported in eggs and feathers of waterbirds
  nesting at Agassiz National Wildlife Refuge (Agassiz) in 1994. Chromium concentrations
  in livers of immature Franklinu2019s gulls were also exceptionally high. To determine
  the effects of these metals on nesting birds at Agassiz, waterbird (Franklinu2019s
  gull, black-crowned night-heron, eared grebe, and pied-billed grebe), and tree swallow
  eggs and chicks were collected at Agassiz during 1998-2001 and analyzed for trace
  elements including Cd, Cr, and Hg. In contrast to the 1994 study, Cd and Cr concentrations
  were not elevated in waterbird or tree swallow eggs or chicks. Mercury concentrations
  in waterbird eggs from Agassiz were comparable or less than concentrations reported
  in 1994. Cadmium, Cr, and Hg concentrations in waterbirds and tree swallows nesting
  at Agassiz were not at toxic levels. Trace element concentrations in eggs and livers
  of colonial waterbirds and tree swallows following the 2000 pool drawdown at Agassiz
  National Wildlife Refuge. Water drawdown is a management tool often used to improve
  the habitat quality of wetlands. Flooding of sediment can increase the production
  of methylmercury and increase its bioavailability. The main pool at Agassiz was
  drawn down in 2000. Waterbird and tree swallow eggs and chicks were collected at
  Agassiz in 1998, 1999, 2000 (tree swallows only), and 2001 to determine the potential
  effects of the 2000 drawdown on subsequent trace element concentrations. Trace elements,
  including mercury, did not increase in waterbirds and tree swallows following the
  2000 drawdown at Agassiz. The lack of a mercury response in birds at Agassiz in
  2001 may have been related to limited drying of Agassiz Pool during the 2000 drawdown.
  Trace elements in moose from northwestern Minnesota. The moose population in bog
  and forested areas of northwestern Minnesota has declined for over 25 years, and
  more recently the decline is throughout northwestern Minnesota. Both deficiencies
  and elevations in trace elements have been linked to the health of moose worldwide.
  The objective of this study was to measure trace element concentrations in livers
  of moose found dead in northwestern Minnesota and to determine either deficient
  or elevated levels. Livers of 81 moose found dead in northwestern Minnesota in 1998
  and 1999 were analyzed for trace elements. With the exception of Se and Cu, trace
  elements were not at toxic or deficient levels based on criteria set for cattle.
  Selenium concentrations in moose livers were deficient in 18.5%, adequate to high
  in 65.5%, and at a chronic toxicity level in 16%. Copper concentrations were deficient
  in 39.5% of livers, marginally deficient in 29.5% of livers, and adequate in 31%
  of livers. Copper deficiency, which has been associated with population declines
  of moose in Alaska and Sweden, may be a factor contributing to the decline of moose
  in northwestern Minnesota.\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"License Not Specified\",\n\t\"extras\":
