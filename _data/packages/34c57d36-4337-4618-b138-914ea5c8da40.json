	"notes": "Fission-based power systems with power levels of 30 to &amp;#8805;100 kWe will be needed for planetary surface bases. Development of high temperature, high efficiency heat exchangers is critical for next-generation nuclear power and space propulsion systems. In Phase I, Ultramet and Sandia National Laboratories demonstrated the feasibility of using high surface area foam core heat exchanger technology to substantially improve the power conversion efficiency of liquid metal-to-gas high temperature heat exchangers for fission surface power systems. Preliminary design and modeling suggested a substantial improvement in the efficiency of a liquid lithium-to-helium component relative to conventional plate-fin heat exchangers, and hardware fabrication and testing demonstrated the manufacturability, performance, and simplicity of the foam-based design. Open-cell foam is a natural coolant channel that does not require extensive, expensive machining of intricate coolant passages and eliminates the need for braze-bonding or welding of numerous individual sections. Initial testing showed the ability of textured, vapor-deposited lithium-compatible coatings to be uniformly wetted by liquid lithium at low temperature. The technology has the potential to best minimize the temperature difference between the maximum lithium reactor coolant and helium working fluid temperatures, as well as to reduce system mass and volume through the use of high surface area, low density open-cell foam, and increase safety and reliability by minimizing the number of piece parts and associated joints. In Phase II, Ultramet will team with Sandia to expand on the Phase I success by performing comprehensive design and stress analysis, determining physical properties, and establishing performance through high temperature (1000 K) thermal response and flow testing of coaxial heat exchangers using the Helium Flow Loop and Liquid Metal Integrated Test System at Sandia's Plasma Materials Test Facility.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
