    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Loss of control is a significant cause of
    aviation accidents attributed to a large percentage of fatalities in the commercial
    aviation sector. Recently, Barron Associates, Inc. (BAI) has developed a system
    for unmanned aerial vehicles that autonomously executes recovery strategies to rapidly
    restore nominal flight. During Phase I, BAI sought to extend this system to manned
    vehicles by developing a joint human-automated (H/A) system. The goal of this system
    is to assist the crew during the recovery process by conveying information about
    recovery procedures in an intuitive and unobtrusive manner. BAI developed crew-specific
    extensions to the automated system both at the architecture and interface level.
    The architecture defines what information is delivered to the crew. The interface
    defines how this information is presented to the crew. Metrics were defined to measure
    the quality of the recovery and crew experience. Phase I pilot-in-the-loop experiments
    have shown there is the potential for significant performance gains and workload
    reduction if the joint H/A recovery system is used to guide the pilot through the
    recovery process. Phase I experiments were limited in scope. During Phase II, BAI
    would like to build upon these results by demonstrating that gains become even more
    pronounced in a realistic cockpit environment. This will require migrating to a
    higher-quality simulator and more accurately simulating the duties of the crew.
    The team will target ATPs (Airline Transport Pilots) during Phase II and expand
    the subject population so that the benefit of the system can be explicitly quantified.
    While integration into the cockpit is the ultimate goal for this system, BAI believes
    that the joint H/A recovery system can be of immediate use as a training aid. As
    part of the experimental build-up, BAI would also like to show that the use of the
    joint H/A recovery system during training translates into improved pilot recoveries
    when the system is not active.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
