  \"the-design-and-integration-of-a-distributed-fan-propulsion-system-within-a-split-wing-proj\",\n\t\"isopen\":
  true,\n\t\"url\": null,\n\t\"notes\": \"A baseline propulsion system has been designed
  as a starting point in a previous SBIR effort for this project which consists of
  two turboshaft engines, a generator coupled directly (no gearbox) with each engine,
  and electric cables to motors that drive shrouded fans installed in or over the
  wing.  For this baseline, there are eight fans per wing, and the turboshaft engines
  use kerosene fuel as the energy source.  One major issue faced by this type of configuration
  is the propulsion integration of not only the structure with motors in a split wing,
  but also the aerodynamics of such a configuration.  In the previous study, high
  pressure recovery inlets, exhaust nozzle area control, thrust vectoring and variable
  pitch fans were considered, along with the initial layout of the entire structural
  integration.  The work proposed here aims to further address these concerns and
  outline a potential fan, inlet and nozzle design methodology for split-wing distributed
  propulsion.  This methodology can be turned into a design tool, for which the framework
  will be created as part of this study to be fully completed in a possible Phase
  II.  In addition, and most important to this topic, several aerodynamic aircraft
  concepts have also been looked at under currently supported work with California
  Polytechnic State University on their N+2 NRA contract to study future CESTOL aircraft
  and during internal study efforts at ESAero.  The work proposed here will complement
  much of that work by taking a better look at some novel integration arrangements
  in the configurations.  This will specifically address overall vehicle efficiency
  by looking at the aerodynamic concepts inherently designed into the aircraft.  This
  will be an important part of the study, as a properly integrated distributed propulsion
  system will offer the means to reduce \"specific\" fuel consumption, thereby increasing
  aircraft operating efficiencies to reduce overall mission fuel burn. \",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
