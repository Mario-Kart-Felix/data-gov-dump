    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "A remaining useful life prediction methodology
    for elec- trolytic capacitors is presented. This methodology is based on the Kalman
    filter framework and an empirical degradation model. Electrolytic capacitors are
    used in several applications ranging from power supplies on critical avionics equipment
    to power drivers for electro-mechanical actuators. These devices are known for their
    comparatively low reliability and given their criticality in electronics subsystems
    they are a good can- didate for component level prognostics and health manage- ment.
    Prognostics provides a way to assess remaining use- ful life of a capacitor based
    on its current state of health and its anticipated future usage and operational
    conditions. We present here also, experimental results of an accelerated ag- ing
    test under electrical stresses. The data obtained in this test form the basis for
    a remaining life prediction algorithm where a model of the degradation process is
    suggested. This prelim- inary remaining life prediction algorithm serves as a demon-
    stration of how prognostics methodologies could be used for electrolytic capacitors.
    In addition, the use degradation pro- gression data from accelerated aging, provides
    an avenue for validation of applications of the Kalman filter based prognos- tics
    methods typically used for remaining useful life predic- tions in other applications.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
