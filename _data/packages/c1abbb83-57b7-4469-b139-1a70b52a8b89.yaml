    point locations for all Environmental Justice (EJ) grants given out by the US EPA.
    There are many limitations to the data so it is advised that these metadata be read
    carefully before use. Although the records for these grant locations are drawn directly
    from the official EPA grants repository (IGMS ufffd Integrated Grants Management
    System), it is important to know that the IGMS was designed for purposes that did
    not include accurately portraying the grantufffds place of performance on a map.
    Instead, the IGMS grant recipientufffds mailing address is the primary source for
    grant locations. Particularly for statewide grants that are administered via State
    and Regional headquarters, the grant location data should not be interpreted as
    the grantufffds place of performance. In 2012, a policy was established to start
    to collect the place of performance as a pilot for newly awarded grants ufffd that
    were deemed ufffdcommunity-basedufffd in nature and for these the grant location
    depicted in this database will be a more reliable indicator of the actual place
    of performance. As for the locational accuracy of these points, there is no programmatic
    certification process, however, they are being entered by the Grant Project Officers
    who are most familiar with the details of the grants, apart from the grantees themselves.
    Limitations notwithstanding, this is a first-of-breed attempt to map all of the
    Agencyufffds grants, using the best internal geocoding algorithms available, and
    is a useful tool for getting to an understanding of the distribution of USEPA grant-giving.
    The EJ Grants layer contains Places of Performance for single locations or areas
    where EJ grants are applied. This layer consists of grant data that is derived from
    an Environmental Justice grant program. This includes any grants that have a Catalogue
    of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) code identifier of 66.604, signifying Environmental
    Justice Hazardous Substances Research Small Grants to Community Groups and Environmental
    Justice Small Grants Program for Community Research. It also contains any grant
    whose program code acronym is equivalent to EJ (Environmental Justice Community/University
    Partnership Grants Program), EQ (Environmental Justice Small Grant Program), TJ
    (State and Tribal Grants for Environmental Justice), PS (Environmental Justice Collaborative
    Problem-Solving Grants Program), EP (Environmental Justice Assistance), or RJ (Environmental
    Justice Research Assistance). In addition to the above program code and CFDA code
    criteria, this data contains grants from the following grant programs: Environmental
    Justice Pollution Prevention Grants Program Surveys, Studies, Investigations, and
    Special Purpose Activities Relating to Environmental Justice Environmental Justice
    Training and Fellowship Assistance Assistance to Nonprofit Organizations with Activities
    Relating to Environmental Justice Environmental Justice Hazardous Substances Research
    Small Grants to Community Groups State Environmental Justice Cooperative Agreement
