	"notes": "This is an assessment of water quality data collected from source water, discharge and within Agassiz Pool. In the summer of 2012, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service initiated water quality sampling on inlets, outlets and within-pool portions of Agassiz Pool, Agassiz NWR largest wetland impoundment. Current water quality monitoring was initiated in response to potential threats identified by two recent studies which measured sediment and nutrient loading within Agassiz Pool, its tributaries and outlets (Schottler and Engstrom, 2011; USGS, 2012). The goal of current water quality monitoring at Agassiz NWR is to: 1) track trends in water quality and quantity conditions relative to Watershed and Refuge management actions and 2) provide a better understanding of sediment and nutrient dynamics within Agassiz Pool. Drought conditions during the 2012 sampling period allowed for the measurement of water quality conditions within Agassiz Pool with very little influence from incoming or outgoing flows. These data may be important in the future when comparing nutrient cycling capabilities under various water level management scenarios. Water monitoring data, aerial imagery and on-site inspections coordinated with the drawdown of Agassiz Pool in 2012 indicate extensive sheet flow, vegetation disturbance and discrete periods of channel formation and sediment scour within Agassiz Pool. Further monitoring is needed to understand the relationship between Pool levels, the management of the Ditch-11 Outlet WCS and streamflow.The initial results suggest that the 2012 drawdown was effective in removing water, drying soils and disturbing vegetation and soils in an isolated area around the Main WCS. Sampling results for all sites in 2012 produced predictably low Total Suspended Sediment (TSS) concentrations due to the lack of runoff during the sampling period. Samples collected in the non-flowing waters of Agassiz Pool produced consistently low TSS concentrations, while samples from the inlet, channel and outlets sites varied widely. Relative to the other samples, Ditch-11 and the Agassiz Pool North Channel (within Pool) samples produced consistently high TSS concentrations when sampled. The ratio of inorganic to organic material within sampled sediments was found to be primarily inorganic at inlet and outlet sites (sites with active streamflow) and primarily organic at in-Pool (non-flowing) sites. In 2012, TSS concentrations were so low that the composition of sediments is considered less significant than it would be during periods of high sediment transport. Water samples analyzed for various forms of nitrogen and phosphorus at inlet and outlet sites were consistent with data collected by the USGS in 2008-2010 (2012). Although some concentrations were slightly elevated, sample results were mostly below the available state standards for each constituent. In-Pool samples, along with continuous water quality parameter data indicate a wetland system with pronounced primary and secondary production. Although this type of nutrient cycling is normal for wetlands, the dramatic changes in water chemistry over short time periods in Agassiz Pool may indicate accelerated cycling due to an excess of nutrients. This condition should continue to be closely monitored to better define the range of water chemistry changes in the Pool and to consider potential impacts for habitats and wildlife. Of particular concern is the influence of nutrient concentrations and availability in exotic narrow leaf cattail production and the potential for large algal blooms if the current nutrient dynamics were to shift, especially with elevated concentrations of Total Nitrogen (TN) and Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP). It is likely that large volumes of nitrogen and phosphorus are contained within Refuge ditch and wetland substrate, meaning that the availability of these constituents may be slow to reflect any changes in management or upstream best management practices.",
