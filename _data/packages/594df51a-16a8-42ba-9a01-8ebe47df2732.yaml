    time (00:01:39.8 UTC) a magnitude (Mw) 7.4 earthquake occurred along the westernmost
    North Anatolian fault. The earthquake epicenter was 11 km (7 mi) southeast of the
    City of Izmit, in the sub-province of Kocaeli, a densely populated area in the industrial
    heartland of Turkey, and less than 80 km southeast of Istanbul.The Anatolian fault,
    a right lateral strike-slip fault, has a history of earthquakes. (A right-lateral,
    strike-slip fault is one in which the motion of the opposite side of the fault,
    as one looks across the fault, is to the right.) In the last sixty years, there
    have been eleven earthquakes with magnitudes (Ms) larger than 6.7 along this fault.
    The August 1999 quake was located in a seismic gap between areas of the fault that
    had broken in 1967 and in 1963. The maximum displacement along the fault was more
    than five meters. The total rupture length was nearly 170 km. Accelerograms showed
    that the earthquake consisted of two major events located about 30 km apart.The
    earthquake damaged buildings across seven provinces for a distance of 250 km from
    Istanbul to Bolu. As many as seventy percent of the buildings in portions of the
    cities of Adapazari, Golcuk, Izmit, Topcular, and Kular were severely damaged or
    collapsed. Nearly all the fatalities and injuries can be attributed to building
    collapse. An estimated 60,000-115,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed. Damage
    - estimates range from $10 billion to $40 billion. The fault crossed some of the
    most densely populated regions of Turkey. The affected population numbered 15 million
    people. Casualties totaled 17,000 and additional thousands were missing and presumed
    dead. Injuries numbered 24,000 and 500,000 people were left homeless with 200,000
    living on the streets. The economics of the damaged region presented ten percent
    of the Gross National Product of Turkey.Structural damage occurred in several ways.
    Many structures were deformed or destroyed by the lateral and vertical offsets of
    the fault itself. Several apartment buildings were torn apart by the fault rupture
    and collapsed. There was great variation of response even among similarly constructed
    buildings in the same neighborhood, with some collapsing and others having moderate
    or little apparent damage. Residential buildings were usually three to seven stories
    in height. The predominant structural type in Turkey consists of reinforced concrete
    frames with unreinforced masonry infill (brick walls filling the gaps between concrete
    frames). These infill walls tended to fall out with the earthquake shaking, adding
    stress to the beams and columns.Failures occurred in foundations, and in soft stories.
    These are stories that have few supporting walls and are often found in the first
    story of a structure. They may be open stories in order to accommodate shops or
    a garage, and may have few walls supporting the second story floor. Failures also
    occurred in weak columns paired with strong beams, and in columns with lack of detailing
    and column confinement. Buildings having four or more stories were much more likely
    to be damaged or to collapse since the buildings with greater height incurred a
    greater amount of displacement at the top relative to the bottom of the buildings.
    In some areas, buildings were subjected to damaging ground settlement, liquefaction,
    or subsidence and inundation from lake waters. Hundreds of buildings in the city
    of Adapazari settled, tipped, or toppled as liquefaction weakened lakebed sediments.
    In the severe liquefaction areas, more than sixty percent of multi-story buildings
    suffered partial or total collapse due to structural failure. With the exception
    of the most heavily damaged areas, the water system was functional in six days or
    less. There was no significant damage reported to dams or reservoirs. Wastewater
    pipelines were heavily damaged. Electric power was disrupted when buildings collapsed
    onto electrical lines, electrical poles tilted or collapsed, and transformers tilted
    due to support failure. However, the electric power service was nearly restored
    in two weeks. Some highway bridges were damaged when fault rupture occurred beneath
    them. Only a few residential fires were reported, since most building materials
    were fire-resistant, and there are no natural gas pipelines in the region. Following
    the earthquake, fire broke out at the large Tupas Oil Refinery in Korfez. One fire
    at the refinery resulted when a collapsed 90-meter reinforced concrete stack knocked
    down equipment and pipeways. An oil spill from the refinery contaminated the waters
    of Izmit Bay. Loss of electrical power, debris on the roads, and lack of water hampered
    firefighting efforts. A number of damaging quakes have occurred in this area in
    the past. In 1754, the area near Izmit experienced an earthquake that resulted in
    2,000 deaths. In 1967, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake occurred near Izmit. In 1970,
    an earthquake near Gediz, 160 km (100 mi) to the south, killed 1,000 people. This
    area of Turkey will continue to experience seismic activity. Appropriate steps need
    to be taken now to minimize the effects and fatalities of the next earthquake.",nt"license_title":
