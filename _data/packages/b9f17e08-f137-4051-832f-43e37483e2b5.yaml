  geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore of Half Moon Bay map area, California.
  The vector data file is included in \"Geology_OffshoreHalfMoonBay.zip,\" which is
  accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreHalfMoonBay/data_catalog_OffshoreHalfMoonBay.html.
  The continental shelf within California's State waters in the Half Moon Bay area
  is shallow (0 to ~55 m) and flat with a very gentle (less than 0.5 degrees) offshore
  dip. The morphology and geology of this shelf result from the interplay between
  local tectonics, sea-level rise, sedimentary processes, and oceanography. Tectonic
  influences are related to local faulting and uplift (see below). Sea level has risen
  about 125 to 130 m over the last ~21,000 years (for example, Lambeck and Chappel,
  2001; Gornitz, 2009), leading to progressive eastward migration (a few tens of km)
  of the shoreline and wave-cut platform and associated transgressive erosion and
  deposition (for example, Catuneanu, 2006). The Offshore of Half Moon Bay map area
  is now an open-ocean shelf that is subjected to full, and sometimes severe, wave
  energy and strong currents. Given the relatively shallow depths and high energy,
  modern shelf deposits are mostly sand (unit Qms). More coarse-grained sands and
  gravels (units Qmss and Qmsc) are primarily recognized on the basis of bathymetry
  and high backscatter (Bathymetry; Backscatter A [8101]; and Backscatter B [7125]--Offshore
  Half Moon Bay, California, DS 781). Unit Qmsc occurs only as a nearshore bar (~
  10 m water depth) just south of the Pillar Point Harbor jetty. Unit Qmss forms erosional
  lags in rippled scour depressions (see, for example, Cacchione and others, 1984)
  and is more extensive and distributed, with the largest concentrations occurring
  at water depths of 30 to 55 m offshore Pillar Point, and in the nearshore (depths
  of 5 to 15 m) south of Pillar Point Harbor and north-northwest of Pillar Point.
  Such rippled-scour depressions are common along this stretch of the California coast
  where offshore sandy sediment can be relatively thin (thus unable to fill the depressions)
  due to both lack of sediment supply from rivers and to significant sediment erosion
  and offshore transport during large winter storms. Although the general areas in
  which both unit Qmss scour depressions and unit Qmsc bars occur are not likely to
  change substantially, the boundaries of the unit(s) are likely ephemeral, changing
  seasonally and during significant storm events. Areas where shelf sediments form
  thin (< 2.5 m or less) veneers over low relief Purisima Formation (upper Miocene
  and Pliocene) or undifferentiated Cretaceous and (or) Tertiary bedrock are mapped
  as units Qms/Tp and Qms/TKu. These areas are recognized based on the combination
  of flat relief, continuity with moderate to high relief bedrock outcrops, high-resolution
  seismic-reflection data (see field activity S-15-10-NC), and in some cases moderate
  to high backscatter. These units are regarded as ephemeral and dynamic sediment
  layers that may or may not be present at a specific location based on storms, seasonal/annual
  patterns of sediment movement, or longer-term climate cycles. In a nearby similarly
  high-energy setting, Storlazzi and others (2011) have described seasonal burial
  and exhumation of submerged bedrock in northern Monterey Bay. Offshore bedrock outcrops
  are mapped as the upper Miocene and Pliocene Purisima Formation (unit Tp), the Cretaceous
  granitic rocks of Montara Mountain (unit Kgr), and undivided sedimentary rocks of
  Cretaceous and (or) Tertiary age (unit TKu). These units are delineated through
  extending outcrops and trends from mapped onshore geology and from their distinctive
  surface textures as revealed by high-resolution bathymetry (Bathymetry--Offshore
  Half Moon Bay, California, DS 781). Purisima Formation outcrops form distinctive
  straight to curved \"ribs,\" caused by differential erosion of more- and less-resistant
  lithologies (for example, sandstone and mudstone). In contrast, granitic rocks have
  a densely cross-fractured surface texture. Map unit polygons were digitized over
  underlying 2-meter base layers developed from multibeam bathymetry and backscatter
  data. The bathymetry and backscatter data were collected between 2006 and 2010.
