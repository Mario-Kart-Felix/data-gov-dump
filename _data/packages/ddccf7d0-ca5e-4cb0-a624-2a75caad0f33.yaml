    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "This data set contains three files (.txt
    format). Two of the files contain stand characteristics, above- and below-ground
    biomass, and above- and below-ground production allocation data for Scots pine (Pinus
    sylvestris) forests near Jadraas, Sweden. One file is for a young regenerating forest
    (14-20 years old) and the other is for an old-growth forest (120-125 years old).
    The field measurements were made by destructive and non-destructive methods between
    1973 and 1983. The third file contains climate data recorded at the Jadraas site
    from 1974 through 1990.The research was conducted under the auspices of SWECON (Swedish
    Coniferous Forest Biome) Project to enhance understanding of plant biomass dynamics
    and factors regulating plant growth. Most of the research concerned plant and vegetation
    processes, but particular interest was also given to soil processes, consumption
    processes, and energy and water exchange in the canopy and the soil.Total net primary
    production (NPP) in the young forest was estimated at 860 g/m2/year (above-ground
    = 372 g/m2/year; below-ground = 488 g/m2/year). NPP for the old-growth forest was
    not calculated; however, the data set contains estimates of branch and trunk growth
    (43 g/m2/year and 106 g/m2/year, respectively), annual litterfall (135-162 g/m2/year),
    needle grazing loss (1.55 g/m2/year), fine tree root production (188 g/m2/year),
    and understory root production (30 g/m2/year).Revision Notes: The NPP data file
    has been split into two files, one for the young regenerating forest and one for
    old-growth forest. The data files have been revised to correct previously reported
    data and information and to add new data from published sources. Please see the
    ORNL DAAC Data Set Change Information file for more information. ",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
