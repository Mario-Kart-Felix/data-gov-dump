	"notes": "We propose to develop a compact, robust, optically-based sensor fornmaking temperature and multi-species concentration measurements innaircraft system ground and flight test environments. This system willnutilize a widely tunable near infrared light source to make absorptionnmeasurements of gas constituents in the propulsion system (combustionnreactant and products in the combustion zone, with accuracy fromn100-1000 ppm), aircraft cabin air, and fuel tank/on-board gas generatornsystems. The light source will be able to continuously tune from 0.4 ton2.3 microns while maintaining a narrow bandwidth of 0.01 cm-1 using annovel combination of acousto- and electro-optically controlled devices.nThe rapid tunability of this light source will obviate the need forndense multiplexing of multiple wavelengths as signals can be multiplexednin time while maintaining fast temporal response. Furthermore, the widenspectral bandwidth allows for the selection of the optimum absorptionntransitions, without regard for the commercial availability of narrownbandwidth diode lasers. The proposed instrumentation will benenvironmentally rugged, with the ability to withstand extreme ranges ofntemperature, humidity, vibration and shock conditions.  Further, thensystem will possess auto-calibration capabilities, fast response timen(few microseconds) and can be battery operated.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
