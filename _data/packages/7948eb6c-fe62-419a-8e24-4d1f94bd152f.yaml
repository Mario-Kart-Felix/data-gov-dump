    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The world-wide aviation system is one of
    the most complex dynamical systems ever developed and is generating data at an extremely
    rapid rate. Most modern commercial aircraft record several hundred flight parameters
    including information from the guidance, navigation, and control systems, the avionics
    and propulsion systems, and the pilot inputs into the aircraft. These parameters
    may be continuous measurements or binary or categorical measurements recorded in
    one second intervals for the duration of the flight. Currently, most approaches
    to aviation safety are reactive, meaning that they are designed to react to an aviation
    safety incident or accident. In this paper, we discuss a novel approach based on
    the theory of multiple kernel learning to detect potential safety anomalies in very
    large data bases of discrete and continuous data from world-wide operations of commercial
    fleets. We pose a general anomaly detection problem which includes both discrete
    and continuous data streams, where we assume that the discrete streams have a causal
    influence on the continuous streams. We also assume that atypical sequences of events
    in the discrete streams can lead to off-nominal system performance. We discuss the
    application domain, novel algorithms, and also discuss results on real-world data
    sets. Our algorithm uncovers operationally significant events in high dimensional
    data streams in thernaviation industry which are not detectable using state of the
    art methods.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
