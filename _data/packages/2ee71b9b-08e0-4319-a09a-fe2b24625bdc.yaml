    (MDO) tools developed to perform multi-disciplinary analysis based on low fidelity
    computation methods have been used in aircraft conceptual design for decades.  These
    tools have been proven very effective for simple problems and mostly have been developed
    as a single codes.  However, as analyses have become more complex and the need to
    consider more design factors crucial, such codes have grown so large as to be inconceivable
    and difficult to maintain.  Nowadays, the design optimization process of a modern
    airplane must account for all failure modes and behavior constraints.  In addition,
    it should cover manufacturing constraints and limitations on available resources,
    such as power, weight, and cost, simultaneously.  This has to be done in an integrated
    way, so that the effects of any change in the design on all constraints and behavior
    measures are accurately modeled, and all interactions and trade-offs among design
    variables and disciplines are allowed to affect the design.rnZONA Technology (ZONA)
    and its team member (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University), hereinafter
    referred to as "the ZONA team", propose in Phase I to develop a multi-fidelity,
    multi-strategy and multi-disciplinary design optimization environment, called the
    M3 Design Optimization Environment (M3 DOE) that consists of a three-layer optimization
    strategy, a multi-fidelity aerodynamic discipline, and a finite element analysis
    including outer mold line morphing and topology re-meshing capability.  The M3 DOE
    allows the designer to select an appropriate optimization strategy and an aerodynamic
    method with an appropriate fidelity to obtain an optimum design with desired accuracy
    within the allowable time constraint.rn",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
