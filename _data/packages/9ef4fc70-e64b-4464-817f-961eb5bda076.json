	"notes": "The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japan satellite mission to monitor tropical and subtropical precipitation and to estimate its associated latent heating. TRMM was successfully launched on November 27, 1997 at 4:27 PM (EST) from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan.nnThe TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR), the first of its kind in space, is an electronically scanning radar, operating at 13.8 GHz that measures the 3-D rainfall distribution over both land and ocean, and defines the layer depth of the precipitation.nnThe primary objective of the 3A26 is to compute the rain rate statistics over 5 degree (latitude) x 5 degree (longitude) x 1 month space-time regions. The output products include the estimated values of the probability distribution function of the space-time rain rates at 4 &apos;levels&apos; (2 km, 4 km, 6 km, and path-averaged) and the mean, standard deviation, and probability of rain derived from these distributions. Three different rain rate estimates are used for the high resolution rain rate inputs to the algorithm: (1) the standard Z-R (or 0th-order estimate having no attenuation correction), (2) the Hitschfeld-Bordan (H-B), and (3) the rain rates taken from 2A25. (Fits based on the high resolution inputs from the surface reference technique are output to the diagnostic file for evaluation).nnThis algorithm is based on a statistical procedure. Although the radar team believes that a statistical method of this type should be implemented for TRMM, the method is relatively new and the testing has been carried out only on simulated data and on preliminary TRMM data. Caution on the use of the results is well warranted.nnSpatial coverage is between 40 degrees North and 40 degrees South, owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite.nnThe data are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), which includes both core and product specific metadata applicable to the PR measurements. A file consists of arrays of rain rate data and supporting information, each of dimension 72 x 16, for three fixed heights (2, 4, and 6 km) and the path-averaged rain rates.  The file size is about 16 MB (uncompressed). The HDF-EOS &quot;swath&quot; structure is used to accommodate the actual geophysical data arrays. There is 1 file of PR 3A26 data produced per month.",

What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
