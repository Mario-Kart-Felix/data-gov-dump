	"notes": "NASA has a critical requirement for a wearable device that can provide objective measures of sleep and activity for its crew during long duration spaceflight. In the proposed program, we will develop an unobtrusive wrist worn monitor that places minimum burden on the crew in operating the device. The device, once worn, requires no action from the crew and automatically records and analyzes actigraphy and sleep data. The device will have battery life of about one year and wireless data transfer so the crew will not be burdened with recharging the device and downloading data from the device. The monitoring device will provide real-time feedback on the level of activity and duration and quality of sleep. The proposed device is based on an existing sleep and activity monitor which we will modify and enhance to make it suitable for use in spaceflight environments. Data format, including epoch length and sleep statistics provided by the proposed system will conform to formats currently used in sleep research. In Phase 1, we will deliver a set of fully functional devices that can be deployed in spaceflight analogs. We will also perform feasibility studies of a Phase 2 unit, which will measure, in addition to sleep, activity and heart rate, other physiological parameters such as heart rate variability, blood pressure, vasoconstriction, pulsewave velocity, and electrodermal activity. Since the work is based on an existing sleep and activity monitoring platform, we expect that the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the Phase 1 unit to be at 7, and the Phase 2 unit to be at 8.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
