    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "In this highly interconnected world, transportation
    systems must feature increased flexibility and shorter door-to-door trip times to
    be successful.  Shorter door-to-door trip times require an increased usage of rotary
    wing and runway independent V/STOL technology.  One of the limiting factors to the
    increased adoption of this technology for providing feeder service to major hubs
    is the limited understanding of high-volume terminal area operations.rnrnSeveral
    important issues are associated with rotary wing and runway independent V/STOL aircraft,
    including severe aerodynamic interactions during take-off, transition and landing.
    There is also the possibility that the aero-acoustic environment generated in the
    terminal area may cause damage to buildings, unsafe working conditions for ground
    personnel, or unacceptable noise levels to surrounding communities.rnrnThe success
    of commercial V/STOL transportation is predicated on being able to establish technical
    feasibility, societal acceptance and economic viability. The proposed aero-acoustic
    tool for terminal area operations offers a simulation capability to design engineers
    to make informed decisions based on technical (operations and handling near a terminal),
    societal (acoustic footprint) and economic considerations (performance) that includes
    the interactional aerodynamics between the aircraft and its surroundings. The designers
    and operators of rotary wing and V/STOL aircrafts will use the tool to evaluate,
    enhance and implement more efficient and safe terminal area operation guidelines.rnrnPhase
    I will develop the proof-of-concept of the simulation tool and use a tilt-rotor
    and a candidate terminal under different wind conditions to demonstrate its usefulness.
     In Phase II, the tool will be extended to maneuvering rotary wing and V/STOL aircrafts.
     In addition, it will be integrated with a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease
    of use.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
