  is NASA&amp;rsquo;s primary center for atmospheric flight research and operations,&amp;nbsp;with
  a vision &amp;ldquo;to fly what others only imagine.&amp;rdquo; We believe that
  flight validation and research is one of&amp;nbsp;the crucial phases within the
  advancement of any NASA technology, and it is often the barrier to technology&amp;nbsp;utilization
  by the private sector. We also believe that aerospace technology can be enhanced
  through flight&amp;nbsp;early in the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) lifecycle.
  In fact, some research can be done only in flight. The&amp;nbsp;CIF projects are
  examples of aerospace technologies that are theoretically advantageous but have
  had&amp;nbsp;little TRL advancement or are at too early of a technology level for
  support through a NASA mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus for the program is on
  validating, developing, and testing new and innovative technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
  current&amp;nbsp;technology areas for the projects included:&lt;br /&gt;AFRC is
  currently looking into following Technical Capability areas (not in any priority
  order and not all inclusive):&lt;br /&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Small
  launch Space Systems&lt;br /&gt;Develop small launch space systems such as horizontal
  rockets that could launch to orbit small free-flying space platforms (e.g., cuestas,
  nanosats, picosats).&lt;br /&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Altitude Compensating
  Rocket Systems&lt;br /&gt;Design, build, and test altitude compensating rocket systems
  or sub-systems designed to operate the rocket efficiently across a wide range of
  altitudes. &amp;nbsp;Subsystems such as Altitude Compensating Nozzles are being
  considered.&lt;br /&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Aero Gravity Assist Systems&lt;br
  /&gt;Design, build, and test an Aerogravity assist system which uses a close approach
  to the planet, dipping into the atmosphere, so the spacecraft can also use aerodynamic
  lift to further curve the trajectory.&lt;br /&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Launch
  Vehicle and Spacecraft Adaptive Controls&lt;br /&gt;Develop and test adaptive controls
  architectures speci?cally tailored for application to launch vehicles. &amp;nbsp;Adaptive
  Controls for launch vehicles would include unique features of the &amp;nbsp;aerospace
  vehicle, such as control-structure interaction, propellant slosh, sensor performance,
  and actuator dynamics. &amp;nbsp;In addition, the analysis, veri?cation, and ?ight
  certi?cation framework for the control system must be addressed.&lt;br /&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;Autonomous Systems&lt;br /&gt;AFRC is exploring concepts for advanced
  autonomous systems and collaborative autonomous operations that could be applied
  across aerospace vehicles to enhance effectiveness, survivability, and affordability.&lt;br
  /&gt;6.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Autonomy in a Safety Critical Framework&lt;br
  /&gt;Armstrong Flight Research Center is interested in the flight demonstration
  of high level autonomy in a safety critical framework with applicability to man-rated
  air and space vehicles. &amp;nbsp;This high level of autonomy is enabled through
  the use of multiple sensor platforms and algorithms with high computational demands.
  &amp;nbsp;Increased computational capability through embedded high performance computing
  and implementation of resource efficient algorithms is needed to support this integration.
  &amp;nbsp;Research into embedded high performance computing using multi-core processors,
  FPGA, GPU, DSP and associated development of toolchains and algorithms targeted
  to these platforms is needed in order to reduce the Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP)
  of the flight vehicles..&lt;br /&gt;7.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Space Weather
  Systems&lt;br /&gt;Design, develop, and test measurement systems to provide the
  capability for on-demand, validated, and archived radiation measurements related
  to human tissue and avionics silicon upset concerns.&lt;br /&gt;8.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;Electromagnetically Boosted Rockets&lt;br /&gt;One possible solution is
  to use an electromagnetic linear motor boost system to supplement the use of first
  stage booster rockets and rocket clusters. China Lake is currently advocating to
  NAVAIR to initiate a study of long term capital costs and recurring system operational
  costs of the use of an electromagnetic linear motor booster system for their rocket
  sled tracks as compared to the long term operational system costs of moving to a
  newer line of booster rocket production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
