    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    State University (USU) propose to develop technology for lightweight composite materials
    for use in composite structures suitable for both cryogenic and damage tolerant
    environments. The proposed effort will incorporate previous work performed by HEI
    in the cryogenic performance of composite materials as well as previously developed
    improved impact technologies for micro-meteor/space debris survivability.  The application
    of filament wound composite pressure vessels in pressurized storage tanks at cryogenic
    temperatures has been undertaken at HEI and NASA MSFC with promising results.  Likewise,
    HEI has been conducting research and has patented, jointly with NASA MSFC, a robust
    impact resistant composite pressure vessel technology.  This technology shows great
    promise in its resistance to performance degradation from impacts, such as those
    that might be experienced in the space environment in the form of micrometeoroids
    and space debris.  Both of these technologies have been characterized for lightweight
    composite pressure vessels separately.  However, little if any understanding currently
    exists of their combined potential for both cryogenic and impact resistant composite
    structures applications, of those including, composite overwrap pressure vessels
    (COPV's).  The combination of the foregoing cryogenic technology with an impact
    resistant, robust composite pressure vessel technology would be studied.  Further,
    we believe, that combining these two technologies will provide a baseline technology
    from which to develop a dual-use composite structure.  This would be to ensure the
    integrity of the light weight composite structures, such as cryogenic fuel is stored
    in an orbiting depot, when exposed to the harsh environment a spacecraft will be
    expected to encounter during the life of its mission.",nt"owner_org": "d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed",nt"extras":
