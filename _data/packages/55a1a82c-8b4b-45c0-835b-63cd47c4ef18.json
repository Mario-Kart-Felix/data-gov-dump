	"notes": "Maracel Systems and Software Technologies, LLC proposes a revolutionary Range-Based Auto Focus (RBAF) system that will combine externally input range, such as might be received from a tracking radar or GPS telemetry downlink, with advanced image processing to provide long range optical systems with optimal focus while mitigating distortions due to atmospheric disturbances.  The system will be optimized to focus on moving targets generating potentially high focus dynamics and to focus only on the subject of the imagery ? not background artifacts such as rocket plumes.  The significant implication of this development is a substantial improvement in the quality and quantity of data gathered by optical data acquisition systems.  Through research, empirical trials, and algorithm development, the outcome of the Phase I effort will be a prototype system that demonstrates the improved focus capabilities and commercial viability of the RBAF system.  Phase II development will result in production packages with comprehensive interface documentation for modular components of a complete RBAF system that may be manufactured and integrated with long-range optical systems without further engineering design effort.  This will yield a complete product ready for commercialization that includes production quality technical and user documentation.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
