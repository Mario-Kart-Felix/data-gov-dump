	"notes": "Spring walrus harvest data and biological samples (177 pairs of teeth for aging, corresponding sternal skin/blubber thickness and tusk length measurements for health studies, and tissue samples for contaminant analysis) were collected in Gambell, Alaska from 22 April through 6 June 1981. Analysis of biological samples is in progress. Retrieved harvest consisted of 961 walruses (36% males, 39% females, and 25% calves). An average of 8.3 walruses were retrieved per hunter. Loss rates for animals shot in the water were between 6-18% for animals shot on the ice. Loss rates were highest for males and lowest for calves. Total harvest (including possible sunk and lost) was estimated to be between 1118 and 1301 animals. An estimated average of 55% of the walruses harvested were utilized solely for their ivory and an average of 45% were utilized for other parts along with the ivory. Percent utilization of specific walrus parts varied highly by the type of part but was highest for calves (100%) and lowest for vibrissae (1%). Herd size was found to affect an animal's vulnerability in being-harvested. Animals in herds of 1-2 were most vulnerable (90-100% retrieved). Vulnerability dropped as herd size increased and males (in all male herds) were found to be less vulnerable than females (in female/young herds). Of all factors, wind velocity affected hunting occurrence and success the most, followed by ice conditions, and then by weather (fog, rain, snow). During the migration male walruses predominated to the E and NE of Gambell and to the NW close to the Siberian coastline. Females, sub-adults, and calves predominated to the N and NW (in the middle of Anadyr Strait). The height of the harvest and probably the migration occurred between 12 and 23 May. The ice pack was substantially broken up by this time, allowing hunters better access to walrus and allowing walrus an open path through Bering Strait.",
