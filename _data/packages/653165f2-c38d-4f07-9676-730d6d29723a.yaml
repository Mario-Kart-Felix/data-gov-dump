    to leverage technologies developed by and resident in BT, The University of Texas
    Center for Electromechanics (CEM) and Applied Nanotech Incorporated (ANI) in the
    areas of carbon nanotube composites (CNT) and terrestrial and space-based flywheel
    energy storage systems to address SBIR 2012 subtopic S3.04 Power Electronics and
    Management, and Energy Storage. To provide a near term commercial focus in addition
    to NASA space applications, BT is augmenting this team with Astral Infinity (AI)
    to provide one target application that requires flywheel energy storage systems
    with characteristics that exceed current flywheel systems and exceed lithium battery
    capabilities &amp;#150; a solar powered high altitude long endurance unmanned air
    vehicle. This proposal, focuses on making a major near-term advancement in flywheel
    energy density, with high potential for further longer term advancements, by exploiting
    ANI carbon nanotube expertise and CEM/BT flywheel technology. After having plateaued
    for two decades, there is a good probability of attaining near-term improvement
    of 30&#37;-50&#37; for flywheel rotor specific energy by reinforcing the carbon
    fiber composite matrix material with CNT. Subsequently, there is a potential improvement
    in the medium to longer term of an order of magnitude or more by also replacing
    the current carbon fibers with fibers composed of CNTs. Our program focuses on the
    near-term objective and is a first and appropriate step in the longer term objective.rntrnIn
    particular, for this Phase I project our team will:rn1.Develop a concept design
    for a flywheel rotor that relies on CNT reinforced composite flywheels for a 30&#37;-50&#37;
    increase in  flywheel stored energy per kg to substantially exceed the specific
    energy performance of chemical batteries (e.g., lithium batteries) for most space-based
    and terrestrial applications of a few kW-hrs or more, and rn2.Complete an initial
    round of CNT materials testing to support the design.",nt"license_title": "U.S.

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
