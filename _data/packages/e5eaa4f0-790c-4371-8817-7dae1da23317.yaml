  solar resource potential for Alaska.rnrn_Purpose:_  Provide information on the solar
  resource potential for Alaska. The insolation values represent the average solar
  energy available to a flat plate collector, such as a photovoltaic panel, oriented
  due south at an angle from horizontal equal to the latitude of the collector location.rnrn_Supplemental
  Information:_  This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total
  solar resource averaged over surface cells of approximatley 40 km by 40 km in size.
  This data was developed from the Climatological Solar Radiation (CSR) Model. The
  CSR model was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S.
  Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Maxwell,
  George and Wilcox (1998) and George and Maxwell (1999). This model uses information
  on cloud cover, atmostpheric water vapor and trace gases, and the amount of aerosols
  in the atmosphere to calculate the monthly average daily total insolation (sun and
  sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The cloud cover data used as input to the
  CSR model are an 7-year histogram (1985-1991) of monthly average cloud fraction
  provided for grid cells of approximately 40km x 40km in size. Thus, the spatial
  resolution of the CSR model output is defined by this database. The data are obtained
  from the National Climatic Data Center in Ashville, North Carolina, and were developed
  from the U.S. Air Force Real Time Nephanalysis (RTNEPH) program. Atmospheric water
  vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. The procedures
  for converting the collector at latitude tilt are described in Marion and Wilcox
  (1994). Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate
  the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meterological input
  to the model, since some of the input parameters are not avalible at a 40km resolution.
  As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately
  10% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other
  micoclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within
  a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase
  with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain.
  Units are in watt hours.rnrnOther Citation Details:rnrnGeorge, R, and E. Maxwell,
