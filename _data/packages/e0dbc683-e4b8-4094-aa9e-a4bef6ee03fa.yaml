    understanding of cycles of matter and energy in the Universe, for understanding
    the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and for probing gravity in the extreme
    limit of matter accretion onto a black hole. We propose a program to mature the
    current x-ray microcalorimeter technology, while developing transformational technology
    that will enable megapixel arrays.nnnnX-ray calorimeters based on superconducting
    transition-edge sensors achieve the highest energy resolution of any non-dispersive
    detector technology. The performance of single x-ray calorimeter pixels has reached
    that required for many possible future missions such as IXO, RAM, and Generation-X,
    but further optimization is still useful. In the last years, we have made progress
    in developing techniques to control and engineer the properties of the superconducting
    transition. We propose to continue this single-pixel optimization, and to improve
    both the practical and theoretical understanding of the correlation between alpha,
    beta, and noise to identify favorable regions of parameter space for different instruments.nnnnA
    greater challenge is the development of mature TES x-ray calorimeter arrays with
    a very large number of pixels. Advances in the last several years have been significant.
    We have developed modestly large (256 pixel) x-ray calorimeter arrays with time-division
    SQUID multiplexing, and demonstrated Walsh code-division SQUID multiplexing, which
    has the potential to allow scaling to much larger arrays. Here we propose to extend
    this work, and also to introduce a new code-division SQUID multiplexing circuit
    with extremely compact, low-power elements. Using this approach, it is possible
    for the first time to fit all of the detector biasing and multiplexing elements
    underneath an x-ray absorber, allowing in-focal-plane multiplexing. This approach
    eliminates the requirement to bring leads from each pixel out of the focal plane,
    while reducing the power dissipat",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
