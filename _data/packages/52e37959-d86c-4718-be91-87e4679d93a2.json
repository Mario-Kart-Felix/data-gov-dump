	"notes": "This STTR Phase I project describes the development of a high-performance, robust, portable, and compact laser ultrasonic system for multi-purpose Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE). Laser ultrasonic has now become a valuable tool for on-line inspection, demonstrating its advantages in the steel and aerospace industries. Non-destructive laser ultrasonic inspection equipments use large size laser components.  They are not designed for light-weight, portable and power sensitive applications. Currently, NDE of space transportation vehicles is primarily carried out on the ground, between missions but for future space missions, more inspection will need to be performed in space in order to monitor the aging process of the structure and to insure its integrity.  For inspection during space flight, the NDE equipment must be compact, lightweight, easily operated by human with limited mobility or robot, and exhibits low power consumption. To satisfy these requirements we proposed to develop a laser ultrasonic inspection system integrating an amplitude-modulated continuous wave laser source for high efficiency generation and a multi-channel random-quadrature interferometer for robust and highly sensitive detection. The proposed system takes advantage of fiber technology for both the generation and the detection in order to achieve a compact, portable and versatile inspection system. ",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
