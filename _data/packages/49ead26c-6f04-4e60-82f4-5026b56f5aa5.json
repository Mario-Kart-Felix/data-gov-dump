	"notes": "During each NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer field season, full-resolution video in a ProRes 422 format at a bitrate of 145 Mbps is produced during each deployment of the two-body vehicle deep submergence event using the Okeanos' two-vehicle body system.  These vehicle pairs have changed over the years, beginning in 2010 with the Little Hercules ROV and the Argus camera platform, then in 2011 with the Little Hercules ROV and the Seirios camera sled, and then in 2013 with the Deep Discoverer ROV and the Seirios camera sled. Regardless, however, the very high resolution video equipment has produced a similar format and quality of video. These video are sought after by scientists, scientific program producers and media outlets for their ability to show great detail in close up as well as their broadcast quality.  The OER Data Management Team has implemented a solution that preserves these high volume video data that also allows for discovery and self-service access for public consumption. As a part of shipboard standard operating procedures, the full-resolution video data are compressed into low-resolution (1.5 Mbps) for previewing and web streaming.  Additionally, the video streams (10 Mbps) that are streamed during a dive into distributed Exploration Command Centers are captured for preservation and stewardship.  Finally, video highlights or compilations of video segments into video products are produced and preserved in three resolutions: low (1.5 Mbps), high (5 Mbps), and full (145 Mbps).  All of these video data are preserved in the NOAA CLASS for archiving.  Previewable versions of these video data are stored on spinning disk at the oceanographic archive at the NCEI-MD location.  Metadata are generated for these video data using programmatic means to glean the most annotation available for metadata keywords.  An OER Video Portal front-end to the NCEI-MD Geoportals housing NCEI-MD metadata is used to provide a discovery and access method to these video data.",
