    for the geologic and geomorphologic map of the Drakes Bay and Vicinity map area,
    California. The vector data file is included in "Folds_DrakesBay.zip," which is
    accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/DrakesBay/data_catalog_DrakesBay.html.
    Folds in the Drakes Bay and Vicinity map area are identified on seismic-reflection
    data based on abrupt truncation or warping of reflections and (or) juxtaposition
    of reflection panels with different seismic parameters such as reflection presence,
    amplitude, frequency, geometry, continuity, and vertical sequence. The Point Reyes
    Fault Zone runs through the map area and is an offshore curvilinear reverse fault
    zone with predominantly north-side-up motion (Hoskins and Griffiths, 1971; McCulloch,
    1987; Heck and others, 1990; Stozek, 2012) that likely connects with the western
    San Gregorio fault further to the south (Ryan and others, 2008), making it part
    of the San Andreas Fault System. The Point Reyes Fault Zone is characterized by
    a 5 to 11 km-wide zone of deformation in the shallow subsurface that is associated
    with two main fault structures, the Point Reyes Fault and the western Point Reyes
    Fault. Near the Point Reyes headland, vertical displacement of granitic basement
    across the Point Reyes Fault is at least 1.4 km (McCulloch, 1987). Offshore Double
    Point, vertical displacement on the Point Reyes Fault is difficult to assess because
    subsurface age constraints from nearby wells are lacking, and there are few offset
    horizons across the fault imaged on available seismic data. However, warping and
    folding of Neogene strata are clearly visible on high-resolution seismic data (see
    field activity S-8-09-NC). The western Point Reyes Fault is defined by a broad anticlinal
    structure visible in both industry and high-resolution seismic datasets that exhibits
    that same sense of vergence (north-side-up) as the Point Reyes Fault. Folds were
    primarily mapped by interpretation of seismic reflection profile data (see field
    activity S-8-09-NC). The seismic reflection profiles were collected between 2006
    in 2009. References Cited Heck, R.G., Edwards, E.B., Kronen, J.D., Jr., and Willingham,
