    Council initiated the California Seafloor Mapping Program (CSMP), designed to create
    a comprehensive seafloor map of high-resolution bathymetry, marine benthic habitats,
    and geology within Californiau2019s State Waters. The program supports a large number
    of coastal-zone- and ocean-management issues, including the California Marine Life
    Protection Act (MLPA) (California Department of Fish and Wildlife, 2008), which
    requires information about the distribution of ecosystems as part of the design
    and proposal process for the establishment of Marine Protected Areas. A focus of
    CSMP is to map Californiau2019s State Waters with consistent methods at a consistent
    scale. The CSMP approach is to create highly detailed seafloor maps through collection,
    integration, interpretation, and visualization of swath sonar data (the undersea
    equivalent of satellite remote-sensing data in terrestrial mapping), acoustic backscatter,
    seafloor video, seafloor photography, high-resolution seismic-reflection profiles,
    and bottom-sediment sampling data. The map products display seafloor morphology
    and character, identify potential marine benthic habitats, and illustrate both the
    surficial seafloor geology and shallow (to about 100 m) subsurface geology. It is
    emphasized that the more interpretive habitat and geology data rely on the integration
    of multiple, new high-resolution datasets and that mapping at small scales would
    not be possible without such data. This approach and CSMP planning is based in part
    on recommendations of the Marine Mapping Planning Workshop (Kvitek and others, 2006),
    attended by coastal and marine managers and scientists from around the state. That
    workshop established geographic priorities for a coastal mapping project and identified
    the need for coverage of u201clandsu201d from the shore strand line (defined as
    Mean Higher High Water; MHHW) out to the 3-nautical-mile (5.6-km) limit of Californiau2019s
    State Waters. Unfortunately, surveying the zone from MHHW out to 10-m water depth
    is not consistently possible using ship-based surveying methods, owing to sea state
    (for example, waves, wind, or currents), kelp coverage, and shallow rock outcrops.
    Accordingly, some of the data presented in this series commonly do not cover the
    zone from the shore out to 10-m depth. This data is part of a series of online U.S.
    Geological Survey (USGS) publications, each of which includes several map sheets,
    some explanatory text, and a descriptive pamphlet. Each map sheet is published as
    a PDF file. Geographic information system (GIS) files that contain both ESRI ArcGIS
    raster grids (for example, bathymetry, seafloor character) and geotiffs (for example,
    shaded relief) are also included for each publication. For those who do not own
    the full suite of ESRI GIS and mapping software, the data can be read using ESRI
    ArcReader, a free viewer that is available at http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcreader/index.html
    (last accessed September 20, 2013). The California Seafloor Mapping Program is a
    collaborative venture between numerous different federal and state agencies, academia,
    and the private sector. CSMP partners include the California Coastal Conservancy,
    the California Ocean Protection Council, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife,
    the California Geological Survey, California State University at Monterey Bayu2019s
    Seafloor Mapping Lab, Moss Landing Marine Laboratories Center for Habitat Studies,
    Fugro Pelagos, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration (NOAA, including National Ocean Serviceu2013Office of Coast Surveys,
    National Marine Sanctuaries, and National Marine Fisheries Service), U.S. Army Corps
    of Engineers, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the National Park Service,
    and the U.S. Geological Survey. These web services for the Offshore of Point Reyes
    map area includes data layers that are associated to GIS and map sheets available
    from the USGS CSMP web page at https://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/mapping/csmp/index.html.
    Each published CSMP map area includes a data catalog of geographic information system
    (GIS) files; map sheets that contain explanatory text; and an associated descriptive
    pamphlet. This web service represents the available data layers for this map area.
    Data was combined from different sonar surveys to generate a comprehensive high-resolution
    bathymetry and acoustic-backscatter coverage of the map area. These data reveal
    a range of physiographic including exposed bedrock outcrops, large fields of sand
    waves, as well as many human impacts on the seafloor. To validate geological and
    biological interpretations of the sonar data, the U.S. Geological Survey towed a
    camera sled over specific offshore locations, collecting both video and photographic
    imagery; these u201cground-truthu201d surveying data are available from the CSMP
    Video and Photograph Portal at http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7J1015K. The u201cseafloor
    characteru201d data layer shows classifications of the seafloor on the basis of
    depth, slope, rugosity (ruggedness), and backscatter intensity and which is further
    informed by the ground-truth-survey imagery. The u201cpotential habitatsu201d polygons
    are delineated on the basis of substrate type, geomorphology, seafloor process,
    or other attributes that may provide a habitat for a specific species or assemblage
    of organisms. Representative seismic-reflection profile data from the map area is
    also include and provides information on the subsurface stratigraphy and structure
    of the map area. The distribution and thickness of young sediment (deposited over
    the past about 21,000 years, during the most recent sea-level rise) is interpreted
    on the basis of the seismic-reflection data. The geologic polygons merge onshore
    geologic mapping (compiled from existing maps by the California Geological Survey)
    and new offshore geologic mapping that is based on integration of high-resolution
    bathymetry and backscatter imagery seafloor-sediment and rock samplesdigital camera
    and video imagery, and high-resolution seismic-reflection profiles. The information
    provided by the map sheets, pamphlet, and data catalog has a broad range of applications.
    High-resolution bathymetry, acoustic backscatter, ground-truth-surveying imagery,
    and habitat mapping all contribute to habitat characterization and ecosystem-based
    management by providing essential data for delineation of marine protected areas
    and ecosystem restoration. Many of the maps provide high-resolution baselines that
    will be critical for monitoring environmental change associated with climate change,
    coastal development, or other forcings. High-resolution bathymetry is a critical
    component for modeling coastal flooding caused by storms and tsunamis, as well as
    inundation associated with longer term sea-level rise. Seismic-reflection and bathymetric
    data help characterize earthquake and tsunami sources, critical for natural-hazard
    assessments of coastal zones. Information on sediment distribution and thickness
    is essential to the understanding of local and regional sediment transport, as well
    as the development of regional sediment-management plans. In addition, siting of
    any new offshore infrastructure (for example, pipelines, cables, or renewable-energy
    facilities) will depend on high-resolution mapping. Finally, this mapping will both
    stimulate and enable new scientific research and also raise public awareness of,
    and education about, coastal environments and issues. Web services were created
    using an ArcGIS service definition file. The ArcGIS REST service and OGC WMS service
    include all Offshore of Point Reyes map area data layers. Data layers are symbolized
    as shown on the associated map sheets.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
