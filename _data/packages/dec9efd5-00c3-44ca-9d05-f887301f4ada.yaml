  for Geospatial Attributes of Gages for Evaluating Streamflow, version II, provides
  geospatial data and classifications for 9,322 stream gages maintained by the U.S.
  Geological Survey (USGS). It is an update to the original GAGES, which was published
  as a Data Paper on the journal Ecology's website (Falcone and others, 2010b) in
  2010. The GAGES II dataset consists of gages which have had either 20+ complete
  years (not necessarily continuous) of discharge record since 1950, or are currently
  active, as of water year 2009, and whose watersheds lie within the United States,
  including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Reference gages were identified based
  on indicators that they were the least-disturbed watersheds within the framework
  of broad regions, based on 12 major ecoregions across the United States. Of the
  9,322 total sites, 2,057 are classified as reference, and 7,265 as non-reference.
  Of the 2,057 reference sites, 1,633 have (through 2009) 20+ years of record since
  1950. Some sites have very long flow records: a number of gages have been in continuous
  service since 1900 (at least), and have 110 years of complete record (1900-2009)
  to date. The geospatial data include several hundred watershed characteristics compiled
  from national data sources, including environmental features (e.g. climate u00e2u0080u0093
  including historical precipitation, geology, soils, topography) and anthropogenic
  influences (e.g. land use, road density, presence of dams, canals, or power plants).
  The dataset also includes comments from local USGS Water Science Centers, based
  on Annual Data Reports, pertinent to hydrologic modifications and influences. The
  data posted also include watershed boundaries in GIS format. This overall dataset
  is different in nature to the USGS Hydro-Climatic Data Network (HCDN; Slack and
  Landwehr 1992), whose data evaluation ended with water year 1988. The HCDN identifies
  stream gages which at some point in their history had periods which represented
  natural flow, and the years in which those natural flows occurred were identified
  (i.e. not all HCDN sites were in reference condition even in 1988, for example,
  02353500). The HCDN remains a valuable indication of historic natural streamflow
  data. However, the goal of this dataset was to identify watersheds which currently
  have near-natural flow conditions, and the 2,057 reference sites identified here
  were derived independently of the HCDN. A subset, however, noted in the BasinID
  worksheet as u00e2u0080u009cHCDN-2009u00e2u0080u009d, has been identified as an
  updated list of 743 sites for potential hydro-climatic study. The HCDN-2009 sites
  fulfill all of the following criteria: (a) have 20 years of complete and continuous
  flow record in the last 20 years (water years 1990-2009), and were thus also currently
  active as of 2009, (b) are identified as being in current reference condition according
  to the GAGES-II classification, (c) have less than 5 percent imperviousness as measured
  from the NLCD 2006, and (d) were not eliminated by a review from participating state
  Water Science Center evaluators. The data posted here consist of the following items:-
  This point shapefile, with summary data for the 9,322 gages.- A zip file containing
  basin characteristics, variable definitions, and a more detailed report.- A zip
  file containing shapefiles of basin boundaries, organized by classification and
  aggregated ecoregion.- A zip file containing mainstem stream lines (Arc line coverages)
  for each gage.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\": \"bbox-east-long\",\n\t\t\"value\":

  was based on our semi-quantitative evaluation of the criteria described in the report,
  which included both quantitative and qualitative data. Our classification is intended
  as the best identification of reference-quality sites that we could perform given
  the limitations of national-scale data, and within the context of the regions we
  used. It was believed that the deficiencies of national-scale GIS data, which do
  not capture small diversions, dams or groundwater pumping particularly well, would
  be supplemented by an examination of ADR remarks and visual examination of every
  watershed from high-resolution imagery. It is possible that users with localized
  knowledge may be able to perform a better classification for specific areas. Users
  of these data should be attentive to potential differences between reference and
  non-reference gages - for example, watershed size (median size of reference gages
  = 212 sq km; of non-reference gages = 587 sq km). We also note that it would be
  possible to use the data posted here to identify a different, but equally valid,
  set of reference-quality stream gages for other purposes, based on other regions,
  or which place greater emphasis on specific anthropogenic activities or variables
  (e.g., urbanization), and that the classification presented here is not intended
