    data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was collected
    by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and
    digitizing or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information.
    This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute
    data. The map data are in a 7.5 minute quadrangle format and include a detailed,
    field verified inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that normally occur in a repeatable
    pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown a the scale mapped.
    The soil map units are linked to attributes in the Map Unit Interpretations Record
    relational data base, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils
