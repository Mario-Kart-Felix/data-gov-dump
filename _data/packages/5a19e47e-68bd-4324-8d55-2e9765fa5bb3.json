	"notes": "For space-born energy storage systems, the energy to weight ratio is extremely important. From this perspective, a hubless flywheel energy storage design is very advantageous since most of the flywheel energy is stored in its outer circumference, while the core significantly adds to the system weight. One of the problems with this design is that conventional active magnetic bearings are difficult to integrate into the overall system. We propose to utilize recently developed Null-E Magnetic Bearings instead, which appear to be better suited for the hubless topology.  Their major advantages over active magnetic bearings include inherent stability at high rotational speeds, simplicity, low cost and lack of laminated components. At the same time, Null-E bearings deliver the desired combination of high load capacity, stiffness and low rotational losses. They can be designed to operate as entirely passive systems with no electronics or external power supplies, or as partially active systems, with some supplementary electronics. A combination of different modes is also possible, e.g. an active system at low speeds and passive at high.  The proposed study includes electromagnetic design and analysis of Null-E bearings as well as research of composite material technologies suitable for the proposed design. ",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
