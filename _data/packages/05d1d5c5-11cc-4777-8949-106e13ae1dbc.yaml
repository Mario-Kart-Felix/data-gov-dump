    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    instrument devoted tonthe measurement of ocean color and flown on a spacecraft.
    Although other instrumentsnflown on other spacecraft had sensed ocean color, their
    spectral bands, spatialnresolution and dynamic range were optimized for land or
    meteorological use and hadnlimited sensitivity in this area, whereas in CZCS, every
    parameter was optimized fornuse over water to the exclusion of any other type of
    sensing. CZCS had six spectralnbands, four of which were used primarily for ocean
    color. These were of a 20 nanometernbandwidth centered at 443, 520, 550, and 670
    nm. Band 5 had a 100 nm bandwidth centerednat 750 nm and a dynamic range more suited
    to land. Band 6 operated in the 10.5 to 12.5nmicrometer region and sensed emitted
    thermal radiance for derivation of equivalentnblack body temperature. (This thermal
    band failed within the first year of the mission,nand so was not used in the global
    processing effort.) Bands 1-4 were preset to viewnwater only and saturated when
    the IFOV was over most types of land surfaces, or clouds.",nt"owner_org": "d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed",nt"extras":
