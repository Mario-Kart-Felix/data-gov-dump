  Program (CRCP) long-term goals for sustainable management and conservation of coral
  reef ecosystems, towed-diver surveys (aka. towboard surveys) were conducted by the
  Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science
  Center (PIFSC) as part of biennial Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program
  (RAMP) Cruises. 19 towboard surveys (36.3596 km in length), were conducted at Wake
  Island during the Pacific Remote Island Areas RAMP Cruise OES0513 from 12 October
  - 30 October 2005. Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description
  of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied
  reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and
  abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for assessing
  trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic
  diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a
  depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat,
  and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the
  lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either
  side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to
  the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital
  video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover
  of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses
  a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea
  urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera
  which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent
  cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped
  with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals.
  Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using
  a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm
  is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the
  reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on
  the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the
  depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. This metadata applies
  to the benthic characterization observations.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819\",\n\t\"extras\":
