    increases, the need for new materials that are capable of higher operating temperatures,
    such as ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), is critical for turbine hot-section static
    and rotating components. Such advanced materials have demonstrated the promise to
    significantly increase the engine temperature capability relative to conventional
    super alloy metallic blades. They also show the potential to enable longer life,
    reduced emissions, growth margin, reduced weight and increased performance relative
    to super alloy blade materials.rnrnMR&amp;D is proposed a program focused on improving
    the impact resistance of CMCs using 3D woven reinforcement. This approach was shown
    in the Phase I program to hold promise for increased performance is of specific
    interest to Rolls Royce as a candidate material for vanes and blades in their turbine
    engines. MR&amp;D will expand the capability of its analysis tool which was developed
    during the Phase I program by incorporating failure criteria tailored for 3D woven
    preforms as well as executing analyses to predict the exact locations of the fiber
    tows after weaving. rnrnAlong with impact testing, an expansive testing program
    to characterize multiple 3D fiber architectures will be executed. The impact testing
    and associated non-destructive evaluation will be conducted at the University of
    Akron using state-of-the-art techniques to record the damage caused by the projectile
    in real time as well as detailed post-test evaluation. Material characterization
    tests will be conducted at Southern Research Institute and The Ohio State University.
    All of the data resulting from this extensive test program will enhance the analytical
    tools accuracy and utility.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
