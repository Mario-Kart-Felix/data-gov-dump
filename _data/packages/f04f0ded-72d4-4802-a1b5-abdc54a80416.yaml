  files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information
  from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File /n          Topologically Integrated
  Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents
  a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Linen
  \         shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they
  can be combined to cover the entire nation.n          n          ZIP Code Tabulation
  Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS)
  ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data
  for each decennialn          census. The Census Bureau delineates ZCTA boundaries
  for the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the
  Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands once eachn          decade
  following the decennial census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the
  official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP
  Codes to support more efficient mailn          delivery.n          n          The
  Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation
  blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for
  the addresses contained withinn          that block. The most frequently occurring
  ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA. These codes may contain
  leading zeros.n          n          Blocks that do not contain addresses but are
  surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because
  the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code ton          assign
  blocks, a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have
  a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP
  Code or the ZIP Code was not then          most frequently occurring ZIP Code within
  any of the blocks where it exists.n          n          The ZCTA boundaries in this
  release are those delineated following the 2010 Census.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
