    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;Engine testing at NASA SSC poses
    a significant risk to general aviation due to potential smoke and excessive turbulence.
    The airspace over Stennis has been designated as restricted from 0600 - 2300 at
    altitudes below 5000 feet. SSC has limited ability to detect aircraft that have
    breeched the restricted airspace. In order to protect lives and property, a systematic
    evaluation of the potential technologies was requested to identify and define options
    to monitor the airspace, warn aircraft of impending danger, warn NASA test operations,
    and if necessary provide NASA test operations data so that an informed, timely decision
    could be made on whether or not to interrupt engine tests. This project systematically
    evaluated potential technologies that could address the problem of unauthorized
    aircraft entering Restricted Airspace/R-4403; a primary focus of this activity was
    on protecting the SSC Fee and Buffer Zone during an engine test or other sensitive
    operation. The research began with the findings and technology identified in the
    SSC Facility Safety Assessment Report. In 2010, a Facility Safety Assessment was
    performed for SMA to identify hazards associated with the SSC multiuser test range.
    During this assessment, a top system level safety hazard concerning unauthorized
    aircraft entering the SSC Restricted Airspace during test range operations, as well
    as twelve other hazards that directly or indirectly relate to the top hazard, were
    identified. SSC has limited ability to detect aircraft that may have intentionally
    or unintentionally breached R-4403. Because the restricted airspace is controlled
    by Houston ARTCC, controllers at Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport (GPT) and
    Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport (MSY) are not required to monitor
    or alert aircraft to avoid R-4403.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the project
    was to evaluate monitoring techniques to address the problem of aircraft entering
    R-4403, primarily focusing on access to the SSC Buffer Zone during an engine test
    or other sensitive operation. The objective was to provide a small set of cost effective
    solutions that enable appropriate personnel to make informed safety decisions in
    near-real time. A number of different existing and prototype technologies were considered
    against the monitoring requirements defined by NASA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this
    project, several different types of aircraft monitoring technologies were investigated.
    The project intended to prototype these potential technology solutions based on
    information and assessments performed. Potential software approaches to be prototyped
    included: phone apps, e-mail alerts, and desk top displays. Each was assessed against
    NASA&amp;rsquo;s airspace monitoring requirements, which included the ability to
    monitor the entire buffer zone plus an additional 5 mile radius for both transponder
    and non-transponder equipped aircraft and, if possible, low-altitude UASs. Some
    technologies were eliminated because they are unable to track non-transponder equipped
    aircraft, while others are not capable of operating in all weather and illumination
    conditions. The remaining technologies represent potential solutions to monitoring
    the restricted airspace at SSC.&amp;nbsp;Ultimately, the technologies investigated
    were not required and a refined notification procedure to follow in advance of test
    operations was implemented to insure NASA SSC Range Safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
