	"notes": "In two riparian habitat workshops held between 2001 and 2002, scientists and managers identified the need for determining the scope of a consistent and acceptable approach to classifying and mapping riparian habitat as the next step in developing a statewide riparian habitat map. The workshop included 26 specialists in vegetation classification and mapping. Several general conclusions emerged. Because there is such a diverse array of riparian vegetation associations across the state, any type of common approach or standards to classifying riparian habitat would need to be applied at a regional, watershed or habitat level. At the statewide level, riparian habitat may not need to be classified floristically at all if the question is simply to answer what is the extent of riparian areas in California, what general condition they are in, or what kinds of restoration constraints there may be. In 2003, a parallel effort focused on statewide wetlands mapping based on the modified National Wetlands Inventory framework. The wetlands mapping effort currently underway recognized efficiencies in remote imagery interpretation and field verification efforts between wetlands and riparian habitat mapping. As one of the deliverables in prepraration for the third riparian workshop, a 'footprint' map of already completed mapping efforts was prepared, including associated metadata for eventual comparisons of different classification and delineation approaches.",
