    coverage with similar historic datasets, we flew 32 east-west-oriented uniform transects
    (spaced at 15' latitude [27.8-km] intervals) when possible to the 2000-m isobath
    (includes shelf, slope, and rise waters). At the request of BOEM, we included six
    focal-area surveys nested within the overall broad transect survey area. Each focal-area
    survey consisted of ten 25-km, parallel transect lines targeting shelf waters and
    spaced at 6-km intervals. This pattern (broad survey lines and Focal Area survey
    lines) was surveyed during each oceanographic season: summer (June-July), fall (September-October),
    and winter (January-February) during 2011 and 2012. Aerial survey methods follow
    Mason et al. (2007) with slight modifications. Specifically, we recorded all sightings
    of marine animals, vessels, and floating objects from twin-engine, high wing aircraft
    (Partenavia P-68, Aspen Helicopters, Oxnard, CA, or Commander AC-500, GoldAero,
    Arlington, WA) along pre-determined 150-m (75 m per side) strip transects at 60-m
    above sea level. Surveys were flown at 160 km h-1, and we used a Global Positioning
    System (GPS) unit linked to a laptop computer that allowed us to simultaneously
    collect coordinates (WGS-84 map datum), sea surface temperature (SST, degrees Celcius
    [u00c2u00b0C]) determined via a belly-mounted pyrometer, and ocean color data via
    an onboard radiometer (see Remote sensing methods).We maintained the same two trained
    observers throughout the study. During individual surveys, observers frequently
    verified strip widths using hand-held clinometers. Observations generally were discontinued
    when glare exceeded &gt;25% of the field-of-view or if sea state exceeded Beaufort
    5 (29-38 km h-1wind speed). Observations were recorded into hand-held digital audio
    recorders. The third (non-dedicated) observer assisted the pilot with navigation,
    monitored sensor data, and maintained the onboard computer. Observations of species
    or individuals identified to nearest taxon included number of individuals, time,
    pre-coded behaviors, flight direction, and interspecies or vessel associations.
    Digital recordings of observations were archived and used by observers after surveys
    to enter data into a customized Graphical User Interface in ACCESS (Microsoft).
    Observation data were proofed after transcription to ensure accuracy or to resolve
    inconsistencies. Species observations were linked with GPS-based tracklines generated
    at 1 to 3 second intervals. Based on variations in the lag-time between sightings
    and recordings, we estimate that observations have a nominal along-trackline spatial
    accuracy of 222 m, based on a five-second lag at 160 km hr-1survey speed.This file
    geodatabase table contains the raw observation data from the aerial surveys. This
    data includes date and time (DATETIME), latitude and longitude, observer name, species
    code, common and scientific name, the abundance (COUNT), the species behavior and
    association (CODE1-4), the sea state condition (BEAUFORT), the sea surface temperature
    (SST), a unique ID (NewID_Num) and the animal type.References:Bonnel, M.L., C.E.
