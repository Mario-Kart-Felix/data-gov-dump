	"notes": "Propagation of parameter uncertainties through large computer models can be very resource intensive. Frameworks and tools for uncertainty quantification are generally geared to individual codes, are research codes, or are single-purpose tools such as LHS matrix generators. The Reduced-Order-Clustering-Uncertainty-Quantification (ROCUQ) methodology discussed in this proposal is specifically designed to circumvent many of the issues associated with uncertainty quantification of large simulation codes. The ROCUQ methodology has been applied in several different physical disciplines with good results. The computational methodology is a combination of reduced-order modeling, stratified sampling (Latin Hypercube Sampling ? LHS), statistical clustering of results (K-means clustering) and a few (five to ten) full-physics runs of the high-fidelity model under investigation. The method should be applicable to hundreds of uncertain variables when required. ROCUQ enables estimates of system response quantities (SRQ) uncertainty distributions for situations where it is not feasible to use purely sampling, collocation, or other techniques where many runs would be required. For some organizations, uncertainty analysis has never been possible due to resource limitations, and thus is not part of the organizational culture. Many analysts know that uncertainties can be important, but have no way to expend sufficient resources (money, CPU cycles, time) to do the work needed to quantify uncertainties. A methodology such as ROCUQ promises to open doors in organizations that know that they have the need, and may now be able to actually perform the analyses. Successful completion of the Phase II project will produce not only new software that will be able to be used by researchers and industry, but will assemble insights on the use of reduced order models in a variety of disciplines, and provide guidance and rules for the use of ROCUQ for the estimation of SRQ uncertainty distributions.",

What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
