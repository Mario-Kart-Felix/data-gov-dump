    was developed to provide summary information on sensitive natural and human-use
    resources for the purposes of oil spill planning, environmental assessment, and
    natural resource management. Although the G-WIS database should be a valuable planning
    and resource management tool, it should not be used to the exclusion of other pertinent
    data or information held by state or federal agencies or other organizations. Likewise,
    information contained in the database cannot be used in place of consultations with
    environmental, natural resource, and cultural resource agencies, or in place of
    field surveys. Also, this database and related map products should not be used for
    navigation. Recognize that the information contained in the G-WIS database represents
    known concentration areas or occurrences of natural, cultural, and human-use resources,
    but does not necessarily represent the full distribution or range of each species
    or resource. This is particularly important to recognize when considering potential
    impacts to protected resources, such as endangered species, wetlands, etc. For more
    information or guidance on proper and improper uses of these data, please contact
