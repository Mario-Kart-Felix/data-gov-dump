    with 30x30 meter cell size representing the slope (in degrees) of the 2003 multibeam
    bathymetry of the Charleston Bump off of the South Atlantic Bight, derived from
    data collected in 2003. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration
    with the College of Charleston, as well as the United States Navy Ship Pathfinder
    (USNS) , and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the
    South Atlantic Bight from 06/14/2003 to 07/6/2003. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted
    Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz). Data has all correctors
    applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water
    (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM Zone
    17 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE
    surface based on swath angle. The CARIS Export option "BASE Surface to Image"
    was then used to create a GeoTiff of the priority areas. Slope was derived from
    this surface using the slope calculator, a function of ESRI Arc10 Spatial Analyst
    Slope tool extension.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
