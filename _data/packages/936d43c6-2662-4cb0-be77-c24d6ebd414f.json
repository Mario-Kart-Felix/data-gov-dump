	"notes": "Mars sample return ascent vehicles require a velocity change exceeding 4 km/s within minutes of launch and higher propellant mass fractions than are offered by current pressure-fed satellite propulsion systems. Pump-fed systems are potentially low-mass, but a suitable high-pressure nitrogen tetroxide/monomethyl hydrazine (NTO/MMH) bipropellant rocket engine remains to be developed. The state of the art in NTO/MMH combustion chambers is iridium-lined rhenium (Ir/Re) manufactured by Ultramet and used by Aerojet in its HiPAT engine. In previous and current work, Ultramet has demonstrated the potential for fabrication of refractory metal and ceramic matrix composite (CMC)-lined carbon/carbon (C/C) components, thereby combining the benefits of the refractory liner with the substantially reduced weight and cost of C/C. The shortfall of using C/C as the lightweight structure is the disparity in thermal expansion, causing highly stressed components. In this project, Ultramet will demonstrate a processing route to integrally bond liners of a zirconium carbide (ZrC) CMC and of rhenium to C/C that will be applied to the fabrication of a Mars sample return ascent engine combustion chamber. Phase II will culminate in the design and fabrication of a 1000-N, 500-psi refractory-lined C/C chamber that will be delivered to NASA. To facilitate testing within project funding resources, a 22-N 500-psi refractory-lined C/C chamber will also be designed, fabricated, and hot-fire tested at one of the major propulsion system integrators (Aerojet, Moog-ISP, or Northrop Grumman), all of which have expressed interest in teaming on the project.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
