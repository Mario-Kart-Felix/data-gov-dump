    Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E) held in Oklahoma were collected
    on May 24, 2011 to support the CHILL radar and the NASA ER-2 instrumentation data.
     The Pawnee is a single polarization (V polarization) Doppler radar which was located
    at approx. azimuth 352 deg / range 48 km with respect to CHILL.  The half-power
    antenna pattern main lobe beamwidth is ~1.8 degrees.  During the ER2 flight, the
    Pawnee conducted a wide azimuth opening PPI sector volume scan oriented towards
    the east designed to provide general 3D coverage of the ER2 flight area.  When the
    ER2 reported starting a course reversal; the CHILL and Pawnee radars attempted to
    start sector scans at the same time to support dual Doppler wind analyses.  In an
    effort to expand the MC3E sampling to a wider geographical area, the NASA ER2 aircraft
    was directed to Northeastern Colorado while widespread rain was in progress on May
    24 2011.  The aircraft flew a series of pre-defined ground tracks that coincided
    with radials from the CSU-CHILL radar.  This aided in keeping the aircraft in the
    plane of a series of RHI scans done by CSU-CHILL.  The single polarization CSU-Pawnee
    radar maintained volume coverage of the echo system while the radial flight legs
    were in progress.  During aircraft course reversals at the ends of the radial legs,
    the CHILL and Pawnee radars started volume scans in synchronization to support dual
    Doppler wind syntheses.  CHILL and Pawnee radar data are available as separate datasets.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
