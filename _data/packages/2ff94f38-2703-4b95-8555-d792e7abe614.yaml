    and below-ground biomass, above- and below-ground NPP (ANPP and BNPP), and total
    NPP(TNPP) for selected North American and Eurasian boreal forests located between
    66.37 degrees N and 47.5 degrees N. Each stand was selected through a review of
    published literature and classified into one of three classes, depending upon completeness
    of NPP budget, ancillary site data, and stand information. Within the overall 1965-1995
    temporal range, data available for individual sites varies widely.There are two
    ASCII files (comma-separated-value format) of NPP data.tThe first file provides
    carbon distribution in above- and below-ground vegetation biomass, above- and below-ground
    net primary production, and mean annual biomass increment for twenty-four (24) Class
    I sites which have complete NPP budgets (ANPP + BNPP). Information about site characteristics
    and NPP measurement approaches are also provided.tThe second file provides stand
    information, carbon distribution in above-ground vegetation biomass, and ANPP data
    for forty-five (45) Class II boreal forest stands that have incomplete NPP budgets.
    Revision Notes:Above- and below-ground biomass, ANPP, and TNPP values for several
    sites have been corrected to agree with primary published sources and related data
    sets. The temporal coverage for both has been corrected to agree with primary published
    sources. Please see the Data Set Revision section of this document for detailed
    information.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
