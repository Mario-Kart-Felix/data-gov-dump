  survey of branch office deposits for all FDIC-insured institutions including insured
  U.S. branches of foreign banks. Data are as of June 30. Users can access these data
  by(1) single institution, (2) institutions within a geographic area, or (3) aggregated
  within a geographic area. SOD features include custom market share reports and downloads.Linkhttp://www2.fdic.gov/sod/Scope
  of the SurveysTo provide a means for measuring deposits in local banking markets,
  the surveys obtain deposit figures for each banking office of branch banking systems,
  and for each insured U.S. branch of a foreign bank. Deposit figures for unit banks
  (which do not have branch offices) were obtained from the June Reports of Condition.
  Deposit Reporting - Institutions should report their deposits in a manner consistent
  with their existing internal record-keeping practices, however, other methods that
  logically reflect the deposit gathering activity of the bank's branches may be used.
  It is recognized that certain classes of deposits and deposits of certain types
  of customers may be assigned to a single office. Please refer to the reporting instructions
  for more information (see above). Arrangement of Published DataBecause these publications
  are used as a source of market share information for individual banking markets,
  the figures for each geographical area only include deposits of offices located
  within that area. Several institutions have designated home offices that do not
  accept deposits; these have been included in the survey to provide a more complete
  listing of all offices. Additional points that should be noted1. With the exception
  noted above, 'banking office' is defined to include all offices and facilities that
  actually hold deposits, and does not include loan production offices, computer centers,
  and other nondeposit installations, such as automated teller machines (ATMs). 2.
  Institutions are allowed to combine deposit data from two or more offices within
  the same county for the following office typesdrive-in offices, seasonal branches,
  and military facilities. Where centralized bookkeeping or other conditions make
  it impossible to report exact figures, estimates are required. 3. International
  Banking Facility (IBF) deposits are considered deposits in foreign offices and are
  not included in the Summary of Deposits Survey. 4. Offices and deposits are reported
  by the institution that owned the office as of the close of business on June 30.
  5. The term 'offices' includes both main offices and branches. An institution with
  four branches operates a total of five offices. 6. All reports submitted to the
  FDIC and the OTS have been validated and corrected to the extent possible. There
  may be rounding differences or minor reporting errors reflected in the tables. 7.
  Savings Institutions include all FDIC-Insured financial institutions that operate
  under federal or state thrift banking charters. Prior to August 9, 1989, all institutions
  insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) and all savings
  banks insured by the FDIC are included in any applicable chart.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
