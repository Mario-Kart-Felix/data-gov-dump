    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "A spacecraft thermal control system must
    keep the vehicle, avionics and atmosphere (if crewed) within a defined temperature
    range. Since water is non-toxic and good for heat transport, it is typically used
    as the coolant that circulates within the crew cabin boundary. This loop then interfaces
    with another low freeze point fluid, such as ammonia, for transport of heat to a
    radiator where the temperatures can be considerably below the freezing point of
    water.  The volumetric expansion during freeze usually prevents its use in external
    systems since freezing will damage the components. Yet, if the system can accommodate
    the forces generated by freezing, then selectively allowing parts of a heat exchanger
    to freeze can be used to passively increase the turn-down of the heat rejection
    from radiators.  TDA Research, Inc. has been developing freezable water/ice phase
    change heat exchangers for several years that offer several advantages: they can
    eliminate the need for a separate heavy Freon or ammonia loop; use the buildup of
    ice to regulate the rate of heat transfer, and the endotherm of melting ice can
    absorb peak loads from the spacecraft to reduce the size and mass of the radiator.
     Therefore, TDA Research and the University of Colorado set out to demonstrate
    a lightweight and freeze tolerant water/ice heat exchanger to passively regulate
    the heat rejection rate from the water coolant loop of a manned spacecraft to its
    heat sink systems. The heat exchanger has no actively moving parts and is thus extremely
    reliable. In Phase I, we designed and built a self-regulating freezable heat exchanger
    that we put through 191 freeze/thaw cycles without damage and it has the capability
    to transfer the loads expected in crewed spacecraft.  In Phase II, we will design,
    build and test a large-scale freeze tolerant water/ice heat exchanger that forms
    the heart of a thermal control system that we will deliver to NASA.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
