	"notes": "The Form EIA-860 is a generator-level rnsurvey that collects specific information about existing and planned rngenerators and associated environmental equipment at electric power rnplants with 1 megawatt or greater of combined nameplate capacity. The rnsurvey data is summarized in reports such as the [Electric Power Annual](http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/epa_sum.html). The survey data is also available for download here.rnrn   The data are compressed into a rnself-extracting (.exe) zip folder containing .XLS data files and record rnlayouts. The current file structure (starting with 2009 data) consists rnof a record layout, 8 data files and a copy of the applicable version ofrn the Form EIA-860 on which the data was collected.rnrnThe record layout provides a rndirectory of all (published) data elements collected on the Form EIA-860rn together with the related description, specific file location(s), and, rnwhere appropriate, explanation of codes. The data files consist of the rnfollowing (substitute the applicable year for "yy" in the file name):rn   rn UtylityY*yy* - Contains respondent contact information and utility-level data for the surveyed generators.rnrnPlantY*yy* - Contains plant-level data for the surveyed generators.rnrnGeneratorY*yy* - Contains generator-level data for the surveyed generators, split into rnthree tabs. The "Exist" tab includes those generators which are rncurrently operating, out of service or on standby; the "Prop" tab rnincludes those generators which are planned and not yet in operation; rnand the "Ret_IP" tab includes those generators which were cancelled rnprior to completion and operation and retired generators at existing rnplants (does not include data for retired generators at plants at which rnall generators have been retired).rnrnOwnerY*yy* - Contains data on the owner and/or operator of the surveyed generators.rnrnMultiFuelY*yy* - Contains data on fuel-switching and the use of multiple fuels by rnsurveyed generators, split into three tabs: "Exist," "Prop," and rn"Ret_IP." See GeneratorsYyy above for a description of the tabs.rnrnInterconnectY*yy* - Contains interconnection data for the surveyed generators.rnrnEnviroAssocY*yy* - Contains boiler association data for the environmental equipment data rncollected on the Form EIA-860. The "Boiler_Gen" identifies which boilersrn are associated with each generator; the "Boiler_Cool" tab shows which rncooling systems are associated with each boiler; the "Boiler_FGD" tab rnshows which flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems are associated with rneach boiler; the "Boiler_FGP" tab shows which flue gas particulate (FGP)rn collectors are associated with each boiler; and the "Boiler_SF" tab rnshows which stacks and flues are associated with each boiler.rnrnEnviroEquipY*yy* - Contains environmental equipment data for the surveyed generators. The rn"Boiler" tab collects boiler data as collected on Schedule 6, Parts B, rnand C of the Form EIA-860; "Control" tab contains emission data as rncollected on Schedule 6, Parts D and E; the "Cooling" tab collects rncooling system data as collected on Schedule 6, Part F; the "FGD" tab rncollects FGD data as collected on Schedule 6, Part H; the "FGP" tab rncollects FGP data as collected on Schedule 6, Part G; and the rn"StackFlue" tab collects stack and flue data as collected on Schedule 6,rn Part I.rnrn**EIA Contact**: Vlad Dorjets, phone: 202-586-3141, e-mail: [Vlad Dorjets](mailto:Vlad.Dorjets@eia.gov)",
