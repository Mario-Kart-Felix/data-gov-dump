    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "OSI proposes to develop a wake vortex detection
    system including a group of double-ended and single-ended optical scintillometers
    properly deployed in the airfield to measure ground and near ground crosswind, turbulence,
    and wake vortex using atmospheric turbulence-induced optical scintillations. As
    part of efforts, OSI also proposes to develop a single-ended optical scintillometer,
    together with a retro-reflector, for the measurement of near ground real-time crosswind
    and wake vortex. OSI will perform system analysis and design of the proposed system
    to detect occurrences, location, magnitude, and persistence of wake turbulence.
    With the simultaneous measurements of crosswind and turbulence, the sensor system
    is also able to forecast the arrival time of the airplane generated wake vortex
    drifting to a nearby runway.rnrnIn the Phase I effort, OSI will determine the optimum
    siting criteria of deploying the double-ended and single-ended sensors on the airport.
    This includes combinations of parallel to runway, cross the runway, and retro-reflector
    on high towers installations. The goal is to form a network of sensors to cover
    essential areas of airport field to provide wake vortex data for the predictive
    modeling of wake vortex hazard. rnrnAs a side benefit, the vortex detection system
    could measure downdraft by deploying two sets of scintillometers on both sides of
    the runway. The line-averaged crosswind measured by the two sets will provide real-time
    continuous measurements of convergence and divergence of the wind field between
    the two optical paths. Vertical winds, and hence the downdraft, can be derived from
    the measured divergence. The proposed vortex detection system will also be able
    to provide critical large area wind information. By incorporating this valuable
    information into the low-level wind shear modeling, it will greatly enhance the
    performance of the present airport low-level wind shear systems.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
