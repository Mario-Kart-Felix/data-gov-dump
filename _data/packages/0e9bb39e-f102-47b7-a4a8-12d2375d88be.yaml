    uses laser light to detect, range, or identify remote objects based on light reflected
    by the object or emitted through it subsequent fluorescence. Airborne ranging lidar
    is now being applied in coastal environments to produce accurate, cost-efficient
    elevation datasets with high data density. The USGS in cooperation with NASA and
    NPS is using airborne lidar to measure the submerged topography of the Dry Tortugas
    reef tract and Subaerail topography of land features; secondarily, the data will
    be assessed for its potential in terms of benthic characterization. Elevation measurements
    were collected over Dry Tortugas National Park using the NASA Experimental Advanced
    Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL), a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an
    aircraft to measure subaerial and submarine coastal topography. With the NASA EAARL
    lidar system, submarine data is generally acquired to a maximum of approximately
    1.5 secchi depths (a measure of water clarity). The system uses a high frequency
    laser beam directed at the earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the
    aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission
    of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft.
    The Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar, developed by the National Aeronautics
    and Space Administration (NASA) Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) in Virginia, measures
    ground elevation with a vertical resolution of roughly 15 centimeters. A sampling
    rate of up to 3 kHz results in an extremely dense spatial elevation data set. For
    more information on Lidar science and the Experimental Advanced Airborne Research
    Lidar (EAARL) system and surveys, see http://ngom.usgs.gov/dsp/overview/index.php
