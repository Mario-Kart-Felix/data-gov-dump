  conceived as a representation of communities without a municipal sewer system or
  on-site septic systems. The selection of communities was based on criteria established
  by a committee of DNR staff (Brent Parker, Field Office 5, Todd Bishop, GIS Section
  and Scott Vanderhart, Director's Office). The committee decided to look for groups
  of ten houses or more clumped within a 10 acre area which did not fall into an incorporated
  area. The areas that were detected were characterized into 1 of 2 classes: Officially
  Named, Unincorporated Towns (from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)
  shapefile) or Unamed but Developed Rural Subdivisions. To attribute the data, the
  unincorporated GNIS point file was joined with 2000 census data (Population, Median
  House Income, Housing Units, and Occupancy). For the rural subdivisions, polygons
  were digitized around these areas in ArcView 3.2a using 2002 color-infrared aerial
  photography and USGS digital topographic maps (DRGs). A point file was then generated
  using the polygons' centroids and attributed with the number of visible housing
  units observed within the corresponding polygon boundaries. The resulting two point
  files were then merged and the sites were assessed to determine if they had access
  to a wastewater treatment plant. The polygon and point files were both used as an
  initial source of locations for potentially unsewered communities. Digital incorporated
  area files from 1990 census data were used to exclude communities that fell within
  the boundaries of known incorporated areas. The product of this analysis was then
  submitted for review to county sanitarians and rural water entities. After receiving
  their responses, some communities were removed from, and others added to, the initial
  file. The reviewers also added comments in regard to specific communities.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
