  flown in 2012, and photogrammetry of the Middle Fork and Coast Fork of the Willamette

  Feet (NAD83). The vertical datum of the elevation model is NAVD 1988 with units

  Constraints: The estimated inundated areas are based on flows at the Goshen gage
  (USGS 14157500), using the Willamette FIS Hydrology Report (phase one). The hydrology
  of a specific storm will likely be different than presented. This feature should
  never be separated from the feature classes Hi_Res_Extents and Low_Res_Extents,
  which delineate the areas of 1m LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and NED data.
  The area downstream of the confluence with the Middle Fork (forming the mainstem
  Willamette River) is shown in the Middle feature class. Flooding that is not due
  to the Coast Fork, Row or Silk Creek within the reaches shown above is not reflected
  in this feature class. Uncertainties and Limitations for Use of Flood-Inundation
  Maps: Although the flood-inundation maps represent the boundaries of inundated areas
  with a distinct line, some uncertainty is associated with these maps. The flood
  boundaries shown were estimated based on water stages and streamflows at the USGS
  streamflow-gaging station 14157500, Coastal Fork Willamette River Near Goshen, OR.
  Water-surface elevations along the stream reaches were estimated by steady-state
  hydraulic modeling, assuming unobstructed flow, and using streamflows and hydrologic
  conditions anticipated at the USGS streamgage. The hydraulic model reflects the
  land-cover characteristics and any bridge, dam, levee, or other hydraulic structures
  existing as of 2011. Unique meteorological factors (timing and distribution of precipitation)
  may cause actual streamflows along the modeled reach to vary from those assumed
  during a flood, which may lead to deviations in the water-surface elevations and
  inundation boundaries shown. Additional areas may be flooded due to unanticipated
  conditions such as: changes in the streambed elevation or roughness, backwater into
  major tributaries along a main stem river, or backwater from localized debris or
  ice jams. The accuracy of the floodwater extent portrayed on these maps will vary
  with the accuracy of the digital elevation model used to simulate the land surface.
  Additional uncertainties and limitations pertinent to this study may be described
  elsewhere in this report. If this series of flood-inundation maps will be used in
  conjunction with National Weather Service (NWS) river forecasts, the user should
  be aware of additional uncertainties that may be inherent or factored into NWS forecast
  procedures. The NWS uses forecast models to estimate the quantity and timing of
  water flowing through selected stream reaches in the United States. These forecast
  models (1) estimate the amount of runoff generated by precipitation and snowmelt,
  (2) simulate the movement of floodwater as it proceeds downstream, and (3) predict
  the flow and stage (water-surface elevation) for the stream at a given location
  (AHPS forecast point) throughout the forecast period (every 6 hours and 3 to 5 days
  out in many locations). For more information on AHPS forecasts, please see: http://water.weather.gov/ahps/pcpn_and_river_forecasting.pdf.
