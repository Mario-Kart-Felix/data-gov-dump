	"notes": "Various technologies available to space system designers that operate atndifferent voltage levels.  It is, however, important to interface,nmaintain, and update these systems.  For example, the Sun EarthnConnection (SEC) missions are likely to have a variety of experimentsnneeding to be accomplished with a single nanosatellite. A rad-hardnreconfigurable bi-directional level shifters would allow them tonaccomplish this goal despite the various multi-voltage level systemsnemployed within the satellite.  Additionally, a level shifter could benused to extend and/or expand the life of existing space systems.nPresently and in the future, nanosatellites and other spacecraft havenneed for rad-hard reconfigurable bi-directional level shifters to enablenthere existing systems the ability to communicate logic signals to othernlower voltage level systems.  This proposal is to develop such a levelnshifter.   This will allow these systems to continue to conductnoperations and missions for the existing and a growing number of futurenusers.  Space system applications for SEC missions have mass, power,ncost, and rad-hard limitations on all of their circuits.  A rad-hardnreconfigurable bi-directional level shifter design would provide fornthese needs between multilevel voltage technologies to aid in their missions.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
