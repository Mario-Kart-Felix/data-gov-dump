    clapper rail, Rallus longirostris obsoletus. is a species that, until very recently,
    was on the verge of extinction. This secretive marsh bird's decline began over 100
    years ago in the pristine marshes of San Francisco Bay (Bay) and the California
    coast (Fig. 1). In the earlier part of this century, the rail was found as far north
    as Humboldt Bay pd as far south as Morro Bay (Gill 1979) (Fig. 2). In the early
    80s, the last  known pair of rails outside of the Bay was seen at Elkhorn Slough
    in Monterey County. During the first half of this century, exploitation of the Bay's
    natural resources, including unrestricted filling and diking of the tidal marshes,
    began shrinking the rail's habitat in San Pablo Bay, Central and South San Francisco
    Bay from over 51,000 hectares to less than 9,000 hectares that now remain today
    (Dedrick 1993). The cumulative effects from this continued loss of critical  habitat,
    combined with recent threats from increased predation, probable contamination, and
    other stresses associated with expanding urban growth, has created a crisis for
    our bay's indigenous rail. After the rail was listed as Endangered under the authority
    of the Endangered Species Act by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) in
    1970, censuses of the population in the Bay were initiated. In the early 1970s,
    Gill estimated the total California clapper rail population at 4200 to 6000 individuals
    (1979). Surveys for the rail continued into the 80s (Moss 1980), with Harvey providing
    an estimate of 1200-1500 rails in 1981. The survey by Harvey was more accurate than
    the Gill estimate because an actual count was made, as compared to an average density
    which Gill applied to all suitable habitat. Subsequent censuses were sporadic and
    incomplete (Harvey 1987) until the Service, led by the San Francisco Bay National
    Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) began winter high tide surveys of South San Francisco Bay
    (South Bay) in 1988 (Foerster 1989). The Service began to suspect that the rail
    was in serious decline after the Refuge conducted a thorough survey of major South
    Bay marshes in the winter of 1988-89 and estimated a total population of only 700
    rails. It was discovered that populations of rails in marshes on the east side of
    the bay were suffering the greatest declines and that predation by non-native predators
    was implicated as a primary factor (Foerster 1989). This hypothesis was confirmed
    by data collected by the Refuge and subsequently an Environmental Assessment and
    Predator Management Plan was implemented in March 1991 (Foerster and Takekawa 1991).
    Since 1988, the Refuge has continued to conduct annual winter high tide surveys
    of South Bay rail populations and some San Pablo Bay (North Bay) subpopulations
    (Figs. 2 and 3), with the assistance of the California Department of Fish and Game
    (CDFG) and other local organizations such as the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory.
    This report summarizes data collected between November 1989 and January 1993, encompassing
    four annual winter surveys. During the last two years, the Refuge also initiated
    research into several factors which were implicated in rail  population decline.
    The factors which were identified as significantly affecting rail survival included
    predation by non-native predators (Foerster and Takekawa 1991), and high levels
    of heavy metals in prey species (Lonzarich, et al. 1992). Continued analysis of
    these factors by the Service will culminate in a several reports to be released
    in late 1994.",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras":
