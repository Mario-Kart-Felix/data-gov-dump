    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    incurred during vibration testing has been monitored in the prefailure space using
    resistance spectroscopy-based state space vectors, rate of change of the state variable,
    and acceleration of the state variable. The technique is intended for condition
    monitoring in high reliability applications where the knowledge of impending failure
    is critical and the risks in terms of loss of functionality are too high to bear.
    Future state of the system has been estimated based on a second-order Kalman Filter
    model and a Bayesian Framework. The measured state variable has been related to
    the underlying interconnect damage in the form of inelastic strain energy density.
    Performance of the prognostic health management algorithm during the vibration test
    has been quantified using performance evaluation metrics. The method- ology has
    been demonstrated on leadfree area-array electronic assemblies subjected to vibration.
    Model predictions have been correlated with experimental data. The presented approach
    is applicable to functional systems where corner interconnects in area-array packages
    may be often redundant. Prognostic metrics including u03b1 u2212 u03bb precision,
    u03b2 accuracy, and relative accuracy have been used to assess the performance of
    the damage proxies. The presented approach enables the estimation of residual life
    based on level of risk averseness.",nt"owner_org": "d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed",nt"extras":
