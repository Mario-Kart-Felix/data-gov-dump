    Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, from 20110407 to 20110509, reef fish assessment surveys were conducted,
    as a part of Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA), during the Pacific Reef Assessment
    and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruise HA1101 in the Marianas region by the Coral
    Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center
    (PIFSC). During the cruise, 20 REA sites were surveyed at Agrihan in the Marianas
    region. At each REA site, fish biologists entered the water and conducted a fine-scale
    (~700 m^2) and high degree of taxonomic resolution REA survey to assess and monitor
    species diversity, size distribution, and abundance of fish in shallow-water hard-bottom
    (less than 30 m) habitats. Reef fish assessment surveys were focused on cataloging
    the diversity (species richness), abundance (numeric density) and biomass (fish
    mass per unit area) of diurnally active reef fish assemblages. The stationary point
    count (SPC) method was used to quantify reef fish species. Two divers lay out a
    30 m transect line, and position themselves at the 7.5 and 22.5 meter marks. The
    SPC biologist then records estimated size and abundance of all fish within a visually
    estimated 15-m diameter cylinder centered on the stationary diver (7.5-m radius,
    total area ~ 177m^2 per cylinder). The diver first spends 5 minutes identifying
    all fish species in the cylindrical area, then proceeds to count and estimate size
    (total length) for each in a series of "instantaneous" point counts or sweeps
    of the cylinder. Fish were identified at the species level, wherever possible. All
    reef-associated fish, including those in the water column, were surveyed. The survey
    time for each stationary point count survey was approximately 20 min and generally
    four stationary point count surveys (two per diver) were conducted at each fish
    REA site. After completing REA surveys, divers noted the presence, at the survey
    site, of any unusual fish species not counted during SPC counts, in order to facilitate
    species lists per location.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
