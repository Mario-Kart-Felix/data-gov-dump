	"notes": "This paper proposes a physics based degradation modeling and prognostics approach for electrolytic capacitors. Electrolytic capacitors are critical components in electronics systems in aeronautics and other domains. Degradation's in capacitor and MOSFET components are often the cause of failures in DC-DC converters. For example, prevalent fault effects, such as a ripple voltage surge at the power supply output, can damage interconnected critical subsystems leading to cascading fault propagation. Prognostics in general and in this case electronics components in particular is concerned with the prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) of components and systems. It performs a condition-based health assessment by estimating the current state of health. Furthermore, it leverages the knowledge of the device physics and degradation physics to predict remaining useful life as a function of current state of health and anticipated operational and environmental conditions. Physics-based models capture degradation phenomena in terms of component geometry and energy based principles that define the effect of stressors on the component behavior. This is in contrast to the traditional approach for deriving degradation models from empirical data. Implementing the degradation  modeling techniques\r\npresent a general methodology for estimating lifetimes due to specific failure mechanisms. The failure\r\nrate models can be tuned to include parameters that relate to the present health of the device\/system and the\r\nexpected conditions under which it will be operated. The models and algorithms are applied to data from\r\ndegradation experiments of several COTS capacitors. Results show the efficiency of the approach chosen.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
