	"notes": "This image represents an 8 meter resolution backscatter mosaic of a seamount/bank east of Fajardo, Puerto Rico. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in and around the Northeast Reserve from 3/05/2013 to 3/29/2013. Data was acquired with a hull mounted Kongsberg EM1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software, applying all relevant correctors (attitude, sound velocity, absorption coefficient). Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The backscatter component of the bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected in CARIS HIPS Mosaic Editor. Acoustic backscatter mosaics are an important piece of information when characterizing surficial seafloor features and delineating benthic habitats. The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.",
