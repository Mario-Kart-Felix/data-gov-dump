    4200 YrBP. Paleobathymetry estimated at 10-15 m. SST reconstruction is based on
    the analysis of Sr/Ca and U/Ca ratios in corals. For the present study, precision
    on the Sr/Ca paleothermometer was +/- 1.3 deg C, and +/- 0.9 deg C for the U/Ca
    paleothermometer. The data consist of reconstructed Sea Surface Temperatures extrapolated
    from analyses of trace element ratios in a fossil coral head. A date of 4166 +/-
    15 calendar yr BP was obtained by the U/Th series technique for the coral. This
    date corresponds to the cold episode centered around sample #464. A fossil coral
    from Tasmaloum (Vanuatu) was found between 0.80 and 1.20 m depth in drill core 9A,
    collected at an altitude of +4.66 m above sea level. Owing to the calculated uplift
    rate the paleodepth of the Porites can be estimated ~10-15 m. at 4150 years B.P.
    The surrounding coral assemblages indicate an open shallow marine environment. Sr/Ca
    and U/Ca analyses were converted to SST, using the following equations: Sr/Ca (10-3
    M) = 10.73 - 0.0657SST R = 0.79 U/Ca (10-6 M) = 2.106 - 0.0367SST R = 0.89 In greater
    than 98% of the samples analyzed, Sr and U reconstructed SST agree well within error.
    A 47-year-long composite SST curve was then constructed, and monthly SST values
    were extrapolated. File vanuatu.4200bp.SrCaU.txt: Raw Sr/Ca and U/Ca data. - sample
    #1 is the youngest, i.e. the one with an estimated age of 4128 +/- 15 BP. - there
    are some data missing. For U/Ca, it is due to the sample size. When it is too small,
    we cannot measure U accurrately, and although we got U values, they usually have
    a %RSD attached to them which is higher than 1%, and I don't feel they are precise
    enough to be used. For Sr/Ca, we experienced several problems with our machine.
    When the Sr data looked dubious (i.e. when we had poor stability in the in-house
    coral standard we analyze during each run) we re-ran the Sr and Ca analyses. In
    most cases, the two runs agreed within error. When there was a discrepancy between
    the two runs, we ran the samples a third time (when sample size permitted). Missing
    Sr/Ca data are those samples too small to allow for a third run. These are raw data.
    They were then translated into temperature data using the equations presented in
    the article, averaged and resampled at monthly interval using the Analyseries program.",nt"owner_org":
