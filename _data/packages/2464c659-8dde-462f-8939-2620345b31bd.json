	"notes": "This "QUAD12K_LOSCO_2007" ploygon shapefile is a reference index to the polygon footprints of Digital Orthographic Quarter Quadrangles (DOQQs) for Louisiana and a selected surrounding area. The reference information included in the shapefile database includes a variety of different unique LA12K polygon identifiers, references to the DOQQs for the years that DOQQs have been produced for Louisiana, references to the 1:24,000 scale (7.5 Minute) quadrangles that contain the LA12K footprints, references to the 1:62,500 scale (15 Minute) quadrangles that contain the LA12K footprints, references to the 1:100,000 scale quadrangles that contain the LA12K footprints, references to the 1:250,000 scale quadrangles that contain the LA12K footprints, references to the one degree of Latitude by one degree of Longitude blocks that contain the LA12K footprints, an assortment of the basic components that concatenate to produce many of the polygon identifier attributes, along with a number of cross-reference identifiers from various government agencies, along with some appropriate coordinate system references. Please note the following, throughout these metadata records and throughout the GIS data themselves: "12K" (derived from 1:12,000 scale) is used as an abbreviated reference to the DOQQ footprint polygons or occasionally the DOQQs themselves. The "12K" terminology is used for convenience and clarity only! This abbreviation should not be thought of as an accurate reference to scale!",
