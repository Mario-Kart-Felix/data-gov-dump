    proposed management categories within Nevada and California project study boundaries.MANAGEMENT
    CATEGORY DETERMINATION The process for category determination was directed by the
    Nevada Sagebrush Ecosystem Technical team. Sage-grouse habitat was determined from
    a statewide resource selection function model and first categorized into 4 classes:
    high, moderate, low, and non-habitat. The standard deviations (SD) from a normal
    distribution of RSF values created from a set of validation points (10% of the entire
    telemetry dataset) were used to categorize habitat u00e2u0080u0098qualityu00e2u0080u0099
    classes. High quality habitat comprised pixels with RSF values &lt; 0.5 SD, Moderate
    &gt; 0.5 and &lt; 1.0 SD, Low &lt; 1.0 and &gt; 1.5, Non-Habitat &gt; 1.5 SD. Proposed
    Habitat Management Categories were then defined and calculated as follows.1) Core
    habitat: Defined as the intersection between all suitable habitat (high, moderate,
    and low) and the 85% Space Use Index (SUI). 2) Priority habitat: Defined as all
    high quality falling outside the 85% SUI and all non-habitat falling within the
    85% SUI. 3) General habitat: Defined as moderate and low quality habitat falling
    outside the 85% SUI. 4) Non habitat. Defined as non-habitat falling outside the
    85% SUI. SPACE USE INDEX CALCULATIONLek coordinates and associated trend count data
    were obtained from the 2013 Nevada Sage-grouse Lek Database compiled by the Nevada
    Department of Wildlife (NDOW, S. Espinosa, 9/10/2013). We queried the database for
    leks with a u00e2u0080u0098LEKSTATUSu00e2u0080u0099 field classified as u00e2u0080u0098Activeu00e2u0080u0099
    or u00e2u0080u0098Pendingu00e2u0080u0099. Active leks comprised leks with breeding
    males observed within the last 5 years. Pending leks comprised leks without consistent
    breeding activity during the prior 3 u00e2u0080u0093 5 surveys or had not been surveyed
    during the past 5 years; these leks typically trended towards u00e2u0080u0098inactiveu00e2u0080u0099.
    A sage-grouse management area (SGMA) was calculated by buffering Population Management
    Units developed by NDOW by 10km. This included leks from the Buffalo-Skedaddle PMU
    that straddles the northeastern California u00e2u0080u0093 Nevada border, but excluded
    leks for the Bi-State Distinct Population Segment. The 5-year average (2009 u00e2u0080u0093
    2013) for the number of males grouse (or unknown gender if males were not identified)
    attending each lek was calculated. The final dataset comprised 907 leks. Utilization
    distributions describing the probability of lek occurrence were calculated using
    fixed kernel density estimators (Silverman 1986) with bandwidths estimated from
    likelihood based cross-validation (CVh) (Horne and Garton 2006). UDs were weighted
    by the 5-year average (2009 u00e2u0080u0093 2013) for the number of males grouse
    (or unknown gender if males were not identified) attending leks. UDs and bandwidths
    were calculated using Geospatial Modelling Environment (Beyer 2012) and the u00e2u0080u0098ksu00e2u0080u0099
    package (Duong 2012) in Program R. Grid cell size was 30m. The resulting raster
    was clipped by the SGMA polygon, and values were re-scaled between zero and one
    by dividing by the maximum pixel value.The non-linear effect of distance to lek
    on the probability of grouse spatial use was estimated using the inverse of the
    utilization distribution curves described by Coates et al. (2013), where essentially
    the highest probability of grouse spatial use occurs near leks and then declines
    precipitously as a non-linear function. Euclidean distance was first calculated
    in ArcGIS, reclassified into 30-m distance bins (ranging from 0 u00e2u0080u0093
    30,000m), and bins reclassified according to the non-linear curve in Coates et al.
    (2013). The resulting raster was clipped by the SGMA polygon, and re-scaled between
    zero and one by dividing by the maximum pixel value.A Spatial Use Index (SUI) was
    calculated taking the average of the lek utilization distribution and non-linear
    distance to lek rasters in ArcGIS, and re-scaled between zero and 1 by dividing
    by the maximum pixel value.The volume of the SUI at cumulative 5% increments (isopleths)
    was extracted in Geospatial Modelling Environment (Beyer 2012) with the command
    u00e2u0080u0098isoplethu00e2u0080u0099. Interior polygons (i.e., donutsu00e2u0080u0099
    &gt; 1.2 km2) representing no probability of use within a larger polygon of use
    were erased from each isopleth. The relationship between percent land area within
    each isopleth and isopleth volume (VanderWal and Rodgers 2012) indicated statistically
    concentrated use at the 70% isopleth. The 85% isopleth, which provided greater spatial
    connectivity and consistency with previously used agency standards (e.g., Doherty
    et al. 2010), was ultimately recommended by the Sagebrush Ecosystem Technical Team.
    The 85% SUI isopleth was clipped by the SGMA clipped by the Nevada state boundary,
    which only included habitat within the state of Nevada.Coates, P.S., Casazza, M.L.,
