    advance the development of biological in situ resource utilization for NASA's space
    exploration programs.  We plan to build a foundation to use synthetic biology to
    engineer microorganisms to extract metals from naturally occurring extraterrestrial
    regolith. rntttttrnWe propose to create a novel growth medium designed to mimic
    the lunar regolith ice discovered at the south pole of the moon by the LCROSS mission.
     We will develop a bioleaching column for this simulant to purify metals for consumable
    production in space.  We will characterize known biomining organisms to leach this
    simulant.  Finally we will study the biochemical processes taking place in the leaching
    of the regolith to be able to improve the metabolism of these organisms in the future.rnrnIn
    addition, will produce a database of organisms involved in biomining on Earth and
    the geologies and substrates that they have been found on.  This database can be
    used as a tool to find undersampled mine sites that may contain novel organisms
    suitable for biomining in space.rnrnWe then plan to develop a conceptual bioreactor
    which is designed to extract metals from regolith in space.  We will perform a trade
    study of the mass, productivity, cost and energy requirements of such a bioreactor.rnrnLater
    phases of the research will involve characterization of the important enzymes involved
    in biomining in key organisms, adding to the limited existing knowledge of these
    pathways and leading to creation of a synthetic biological system for efficiently
    engineering them, which we will use to optimize these organisms for extracting relevant
    substrates in relevant space-settlement-like conditions. This further research will
    also include growth on Mars-like simulant regoliths, as well as improvement of the
    bioreactor model in a series of increasingly durable and realistic prototypes that
    will undergo both physical and functional testing.",nt"license_title": "U.S.

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
