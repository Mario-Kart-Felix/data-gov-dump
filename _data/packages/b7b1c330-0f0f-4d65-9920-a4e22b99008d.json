	"notes": "Photon-X has developed a proprietary EO spatial phase technology that can passively collect 3-D images in real-time using a single camera-based system. This technique provides the capability to sense and understand objects and features within a range of distances from low atmospheric altitudes to space. Feedback from the camera allows the Photon-X system to perform 3-D path planning and trajectory assessment for multiple objects of various sizes and shapes. Spatial phase technology provides scene date that is range independent and angle invariant allowing data of tumbling objects to be collected even in the presence of smoke, clouds, or haze. During Phase I, Photon-X plans to model 3D views of tumbling objects and develop preliminary feature extraction and predictive trajectory and range software tools. These tools will be used to demonstrate proof-of-concept for a single controlled scenario. This initial groundwork will be used in selecting the best design approach for Phase II to meet established system goals. A Phase II system will build on the concepts shown in the Phase I proof-of-concept demonstration. A Phase II system will collect image data and track an object in real-time with collected data stored and processed later for feature extraction and 3D modeling.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
