    meter cell size representing the bathymetry of a portion of the Virgin Passage,
    a selected area of seafloor southwest of St. Thomas, USVI, derived from data collected
    in March and April 2010. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration
    with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners,
    acquired multibeam bathymetry data south of St. Thomas and St. John, USVI, from
    3/18/10 to 4/6/10. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002
    multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) for water depths greater than 75 meters, and with
    a moon pool flange-mounted Reson 7125 multibeam echosounder (dual frequecy, 200/400
    kHz) for water depths of up to 75 meters. It was processed by a NOAA contractor
    using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity)
    and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and
    zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The processed
    CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on CUBE. A BAG file was
    exported from the BASE surface, and converted to a GeoTIFF in ESRI ArcMap 10. The
    project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on
    the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability
    of this data according to their own needs and standards.",nt"license_title":
