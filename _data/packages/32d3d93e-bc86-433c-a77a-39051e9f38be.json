	"notes": "A preliminary fisheries survey conducted in 1997 at Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge indicated that fish from the Refuge contained elevated levels of mercury. Prior to this survey, a contaminants investigation in 1984 indicated that mercury and other metals associated with former gold mining\/processing sites at the Refuge represented potential contaminants of concern to wildlife resources inhabiting the Refuge. In response to this information, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Arlington, Texas Field Office, in conjunction with USFWS personnel from Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge, initiated an investigation in 2000 to determine the extent of metals contamination in fishery resources at the Refuge. To accomplish this, biological samples were collected and analyzed for metallic contaminants believed to be associated with the former gold mining activities. These biological samples consisted of fillet and whole body composite fish samples collected from 12 of the Refuge\u2019s reservoirs, whole body and tissue (brain, liver, and muscle) samples from turtles collected from four of the Refuge\u2019s reservoirs, and a whole body composite frog sample collected from a closed mine site located within the boundaries of the Refuge. The fillet samples were analyzed for total mercury content, while the whole body composite fish samples, the chelonian whole body and tissue samples, and the whole body composite frog sample were analyzed for total aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, and zinc. In addition to the biological samples, 20 sediment\/soil samples were collected from possible contaminant sources located within the Refuge (i.e., former ore processing sites) as well as from likely lotic contributors associated with these sites to identify potential physical pathways for migration of metallic contaminants. As with the biotic samples previously mentioned, these sediment\/soil samples were analyzed for total aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, and zinc content. All analytical data resulting from this study were compared with criteria protective of wildlife and human health as well as with other comparative studies to ascertain the potential ecological and public health impacts of metals contamination at the Refuge.",
