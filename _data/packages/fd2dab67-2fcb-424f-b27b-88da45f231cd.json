	"notes": "The Light Microscopy Module (LMM), developed and managed by NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC), is producing fascinating results. LMM will yield even more astonishing results with the addition of enhancing subsystems. Techshot is developing one such subsystem, the LMM-Dynamic Stage (LMM-DS), which will satisfy a host of new experiments. However, GRC has many more researchers awaiting enhancing subsystems for conducting experiments that could lead to new materials with significant commercial potential. Capitalizing on Techshot's rapid progress with the LMM-DS, its vast array of mixing and separations technologies, and its experience with microfluidic systems, Techshot proposes development of a Finite Internal Temperature Slide (FITS)&amp;#151; a hollow microscope slide capable of taking temperature measurements of a sample along the length of a slide without significant optical interference. Additionally this technology will apply heating to the sample by passing a current through the resistive path used for temperature measurement. This allows for more accurate, varied and controlled temperature gradients to be applied across a sample volume while maintaining optical clarity. FITS is a direct result of a need expressed by current NASA funded Principal Investigators  who intend to use the LMM for experiments in which temperature, and/or temperature gradients, must be precisely controlled.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
