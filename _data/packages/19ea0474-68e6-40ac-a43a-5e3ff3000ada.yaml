    backscatter mosaic of the southern coast of Isla de Mona, collected using a Kongsberg
    EM 1002 (95 kHz) multibeam echosounder.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team,
    in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private
    sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the U.S. Caribbean from 4/14/07
    to 4/24/07. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam
    echosounder (95 kHz) and with a moon pool-mounted Reson 8124 multibeam echosounder
    (200 kHz). It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data
    has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean
    lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM
    zone 19 north, datum NAD83. The backscatter component of the bathymetry data were
    geometrically and radiometrically corrected using Geocoder 3.0 software. Acoustic
    backscatter mosaics are ostensibly an important piece of information when characterizing
    surficial seafloor features and delineating benthic habitats.The project was conducted
    to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependent on the project area and
    depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according
    to their own needs and standards.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
