  (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japan satellite mission to monitor tropical and subtropical
  precipitation and to estimate its associated latent heating.  TRMM was successfully
  launched on November 27, at 4:27 PM (EST) from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan.
  \ The precipitation-relevant instruments on the TRMM satellite include the Precipitation
  Radar (PR), an electronically scanning radar operating at 13.8 GHz; TRMM Microwave
  Image (TMI), a nine-channel passive microwave radiometer; and Visible and Infrared
  Scanner (VIRS), a five-channel visible/infrared radiometer.nnThe purpose of the
  3B42 algorithm is to produce TRMM- and raingauge-adjusted multi-satellite precipitation
  rate (in mm/hr) and root-mean-square (RMS) precipitation-error estimates.  The algorithm
  combines multiple independent precipitation estimates from the TMI, Advanced Microwave
  Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing Systems (AMSR-E), Special Sensor Microwave
  Imager (SSMI), Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS), Advanced Microwave
  Sounding Unit (AMSU), Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS), and microwave-adjusted merged
  geo-infrared (IR).  All input microwave data are intercalibrated to TRMM Combined
  Instrument (TCI) precipitation estimates (TRMM product 3B31); the IR estimates are
  computed using monthly matched microwave-IR histogram matching; then missing data
  in individual 3-hourly merged-microwave fields are filled with the IR estimates.
  \ After the preprocessing is complete, the 3-hourly multi-satellite fields are summed
  for the month and combined with the monthly accumulated Global Precipitation Climatology
  Centre (GPCC) rain gauge analysis using inverse-error-variance weighting to form
  a monthly best-estimate precipitation rate, which is TRMM Product 3B43.  The final
  step is to scale all the 3-hourly estimates for the month to sum to the monthly
  value (for each gridbox separately).  The final 3B42 precipitation (innmm/hr) estimates
  have a 3-hourly temporal resolution and a 0.25ufffdx0.25ufffd spatial resolution.
  \ The spatial coverage is the latitude band 50ufffdS to 50ufffdN.nnImportant Changes:
  After the initial Version 7 processing, it was discovered that AMSU data were neglected
  in the first retrospective processing of both the Version 7 TMPA (3B42/43) and TMPA-RT
  (3B40/41/42RT) data series, which created an important shortcoming in the inventory
  of microwave precipitation estimates used during 2000-2010. In addition, a coding
  error in the TMPA-RT replaced the occasional missings in product 3B42RT with zeros.
  Accordingly, both product series were retrospectively processed again. The main
  impact in both series was to improve the fine-scale patterns of precipitation during
  2000-2010 (and for 3B4xRT into late 2012). Averages over progressively larger time/space
  scales should be progressively less affected. [This is the reason the lack of AMSU
  went undiscovered; the merger system copes very reasonably with missing data.] Nonetheless,
  users are urged to switch to the newest Version 7 data sets. The newest runs may
  be identified by the file names: V.7 3B42/43 suffix of \"7A.HDF\" for January 2000
  - September 2010 V.7 3B4xRT suffix of \"7R2.bin\" for 1 March 2000 - 6 November
  2012 It continues to be the case that the Version 7 3B42/43 is some 4% higher than
  the calibrating data set (2B31) over oceans, which is still under study. However,
  the initial conclusion is that it results from the sampling mismatch between the
  (very sparse) TCI and the (much denser) microwave constellation. At the large scales
  this offset seems to be nearly a proportional constant. nnTMPA Restarted with October
  2014: On October 07, 2014, routine production ended for the TRMM PR precipitation
  estimates.  Since PR is no longer available, the TMI/PR combined instrument (TCI)
  estimates are also no longer available.  As products 3B42/3B43 use the TCI estimates
  as the satellite calibrator, September 2014 is the last month these products were
  produced in this way.  In a...\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S. Government Work\",\n\t\"extras\":

  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
