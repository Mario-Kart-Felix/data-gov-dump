    subsystem capable of operation in extreme environments, including those to be encountered
    on the Moon and Mars. Specifically, we will demonstrate operation over the environmental
    range from +130:C down to ?230:C during Phase 1, and from +200:C down to ?230:C
    during Phase 2. The switching transistors for the controller will be based on silicon-germanium
    (SiGe) because of its demonstrated ability to operate well at extreme temperatures.
    The outcome of this project will be an operating hardware system, not a simulation.rnThis
    innovation will be applicable to upcoming NASA missions to the surface of the Moon
    and Mars, as well as to other missions that need controllers for motors and actuators
    operating directly in extreme environments. Motor-control systems are also needed
    for space-based observatories, for example for the deformable cryogenic optical
    systems on the James Webb Space Telescope. Moreover, there are potential applications
    for extreme-temperature power electronics in the industrial, commercial and defense
    sectors.  The Phase 1 demonstration target is an H-bridge control circuit, pulse-width
    modulated, for controlling the speed and direction of a 20 W dc motor. The circuit
    will incorporate four silicon-germanium (SiGe) HBTs, because of their demonstrated
    advantages for extreme-temperature operation.  In addition, the proposing organization,
    GPD Optoelectronics Corp., has developed SiGe power transistors that operate down
    to ?230:C. The drive circuitry will use optoelectronic coupling.  Suitable packaging
    technologies for the extreme environment will be developed and reliability testing
    will be performed. A complete prototype system will be delivered at the conclusion
    of each Phase.rnThe proposed motor-control subsystem is an innovation because there
    are presently no such subsystems capable of operation over the extreme-environment
    range from +130:C or +200:C down to ?230:C. rn",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
