  true,\n\t\"url\": null,\n\t\"notes\": \"Several different unsupervised anomaly detection
  algorithms have been applied to Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) data to serve the
  purpose of developing a comprehensive suite of Integrated Systems Health Management
  (ISHM) tools. As the theoretical bases for these methods vary considerably, it is
  reasonable to conjecture that the resulting anomalies detected by them may differ
  quite significantly as well. As such, it would be useful to apply a common metric
  with which to compare the results. However, for such a quantitative analysis to
  be statistically significant, a sufficient number of examples of both nominally
  categorized and anomalous data must be available. Due to the lack of sufficient
  examples of anomalous data, use of any statistics that rely upon a statistically
  significant sample of anomalous data is infeasible. Therefore, the main focus of
  this paper will be to compare actual examples of anomalies detected by the algorithms
  via the sensors in which they appear, as well the times at which they appear. We
  find that there is enough overlap in detection of the anomalies among all of the
  different algorithms tested in order for them to corroborate the severity of these
  anomalies. In certain cases, the severity of these anomalies is supported by their
  categorization as failures by experts, with realistic physical explanations. For
  those anomalies that can not be corroborated by at least one other method, this
  overlap says less about the severity of the anomaly, and more about their technical
  nuances, which will also be discussed. \",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S. Government

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
