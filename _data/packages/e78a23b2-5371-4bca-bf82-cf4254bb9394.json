	"notes": "The land remote sensing community has a long history of using supervised and unsupervised methods to help interpret and analyze remote sensing data sets. Until relatively recently, most remote sensing studies have used fairly conventional image processing and pattern recognition methodologies. In the past decade, NASA has launched a series of remote sensing missions known as the Earth Observing System (EOS). The data sets acquired by EOS instruments provide an extremely rich source of information related to the properties and dynamics of the Earthu2019s terrestrial ecosystems. However, these data are also characterized by large volumes and complex spectral, spatial and temporal attributes. Because of the volume and complexity of EOS data sets, efficient and effective analysis of them presents significant challenges that are difficult to address using conventional remote sensing approaches. In this paper we discuss results from applying a variety of different data mining approaches to global remote sensing data sets. Specifically, we describe three main problem domains and sets of analyses: (1) supervised classification of global land cover from using data from NASAu2019s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer; (2) the use of linear and non-linear cluster and dimensionality reduction methods to examine coupled climate-vegetation dynamics using a twenty year time series of data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer; and (3) the use of functional models, non-parametric clustering, and mixture models to help interpret and understand the feature space and class structure of high dimensional remote sensing data sets. The paper will not focus on specific details of algorithms. Instead we describe key results, successes, and lessons learned from ten years of research focusing on the use of data mining and machine learning methods for remote sensing and Earth science problems.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
