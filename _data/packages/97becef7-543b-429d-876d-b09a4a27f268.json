	"notes": "Summary of survey efforts and locatons of big-eared bats and southeastern myotis in Mississippi. Mist net and roost surveys were conducted from March 2002- February 2007 to determine the distribution and relative abundance of Rafinesque's big-eared bat (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) and southeastern myotis (Myotis austroriparius) in Mississippi. Mist net surveys were conducted at 9 study areas in 12 counties from March 2002- August 2006. A total of 425 bats were captured representing 8 species. Twenty nine Rafinesque's big-eared bats, representing 7% of all captures, were captured at 2 study areas (St. Catherine Creek National Wildlife Refuge [NWR] and Camp Shelby). Thirty-three southeastern myotis, representing 8% of all captures, were captured at 6 study areas (St. Catherine Creek NWR, Camp Shelby, Noxubee NWR, Meridian Naval Air Station, Caney Creek Wildlife Management Area and Laurel Hill Plantation). To determine relative abundance and roost preferences for Rafinesque's big-eared bat and southeastern myotis, abandoned buildings, culverts, cisterns, and caves were surveyed in select locations in 17 counties in Mississippi. Seven abandoned buildings located on St. Catherine Creek NWR, Adams County, were surveyed 2 - 9 times a month from August- October 2002 and March- October 2003. Rafinesque's big-eared bat individuals used all 7 buildings as roosts, 3 of which were confirmed maternal colonies. One of these maternal roosts contained 50 individuals in July 2003. Six of the 7 roosts were also used by southeastern myotis with a maximum of 5 individuals observed in 1 of the roosts in June 2003. Four artificial bat houses constructed at St. Catherine Creek NWR specifically designed to attract Rafinesque's big-eared bat (1 shed design and 3 artificial tree designs), were surveyed in April and July 2005, February, May, and August 2006, and March 2007. Bats were never observed in the shed design artificial roost. One to 2 Rafinesque's big-eared bats were observed in each of the artificial tree roosts on several occasions, with 1 roost containing 48 individuals in August 2006. Two abandoned houses on Noxubee NWR, Noxubee County, were surveyed in May 2004 and were found to contain 2 Rafinesque's big-eared bats each. One abandoned house owned by the Conservation Club, a private land holding in Clay County, was surveyed in May and June 2004. Sixty-two individuals were observed in May 2004 making this the largest known maternal colony for this species in Mississippi. Ten cisterns in Adams County were surveyed from February 2003- January 2006. Rafinesque's big-eared bats were not observed in these cisterns during the survey period, however 3 cisterns contained large colonies of southeastern myotis. Using infrared cameras, bats were recorded emerging from occupied cisterns at sunset to determine abundance. In August 2004, 5,479 individuals were recorded emerging from a cistern at Laurel Hill Plantation and 6,486 were recorded emerging from a cistern at Hollywood Plantation. A second cistern at Hollywood Plantation contained 5,681 in May 2004. These are the largest known maternal colonies for southeastern myotis in Mississippi. One culvert on Laurel Hill Plantation, a private holding adjacent to St. Catherine Creek NWR, was surveyed for bat occupancy 6 times from February 2003- January 2005. One Rafinesque's big-eared bat was observed several times and 5 southeastern myotis were observed in January 2005. Seven culverts on Meridian Naval Air Station, Lauderdale County, were surveyed for bat occupancy in May 2002 and monthly from March 2005-November 2006. Five Rafinesque's big-eared bats were observed in May 2002, but have not been observed since. All the culverts were commonly used by SE myotis, 1 of which was a confirmed maternal colony. Twenty-two caves were surveyed in 11 counties from October 2005- February 2007.  Over the last 12 years, county records in the Mississippi Natural Heritage Database have increased form 6-22 records for Rafi",
