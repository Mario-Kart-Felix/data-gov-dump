	"notes": "Accurate estimates of the radiative effects of clouds and aerosolsrnare essential for an understanding of the Earth's climate system.rnUnder the EOS program, NASA has placed into orbit a series of satellitesrndevoted to long term observations of the climate state. Central to the observation of the radiation balance are the CERES instruments that fly on both the Terra (2000-present) and Aqua (2002-present) platforms, each in tandem with a MODIS imager.rnAnother CERES instrument has been launched (late 2011) upon the Suomi NPP satellite along with the MODIS successor, VIIRS. The CERES mission depends on an aerosol assimilation system to augment information from MODIS-based aerosol inversions and allow for the creation of datasets such as surface radiative fluxes. This project will enhance the existing CERES aerosol assimilation system in several ways.rn(1) We will construct assimilation functionality for VIIRS aerosols,rnmerged MODIS and VIIRS aerosols and potentially aerosol retrievals from other instruments.rn(2) To facilitate multi-sensor data assimilation we will create an IDL toolkit, SatelliteDL, for the analysis of satellite Earth observationsrnfrom a diverse set of platforms and sensors. The design will feature an abstraction layer that allows for easy inclusion of new datasets in a modular way. The core function of the toolkit will be the spatial and temporal alignment of satellite swath and geostationary data.rn(3) We will construct an ensemble Kalman filter aerosol assimilation system. This will allow for robust statistical uncertainty estimates in aerosol quantities of importance to the radiative forcing of the climate.rnTwo recent advances have made such an approach possible.rnFirst, the MODIS mission has quantified aerosol retrieval uncertainties based on extensive comparisons to surface measurements, and second, the international AeroCom collaboration has established the feasibility of generating aerosol ensembles based on statistical model emulation.",

What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
