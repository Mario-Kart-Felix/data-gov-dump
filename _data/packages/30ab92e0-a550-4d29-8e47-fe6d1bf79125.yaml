    Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, from 20110407 to 20110509, marine invertebrate quantitative assessments
    were conducted, as part of Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA), during the Reef Assessment
    and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruise HA1101 in the Northern Marianas Islands. Such
    cruises are conducted at biennial intervals by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division
    (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). At specific
    reef sites, marine invertebrate zoologists along with coral and algal biologists
    entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~100 m2) and high degree of taxonomic
    resolution benthic REA survey for coral, algae, and key invertebrate species. Invertebrate
    surveys were focused on quantifying key non-coral invertebrate species common to
    the reef habitats, and were conducted using a belt-transect survey method. In belt-transect
    surveys, quantitative counts of key invertebrates were recorded along two consecutively-placed
    25m long and 2m wide belt transects (total area = 100 m2). For any species that
    cannot be identified in the field, a photograph and a representative specimen, if
    possible, is collected for later identification. Based on data from previous REA
    surveys, a group of target invertebrate species was chosen for quantitative counts
    at 3 REA sites at Guguan Island in the Marianas Islands. The species in the list
    were chosen because they have been shown to be common components of the reef habitats
    and they are species that are generally visible (i.e.; non-cryptic) and easily enumerated
    during the course of a single 50-60 minute SCUBA survey.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
