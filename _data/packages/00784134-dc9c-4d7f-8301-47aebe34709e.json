The heat exchanger utilizes paraffin wax to aid in the process of supplying a vehicle a sources of supplemental heat rejection when needed. NASA Johnson Space Center has partnered with UTC Aerospace via a NASA NRA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The second heat exchanger is a water-based Phase Change Material Heat Exchanger and is currently at a TRL of 3. Johnson Space Center has partnered with Mezzo Technologies to develop the next generation of light weight water based PCM HXs.&lt;ul style="list-style-type:circle"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leveraging a Phase III Maturation SBIR in partnership with Mezzo Technologies to evaluate multiple water-based PCM HX concepts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial phase of development includes the development and fabrication of wax PCM HX with UTAS for flight demonstration on the International Space Station. The ISS Program is supporting the project by providing resources to build and certify for flight a platform that can aid in demonstrating these PCM HXs on the ISS. In parallel to this effort, the project will work with Mezzo Technologies to advance the TRL of the water based PCM HX. Water is known to have the double latent energy storage of wax based PCMs. With this increase in energy storage, by using water as a PCM, the project can leverage possible mass and volume savings. If determined viable, the project will transition the development into the fabrication of a flight water PCM HX for demonstration on the same ISS research platform. Through testing these heat exchangers in an environment that only the International Space Station can provide, NASA will help advance PCM HX technology for future exploration and commercial crew vehicles. Currently, Orion has baselined the use of PCM HXs in its Exploration Mission 2 architecture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
