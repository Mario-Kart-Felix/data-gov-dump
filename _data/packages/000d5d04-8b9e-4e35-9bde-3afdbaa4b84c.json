	"notes": "Single crystal silicon is a desirable mirror substrate for scan mirrors in space telescopes. As diameters of mirrors become larger, existing manufacturing capabilities of single crystal silicon (SCSi) cannot supply sizes that are larger than about 450 mm in diameter. Onyx Optics proposes to develop a process based on our established technique of Adhesive-Free Bonding (AFB&amp;#174;) of single crystals, optical ceramics and glasses that can produce sizes that are larger than commercially available SCSi. The precision composites, consisting of SCSi components, are expected to perform as well as a single crystal. Precision grinding and polishing of large composite SCSi without subsurface damage is a desirable feature for large scan mirror substrates. As part of the proposed manufacturing process, Onyx Optics proposes to develop a technique that is based on electrolytic in-process dressing (ELID) of grinding wheels of decreasing diamond grain sizes. The process is generally applicable to ductile grinding of hard materials such as glass, sapphire, silicon carbide, silicon nitride and SCSi and is known to result in low stress components. rnrnComposite SCSi interfaces will be charactized interferometrically at 1.55 micron by their transmitted wavefront. Heat transfer measurements across bonded interfaces of SCSi will be performed at room temperature and liquid nitrogen. Equi-biaxial fracture strength of composite disks will be determined and compared with control disks.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
