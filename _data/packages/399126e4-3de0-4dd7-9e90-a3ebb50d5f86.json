	"notes": "Remote sensing of optical properties of oceans and coastal waters provides essential information for various scientific questions and applications, including monitoring biological biomass and productivity, biogeochemical cycling of carbon, pollution, and ecosystem health.  OKSI, with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), propose the development of novel instrumentation package that will measure in both airborne and submersible applications the upwelling and downwelling radiative fluxes in the UV-VIS-NIR range with high spectral resolution.rnrnIn Phase I science requirements will be defined and translated into engineering requirements, and the design of an existing hyperspectral sensor modified to (1) simultaneously measure both the upwelling (in pushbroom imaging mode) and the downwelling (non-imaging) spectra, and (2) extend the spectral range to the UV.  In Phase-II the prototype instruments will be built and flown on a SIO Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and tested in an SIO submersible system.  rnrnOcean color satellite data currently provides information at low spectral resolution (several discrete wavebands) and relatively low spatial resolution (~1 km).  The proposed instrumentation package will fill a major gap in science capabilities by providing hyperspectral data with sufficiently high spatial resolution necessary for improved retrievals of information about in-water constituents/properties in highly dynamic coastal environments.  rnrnThe project outcome at the end of Phase-II will be at TRL 6.  rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
