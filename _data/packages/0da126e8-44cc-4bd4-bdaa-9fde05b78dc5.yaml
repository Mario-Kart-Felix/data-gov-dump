    Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) in Tennessee (Chickasaw, Cross Creeks, Hatchie, Lake Isom,
    Lower Hatchie and Reelfoot) from 1988 and 1990. Fish samples were obtained at each
    of these refuges and sediment samples were collected at three (Cross Creeks, Lower
    Hatchie and Reelfoot). Results for analyses of a bald eagle egg collected at Reelfoot
    NWR and turtles collected at Cross Creeks NWR are also included. All fish and sediment
    samples were analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 22 chlorinated hydrocarbon
    insecticides or related compounds, and 13 metals. Sediment samples from Reelfoot
    NWR and Lower Hatchie NWR (Sunk Lake) were also analyzed for six chlorophenoxy herbicides,
    none of which were detected. Nine additional organochlorine compounds were analyzed
    in fish and sediment samples from Lower Hatchie (Sunk Lake), but were not detected.
    Ten additional metals were analyzed in fish samples from Reelfoot and Cross Creeks
    NWRs. Thallium was analyzed in samples from Chickasaw, Hatchie, Lake Isom and Lower
    Hatchie NWRs, but was not detected. Thirty-four fish samples representing 12 species
    were collected. Gar specimens, either spotted or shortnose, were obtained from all
    refuges except Cross Creeks, where channel catfish and blue catfish were collected.
    Of the 34 fish samples collected, DDE was detected in all except the blue catfish
    from Pool 8 at Cross Creeks NWR. Mercury (Hg) was found in all 34 fish and five
    turtle samples. PCBs were detected in all four fish samples from Chickasaw NWR,
    three gar samples from Lower Hatchie NWR, and four catfish samples and one turtle
    sample from Cross Creeks NWR. DDT was detected only at Hatchie NWR, where it was
    found in four of the five samples collected. None of the pesticides, herbicides
    or PCBs analyzed in this study were detected in the sediment samples which were
    collected. The PCB residues in our fish samples were well below whole-body concentrations
    linked to mortality and reduced growth in adult fish of the same, or closely related,
    species. At several locations, total PCBs exceeded the whole-body residue (0.4mg/kg)
    for Aroclor 1242 which has been associated with low egg survival and fry deformities
    in rainbow trout (USEPA 1980). The total PCB concentration (5.4 ppm) in the bald
    eagle egg from Reelfoot NWR was in the lower ranges reported for the Columbia River
    and the Great Lakes. It also fell into the range of concentrations associated with
    production of one young per active nesting pair in the Great lakes (Kubiak and Best
    1991). DDE in the bald eagle egg from Reelfoot NWR was in the lower range of concentrations
    associated with reduced productivity in bald eagles and 12-15% eggshell thinning
    in ospreys. It was well below the egg residue associated with 10% eggshell thinning
    in bald eagle eggs from the Columbia River basin. Mercury residues in fish samples
    were well below concentrations associated with mortality in walleye, brook trout
    and fathead minnows. In one sample (bowfin - Lower Hatchie NWR), the Hg concentration
    (0.7 ppm) approached lower concentrations associated with diminished predator avoidance
    behavior in mosquitofish (Kania and O'Hara 1974). Mercury in the bald eagle egg
    from Reelfoot NWR was below the geometric mean in unhatched bald eagle eggs reported
    by Wiemeyer et al. (1984). It was also well below the concentration associated with
    decreased reproductive success by Newton and Galbraith (1991).",nt"license_title":
