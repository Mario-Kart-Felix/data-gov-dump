	"notes": "The proposed project will investigate the feasibility of utilizing ThinKom's low cost electronically scanned array (ESA) antenna concepts to enable affordable airborne hazard detection and avoidance radar systems with greatly enhanced performance relative to those currently deployed. This technology is comprised of a unique integrated feed/phase shifter/radiator topology that can be realized using very low cost manufacturing techniques and COTS electronics. Although it utilizes a densely spaced array of discrete radiators that allows the "grating lobe free" operation of traditional high cost phased arrays, the architecture is amenable to "quasi-monolithic" construction from a small number of inexpensive parts. It also enables the use of a highly reliable, low cost, low power consumption beam steering controller. The estimated total loss through the feed, phase shifter, and radiator is less than 1 dB at X-Band. The Phase I program will focus on creating a design for a small proof-of-concept (POC) ESA, and on doing a hardware demonstration of the phase shifter architecture. When fabricated under a Phase II program the POC unit will demonstrate the revolutionary cost reduction potential of this technology.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
