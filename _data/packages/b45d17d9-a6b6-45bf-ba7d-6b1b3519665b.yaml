    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;The problem to be solved here is
    that of designing complex interplanetary trajectories to destinations which are
    difficult to reach via direct flights and chemical propulsion. Some targets, such
    as Mars and Venus, are reachable using direct flights with chemical propulsion technology.
    Others, such as the Mercury, the outer planets, main-belt asteroids, comets, and
    many other scientifically interesting targets are not easily accessible, i.e. the
    &amp;Delta;v required to reach them via direct chemical flights is too high and
    therefore payloads of useful size cannot be easily delivered. There are two ways
    to mitigate this problem. One is by using more efficient propulsion systems, such
    as low-thrust solar electric propulsion (SEP). The other is to find more efficient
    paths to the destination, possibly including gravity assist maneuvers, also known
    as planetary flybys. Even better solutions might be found by combining these techniques.
    Unfortunately these trajectory optimization problems are very difficult to solve.
    The multiple-flyby interplanetary trajectory optimization problem is characterized
    by having a highly nonlinear objective function, several nonlinear constraints to
    enforce feasibility (i.e. preventing the spacecraft from coming dangerously close
    to a planet) and many locally optimal solutions. The large number of locally optimal
    solutions makes finding the global optimum very difficult. The low-thrust trajectory
    optimization problem is characterized by a very large number of nonlinear decision
    variables and constraints. Problems which involve both planetary flybys and low-thrust
    propulsion suffer combine the two sets of challenges &amp;ndash; they have many
    locally optimal solutions and also many (hundreds to thousands) of decision variables
    and many (tens to hundreds) of nonlinear constraints. There are several methods
    that have been previously used to solve this type of problem. The most successful
    of these has been to search for combinations of planetary flybys using a grid search
    method or intuition and a highly simplified trajectory model, as in the case of
    Jet Propulsion Lab&amp;rsquo;s STOUR and STOUR-LTGA. A higher fidelity tool such
    as MALTO, GMAT, or Copernicus is then used to refine the solution. The main problem
    with traditional design techniques is the risk of never considering the combination
    of choices that produces the optimal solution. When one uses a low-fidelity grid
    search, it is possible that the globally optimal solution will not be captured in
    the grid. In turn the higher-fidelity local optimization tools like MALTO, GMAT,
    and Copernicus will only converge to a locally optimal solution in the neighborhood
    of the user-supplied initial guess. None of the existing methods allow for fully
    autonomous global optimization of missions that include flybys, low-thrust propulsion,
    or combinations of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
