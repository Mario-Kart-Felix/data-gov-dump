	"notes": "Validating software is a critical step in developing high confidencensystems.  Typical software development practices are not acceptable innsystems where failure leads to loss of life or other high costs.  Newnsoftware development tools are needed to radically reduce defect ratesnand enable the high levels of confidence required for safety- andnsecurity-critical systems.  Lightweight verification techniques havenproven themselves effective in finding defects in large software systemsnby balancing rigor with scalability and usability.  Lightweightnverification techniques do not exhaustively check software, but they cannfind defects in systems that are too large for more rigorous analysisntechniques, and are fast becoming an essential tool for softwarendevelopers.  The techniques generally fail to address key sources ofnproblems specific to embedded systems: paths due to asynchronousntransfer of control or context switches between tasks are notnconsidered; assembly language components are ignored; it is hard tondetect violations of domain-specific rules.  We propose to extend andnadapt our static analysis technology to make it capable of addressingnthese problems.  We will exploit our existing connections with NASAnfacilities to gain help validating our approach and to ensure that thensolution we propose is responsive to NASA's unique needs.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
