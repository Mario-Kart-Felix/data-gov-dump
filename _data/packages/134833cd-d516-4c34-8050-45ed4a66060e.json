	"notes": "The objective of this proposal is to study and demonstrate novelnGaAsNP/GaP/AlGaP technology for use in extreme photovoltaic (PV) energynconversion.  NASA and the scientific community are interested in solarnmissions that go as far as Saturn or even into near sun conditions.nSuch missions present a challenging problem for PV technology.  Innaddition to the requisite high efficiency and reduced solar cell payloadnmass, these missions require a PV technology that can withstand thenincreased solar intensity, radiation and temperature.   We proposenstudying two possible solar cell designs:  The first design utilizesnnovel, wide gap GaP-based materials to provide bandgaps well suited fornhigh-temperature operation and to enhance function in high radiation andnnear sun missions.  Such an approach will enable solar cells to operatenat and above 450 Celcius with the highest possible efficiency.  As partnof this study we would investigate the deposition of AlGaP on GaP tonprovide materials with bandgaps at or above 2.4 eV.  The second designnwe will investigate uses more standard materials that EpiWorks hasnalready developed for different applications.  This design would employnInAlP (2.4eV bandgap) lattice-matched to GaAs as the key wide gapnmaterial.  We will study the expected temperature dependence and othernkey thermal properties of such a design and compare to the GaP-based approach.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
