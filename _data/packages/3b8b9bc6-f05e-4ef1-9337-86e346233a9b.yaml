    place to work on understanding and reducing the impacts of land based sources pollution
    on corals:nnInput of Sediments and Nutrients into Cocos Lagoon and Surrounding Areas
    from the Manell Geus Watershed, Guam: This project will characterize sedimentation
    and nutrient dynamics in the area of Cocos Lagoon, Guam specifically in the Achang
    Reef Flat Marine Preserve, and in adjacent coastal areas that receive inputs from
    the Manell-Geus watershed, a Habitat Focus Area.  Sediments and nutrients are suspected
    of degrading water quality, particularly in the Achang Preserve.  Adjacent aquaculture
    facilities may be an additional source of nutrients and perhaps pharmaceuticals
    (e.g., antibiotics).  Monthly collections of water samples will be analyzed for
    nutrients; sedimentation would be characterized using sediment traps and pods.  Antibiotics
    eill be quantified using passive water samplers.nnTechnical Support of Inception
    of FDEP Coral Reef Nutrient Monitoring Program: At the request of Florida Department
    of Environmental Protection (FDEP), NOAA NCCOS will provide technical expertise
    in nutrient monitoring/assessment on the coral reefs of the FL northern one third
    of the Florida Reef Tract, including sampling design, interlaboratory comparison,
    and spatial/statistical analysis. At the completion of the project, operations of
    the monitoring program will fully transition to FDEP.  nnEutrophication Impacts
    on Coral Ecosystem Health in Vatia, American Samoa: Nutrient pollution in Vatia
    Bay has been hypothesized by jurisdictional managers to be having an adverse effect
    on the reefs via benthic algal blooms. In 2015, NOAA scientists initiated monitoring
    in Vatia Bay in order to quantify dynamics in Vatia Bay and establish a baseline
    against which to compare changes in the benthic algal and coral assemblages in response
    to nutrient fluxes. Local scientists were trained to continue the water quality
    sampling on a monthly basis. FY16 funding would be used to continue the monitoring,
    which is necessary to quantify interannual variability.nnOcean Color Product for
    Monitoring the Threat of Land-Based Sources of Pollution to Coral Reefs: CRW is
    developing near-real-time tools to provide managers with oceanic turbidity and chlorophyll
    levels in coastal waters surrounding each USCRTF priority watershed and adjacent
    coral reefs. The project employs NOAAu00e2u0080u0099s newest operational color algorithm
    to produce these variables using data from NOAAu00e2u0080u0099s Visible Infrared
    Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument. Building on a two-year effort funded
    by NESDIS/STARu00e2u0080u0099s Ocean Remote Sensing Program and the FY15 joint ORS-/CRCP-funded
    effort in Guu00c3u00a1nica, we will work closely with local managers in Hawaii and
    Puerto Rico to develop remote sensing tools for each jurisdiction allowing managers
    to assess LBSP threats to their coral reefs.nnDetermining the efficacy of watershed
    management in the Wahikuli and Honokowai watersheds, West Maui: Monitoring has documented
    a 50%u00e2u0080u009375% decline of coral cover in West Maui (Kau00e2u0080u0099anaplaiu00e2u0080u0093Honolua)
    watersheds and available data are insufficient to adequately assess recovery potential
    of these reefs. This project seeks to: 1) Expand year 1 work to assess and report
    on demographic status of corals for the northern West Maui watershed; 2) share and
    incorporate results to help ground-truth mapping efforts by CREDu00e2u0080u0099s
    EcoSpatial Team, and to produce a Maui Priority Watershed Area Status Report; and
    3) integrate results into a Final Report on the distribution, status, and condition
    of the benthic communities in the Priority West Maui Watershed.n",nt"owner_org":
