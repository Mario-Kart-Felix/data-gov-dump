    from the 2001 version of the PNW River Reach files Arc/INFO coverage. Separate,
    companion feature classes are also available from StreamNet, including a ROUTE system
    built on this layer's LLID attribute and the related POLYGON waterbody features.
    Background: The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Portland, in cooperation with Bonneville
    Power Administration, the Northwest Power Planning Council, and other Federal and
    state agencies and NW Indian Tribes produced a 1:100,000-scale River Reach data
    layer for the Pacific Northwest in the early 1990s. The Pacific Northwest (PNW)
    1:100k River Reach Files (RF3) are a geo-referenced river reach data layer that
    encompasses the Columbia River Basin within the conterminous United States, the
    coasts of Oregon and Washington, Puget Sound in Washington, the Klamath and Goose
    Lake Basins in southern Oregon and the Bear Lake Basin in southeastern Idaho. The
    system is basically a 1:100,000 scale enhancement of the pre-existing 1:250,000
    scale EPA River Reach File 2 (RF2). The RF3 creation process was a primary task
    of the PNW River Reach Project because these reach identifiers are an integral hydrologic
    component in a regional rivers and fisheries information system now known as StreamNet
    (formerly the Coordinated Information System (CIS) and the Northwest Environmental
    Database (NED)). StreamNet is an ongoing effort by federal, state, and tribal organizations
    within the region to compile reach and stream specific information pertinent to
    the Region's fish and wildlife resources in Oregon, Idaho, Washington, and western
    Montana. The PNW Reach Files carry the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (US
    EPA) river reach numbers. The system was transferred over to the StreamNet project
    at Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) in early 1997 for maintenance,
    enhancement, and distribution. This dataset was last updated in August of 2001 and
    includes changes and corrections to the 100k Reach Files originally posted on the
    streamnet site (www.streamnet.org) in the fall of 1997. Numerous routing errors
    have been corrected, flow direction of routes and arcs has been made consistent,
    and attribute miscodes have been addressed. In addition, the files maintained by
    WDFW, IDFG, ODFW, and MFWP have been made consistent, especially in the hucs along
    the state borders. All of the LLIDs in these coverages have been approved by the
    state fish and wildlife agencies, and will be kept unchanged unless compelling reasons
    necessitate updates. Some routes may have LLIDs different than those posted in earlier
    versions, but every effort has been made to minimize this as much as is practical.
