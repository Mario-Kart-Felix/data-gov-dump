    Ecosystems from Uncharacteristic Wildland Fire The intent of this issue is to: o
    Identify where communities and their associated forestlands are at greatest risk
    from uncharacteristic wildfires; o Identify areas where departure from historic
    fire regimes may lead to uncharacteristic wildland fires areas where damaging insects
    threaten forest health This layer was constructed by using the following layers:
    1. The Relative Risk to Communities from Wildland Fire in Idaho model, developed
    by the Idaho Interagency Wildland Fire Plan Working Group. A complete description
    of this model is available for download at: http://www.idahofireplan.org/images/Assessment.pdf.
    The assessment was completed by Jeff Jones, Landscape Ecologist, Flathead National
    Forest, and others from the State Fire Plan Working Group. This model considers
    relative wildland fire risk (weather, ignition probability, rate of spread), relative
    wildland fire hazard (fuel hazard, expected fuel moisture, slope effect on fire
    spread) and wildland urban interface (inhabited areas, communities at risk). This
    dataset identifies wildland urban communities from the Federal Register (66 Fed.
    Reg. 753, January 4, 2001). The SAFR Core Development Team felt this model best
    informed the issue of community risk to wildfire and is supported by the Interagency
    Fire Plan Working Group. 2. Fire Regime Condition Classes (FRCC): This dataset shows
    changes in vegetation and fuels from historical conditions. From this map, inferences
    can be made to characterize forest lands with higher potential of uncharacteristic
    wildland fires (if ignitions were to occur). It is deemed the best indicator available
    of potential threat to forest systems from uncharacteristic fire. FRCC was used
    in the Idaho Roadless Rule to assess potential for uncharacteristic wildfires, and
    to evaluate the ability to treat fuels to reduce this potential. Information on
    this dataset can be found at: http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2004_menakis001.pdf.
    Issue Process: The Relative Risk to Communities from Wildland Fire in Idaho dataset
    was reclassified into five groups (1-5), from very low risk to very high risk, using
    natural breaks in the data. The FRCC data measures relative departure from historic
    fire regimes in three categories (1-3), from low departure to high. This data was
    first masked to include only forested areas, and then reclassified into three categories
    with values of 1, 3 and 5. Instead of adding these two datasets together, they were
    merged such that the highest value from either dataset became the value for that
    cell. For example, if either the Relative Risk to Communities from Wildland fire
    or the FRCC had a value of five for a particular cell, that cell received a value
    of five. Idaho Statewide Assessment of Forest Resources document contains additional
    information and can be found at: http://www.idl.idaho.gov/bureau/ForestAssist/safr/final/061410-ID-SAFR-FINAL.pdf.",nt"license_title":
