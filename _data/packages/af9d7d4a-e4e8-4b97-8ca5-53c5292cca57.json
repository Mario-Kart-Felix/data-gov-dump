	"notes": "As part of the federally-mandated Basic Water Monitoring Program, Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has been conducting annual statewide fish tissue analyses for organic compounds, including chlordane. Results have shown a tempora1 variation pattern in chlordane residue levels in fish from non-tidal areas since 1977. The Patuxent River is one the rivers included in this survey. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine chlordane levels in fish found in the Patuxent River and compare these with State data; and (2) determine the geographic distribution of chlordane present in fish from the coastal plain non-tidal portion of the Patuxent River. Three brown bullheads* and a sediment sample were collected from each of six locations on the Patuxent and Little Patuxent Rivers from Laurel, Maryland to Davidsonville, Maryland. One of the fish specimens from each site was separated into fillet and carcass portions for analysis in order to determine chlordane residue levels in edible portions. The remaining two specimens underwent whole body analysis. Samples were subjected to an organochlorine scan to detect chlordane residue levels. All but one of the fish specimens had detectable levels of chlordane, however these levels were lower than those found by MDE in the same areas in 1983-84. None of the sediment samples had detectable chlordane levels. A trend of decreasing levels in fish was noted from upstream to downstream, but the difference was not significant. The lower chlordane levels in fish found in this section of the Patuxent River in 1988 tend to support the temporal variation pattern previously noted by MDE. Chlordane levels appear to have peaked in 1983-84. The fact that the noted decreasing trend in chlordane levels from upstream to downstream stations was not significant may have been due to small sample size or sample site proximity. There does not appear to be a health risk associated with chlordane levels in fish in this section of the Patuxent River at the present time. * At one station only one brown bullhead was caught. The remaining two specimens from this site were white catfish.",
