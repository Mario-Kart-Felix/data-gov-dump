The photos were interpreted using a 1-acre 10% minimum vegetation cover to delineate land cover\/land use, percent vegetation cover, tree height, and hydrology regime. The geographic extent of Navigation Pool 8 is the section of the river upstream of Lock and Dam 8 (river mile 679.2) located near Genoa, WI, to Lock and Dam 7 (river mile 702.5) located near Dresbach, MN.",
