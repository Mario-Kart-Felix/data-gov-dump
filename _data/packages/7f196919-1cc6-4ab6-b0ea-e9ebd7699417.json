	"notes": "tThe integration of the analysis tools with the advanced visualization capabilities in The Intelligent Flight Support System (IFSS)  can provide a unique method for investigating dynamic spatial problems.  The IFSS will use a simple joystick driven navigation paradigm to navigate throughout the environment by simply flying through the space.  In this manner, the FC has the ability to move around and into the ISS while maintaining a fixed gaze towards the ISS.  This allows the FC to view the ISS and Space Shuttle from different perspectives and perform several different analyses that provide input to the IFSS visualization software.  The user interface will be comprised of two distinct data and intelligent components.  The data component provides FCs with all currently used displays at MCC while the intelligent component is used to provide the FCs with what-if, goal-seeking and graphing capabilities.  In addition, an expert system will be embedded in the intelligent component allowing FCs to perform more sophisticated analysis, such as dual angle operations, feathering for docking, shadow analysis, auto tracking.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
