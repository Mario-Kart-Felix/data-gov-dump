	"notes": "This image represents a 1 meter resolution backscatter mosaic of the bathymetry of a reef shelf\/bank south of Vieques, Puerto Rico. NOAA's NOS\/NCCOS\/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in and around the Northeast Reserve from 3\/05\/2013 to 3\/29\/2013. Data was acquired with a moon pool mounted Reson 7125 multibeam echosounder (400 kHz). Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The backscatter component of the bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using .HSX and .7k file pairs that were converted to GSF in Hypack 2012, then processed in Fledermaus Geocoder Toolbox 7.3.3c. Acoustic backscatter mosaics are an important piece of information when characterizing surficial seafloor features and delineating benthic habitats. The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.",
