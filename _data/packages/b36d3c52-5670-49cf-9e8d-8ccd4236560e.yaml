    backscatter mosaic of the north shore of St. Croix, US Virgin Islands and southwest
    shore (La Parguera) of Puerto Rico. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in
    collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private
    sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from
    3/21/06 to 4/2/06. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002
    multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS
    software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been
    reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS.
    Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The backscatter component of the bathymetry
    data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using Geocoder 2.8 software.
    Acoustic backscatter mosaics are ostensibly an important piece of information when
    characterizing surficial seafloor features and delineating benthic habitats. The
    project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on
    the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability
    of this data according to their own needs and standards.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
