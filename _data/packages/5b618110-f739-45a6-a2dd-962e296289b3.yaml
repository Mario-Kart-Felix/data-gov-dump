    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;This project is focused on developing
    a continually evolving modular backbone architecture for the Deep Space Habitat
    (DSH) instrumentation system by integrating new instrumentation technologies and
    technology demonstrations into the DSH.&amp;nbsp; By creating a modular architecture,
    instrumentation can be easily&amp;nbsp; changed out in the event of failures, or
    upgraded to newer versions of hardware.&amp;nbsp; The instrumentation system is
    continuously evolving as hardware is upgraded as a result of lessons learned from
    previous tests, and as new hardware is implemented to evaluate new technologies
    and technology demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accomplishments:
    A Flat Surface Damage Detection System (FSDDS) panel (KSC technology) was successfully
    integrated with DSH software and tested over SNRF networks.&amp;nbsp; This demonstration
    proves the capability of interconnecting testbeds and enables future technology
    development/testing in this manner.&amp;nbsp; The FSDDS also successfully tested
    multiple panels interconnected in a standalone configuration; A Radiation Environment
    Monitor (REM) was successfully integrated and tested.&amp;nbsp; The team also collected
    important data on background radiation levels; The RFID system previously developed
    for the Geology Laboratory Workstation was further integrated with software.&amp;nbsp;
    This system successfully tracked all rock samples and organized the data for each
    sample; An RFID system was successfully integrated into the medical operations workstation
    to provide inventory management of medical devices and supplies; A portable Fourier
    Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer was integrated as a standalone test.&amp;nbsp;
    The FTIR was successfully tested and the data provided interesting science on the
    composition of the internal atmosphere of the DSH, as well as the activities of
    the crew during the tests; Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSNs), the backbone architecture
    for the wireless modular instrumentation system in the DSH, were upgraded to account
    for lessons learned from the previous year.&amp;nbsp; The upgrades proved successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
