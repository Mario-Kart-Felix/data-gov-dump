	"notes": "Complex engineering systems require efficient on-line fault diagnosis methodologies to improve safety and reduce maintenance costs. Traditionally, diagnosis approaches are centralized, but these solutions do not scale well. Also, centralized diagnosis solutions are difficult to implement on increasingly prevalent distributed, networked embedded systems. This paper presents a distributed diagnosis framework for physical systems with continuous behavior. Using Possible Conflicts, a structural model decomposition method from the Artificial Intelligence model-based diagnosis (DX) community, we develop a distributed diagnoser design algorithm to build local event-based diagnosers. These diagnosers are constructed based on global diagnosability analysis of the system, enabling them to generate local diagnosis results that are globally correct without the use of a centralized coordinator. We also use Possible Conflicts to design local parameter estimators that are integrated with the local diagnosers to form a comprehensive distributed diagnosis framework. Hence, this is a fully distributed approach to fault detection, isolation, and identification. We evaluate the developed scheme on a four-wheeled rover for different design scenarios to show the advantages of using Possible Conflicts, and generate on-line diagnosis results in simulation to demonstrate the approach.

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
