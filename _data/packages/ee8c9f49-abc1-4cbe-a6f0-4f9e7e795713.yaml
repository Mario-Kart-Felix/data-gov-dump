  This dataset is comprised of 478 LiDAR files, based on the FL Statewide 5,000' by
  5,000' sheet index system in the LAS version 1.1 file format. LiDAR acquisition
  dates were January 27, January 30 through February 20, 2005. The raw data was collected
  at an average ground sample distance of 2.1 feet. Other components of the DTM include
  a personal geodatabase in accordance with the SWFWMD 2006 Topographic Database Design
  containing: obscured vegetation polygons; road overpass polygons; road breaklines;
  soft feature breaklines; water body polygons; coastal shorelines; hydrographic features
  breaklines; island polygons; and 1-foot contours. Final products include FEMA-compliant
  LIDAR-derived DTM data and 1-foot contours (for cartographic visualization purposes
  only) meeting or exceeding National Map Accuracy Standards for 2-foot contours.
  This area is not a tract, but an addition of areas to the Polk District data set.
  This data set consists of three areas within Polk County. The approximate bounding
  coordinates for each area are given below. Area 3 borders the east and north sides
  of the Peace River (North) and Judy Tract data sets. The bounding coordinates for
  Area 3 are generalized here, but it is actually a multi-sided polygon with many
  vertices. Date of Collection: 20050127, 20050130-20050220 Bounding Coordinates of
