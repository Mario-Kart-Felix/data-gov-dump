  database is a series of MS Excel spreadsheets and Access Database Tables by fiscal
  year. They consist of information from all Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs)
  performing or contracting nuclear medicine services in Veterans Affairs medical
  facilities. The medical centers are required to complete questionnaires annually
  (RCS 10-0010-Nuclear Medicine Service Annual Report). The information is then manually
  entered into the Access Tables, which includes: * Distribution and cost of in-house
  VA - Contract Physician Services, whether contracted services are made via sharing
  agreement (with another VA medical facility or other government medical providers)
  or with private providers. * Workload data for the performance and/or purchase of
  PET/CT studies. * Organizational structure of services. * Updated changes in key
  imaging service personnel (chiefs, chief technicians, radiation safety officers).
  * Workload data on the number and type of studies (scans) performed, including Medicare
  Relative Value Units (RVUs), also referred to as Weighted Work Units (WWUs). WWUs
  are a workload measure calculated as the product of a study's Current Procedural
  Terminology (CPT) code, which consists of total work costs (the cost of physician
  medical expertise and time), and total practice costs (the costs of running a practice,
  such as equipment, supplies, salaries, utilities etc). Medicare combines WWUs together
  with one other parameter to derive RVUs, a workload measure widely used in the health
  care industry. WWUs allow Nuclear Medicine to account for the complexity of each
  study in assessing workload, that some studies are more time consuming and require
  higher levels of expertise. This gives a more accurate picture of workload; productivity
  etc than using just 'total studies' would yield. * A detailed Full-Time Equivalent
  Employee (FTEE) grid, and staffing distributions of FTEEs across nuclear medicine
  services. * Information on Radiation Safety Committees and Radiation Safety Officers
  (RSOs).  Beginning in 2011 this will include data collection on part-time and non
  VA (contract) RSOs; other affiliations they may have and if so to whom they report
  (supervision) at their VA medical center.*Collection of data on nuclear medicine
  services' progress in meeting the special needs of our female veterans.* Revolving
  documentation of all major VA-owned gamma cameras (by type) and computer systems,
  their specifications and ages. * Revolving data collection for PET/CT cameras owned
  or leased by VA; and the numbers and types of PET/CT studies performed on VA patients
  whether produced on-site, via mobile PET/CT contract or from non-VA providers in
  the community.* Types of educational training/certification programs available at
  VA sites * Ongoing funded research projects by Nuclear Medicine (NM) staff, identified
  by source of funding and research purpose. * Data on physician-specific quality
  indicators at each nuclear medicine service.* Academic achievements by NM staff,
  including published books/chapters, journals and abstracts. * Information from polling
  field sites re: relevant issues and programs Headquarters needs to address. * Results
  of a Congressionally mandated contracted quality assessment exercise, also known
  as a Proficiency study. Study results are analyzed for comparison within VA facilities
  (for example by mission or size), and against participating private sector health
  care groups. * Information collected on current issues in nuclear medicine as they
  arise.  Radiation Safety Committee structures and membership, Radiation Safety Officer
  information and information on how nuclear medicine services provided for female
  Veterans are examples of current issues.The database is now stored completely within
  MS Access Database Tables with output still presented in the form of Excel graphs
