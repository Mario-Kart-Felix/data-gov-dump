	"notes": "The strength of the 1AGMI product is that it has unaltered data straight from the satellite. This product can be used to show exactly what was recorded by the GMI instrument. The 1AGMI product also contains all of the data sent down by the satellite. If there is enough bandwidth, the entire circle of GMI samples will be sent down. The 1AGMI product's swaths 4 and 5 contain all of the samples that are sent down. Later products only use the subset of these data that contains the Earth view, hot load, and cold sky samples.The 1AGMI product has two purposes: To repackage the raw satellite data from binary Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) packets to Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), and to geolocate the sample data. The counts in the 1AGMI product are the raw counts taken directly from the packets created by the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) instrument. There is no calibration or interpretation performed at the 1AGMI level. There are five swaths in the 1AGMI product: 1. Earth view, hot load, and cold sky samples for low-frequency channels. 2. Earth view, hot load, and cold sky samples for high-frequency channels. 3. Scan housekeeping data provided by instrument. 4. All samples for low-frequency channels. 5. All samples for high-frequency channels. Swaths S1 and S2 are subsets of swaths S4 and S5, respectively. The samples to subset are noted in the 1AGMI product in the gmi1aHeader/sampleRangeFile table. This is a table determined during testing and the Launch and Early Orbit (L&EO) phase of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission. Geolocation is performed on the samples using the PPS Geolocation Toolkit. The details on GMI geolocation can be found in the GMI Calibration Data Book.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
