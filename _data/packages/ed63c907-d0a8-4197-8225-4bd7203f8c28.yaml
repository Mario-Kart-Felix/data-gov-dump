    tip of Kwajalein Atoll,approximately 64 kilometers north of the U.S. Army Kwajalein
    Atoll(USAKA) central command post on Kwajalein Islet. Roi-Namur has a single sewage
    outfall, which is located at the northwestern corner of the islet. Originally, the
    outfall extended from shore to a point about halfway across the reef flat where
    the pipe ended abruptly as an upturned, uncapped elbow. Raw sewage was pumped through
    the pipe in pulses approximately every 15-20 minutes. Waves and shallow currents
    across the reef flat carried at least some of the effluent back toward shore and
    the lagoon, creating a potentially unhealthy situation. In order to correct this
    problem, USAKA implemented a plan to extend the original outfall all the way across
    the reef flat and into the open ocean where the predominant current flow would carry
    effluent-mixed waters away from the islet. Ultimately, the extended outfall was
    to be connected to a new sewage treatment facility that would discharge primarily
    treated effluent. Because of a concern that this discharge might adversely impact
    the coral-reef community surrounding the end of the new outfall, a baseline marine
    biological survey was to be conducted prior to start-up of the new sewage treatment
    facility. As planned, the results of this survey would provide a baseline against
    which the results of future surveys could be compared in order to determine whether
    a balanced community of indigenous species had been maintained at the site during
    operation of the facility. If not, conversion to secondary treatment at the facility
    would need to be considered. The first resurvey was planned to occur one year after
    start-up of the new sewage treatment facility with subsequent resurveys planned
    for every five years thereafter. In August 1997, biologists from the U.S. Fish and
    Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) conducted
    the baseline marine biological survey in the vicinity of the Roi-Namur outfall.
    In May 2000, biologists from these agencies returned to Roi-Namur to re-characterize
    the coral-reef habitat and biological organisms at five survey sites in the vicinity
    of the outfall, previously established during the 1997 baseline marine biological
    survey. The purpose of the second survey was to collect data to determine whether
    a balanced community of indigenous species had been maintained at this location
    after the sewage treatment facility became operational. If not, conversion to secondary
    treatment at the facility would need to be considered. For the National Oceanographic
    Data Center, interest in the report focuses on the marine element. Data tables from
    marine surveys of reef fishes, corals, other macroinvertebrates, and algae that
    exist in those habitats are provided.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
