	"notes": "\"We propose a four-year program for the fabrication and characterization of high dynamic range, low background photon counting detectors that will support the next generation of UV\/optical astronomy missions.  These devices will serve as  \n\ntechnology pathfinders for large format detectors ideal for space-flight applications.  Advanced UV\/optical detector systems are essential for addressing NASA's strategic science goals highlighted in the recent Decadal Survey, including a census of the atmospheric properties of extrasolar planets and constraining the physics of reionization in the distant universe.  This program will address these goals through the development and testing of imaging High Event rate ReadOut Integrated Circuits (HEROICs), where independent pixel logic allows sustained count rates of order 1 kHz per pixel when coupled with a microchannel plate detector.  In addition to directly addressing NASA's strategic science goals, this technology will extend the lifetime of UV detectors by operating at a lower gain and enabling a boot-strapping of primary standard stars to fainter magnitudes, both of which address calibration challenges for future high-sensitivity UV instruments.  The proposed program will raise the technology readiness level of these devices from TRL 2 to TRL 4, while developing an architecture that will be compatible with flight applications in NASA's suborbital program.  This technology would then be well-placed for use as a primary science detector on future UV\/optical Explorer-class missions and ultimately large strategic missions such as ATLAST.\"\n",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
