  true,\n\t\"url\": null,\n\t\"notes\": \"Sensors are vital components for control
  and advanced health management techniques. However, sensors continue to be considered
  the weak link in many engineering applications since often they are less reli- able
  than the system they are observing. This is in part due to the sensorsu2019 operating
  principles and their susceptibility to interference from the environment. Detecting
  and mitigating sensor failure modes are becoming increasingly important in more
  complex and safety-critical applications. This paper reports on different techniques
  for sensor fault detection, disambiguation, and mitigation. It presents an expert
  system that uses a combination of object-oriented modeling, rules, and semantic
  networks to deal with the most common sensor faults, such as bias, drift, scaling,
  and dropout, as well as system faults. The paper also describes a sensor correction
  module that is based on fault parameters extraction (for bias, drift, and scaling
  fault modes) as well as utilizing partial redundancy for dropout sensor fault modes).
  The knowledge-based system was derived from the results obtained in a previously
  deployed Neural Network (NN) application for fault detection and disambiguation.
  Results are illustrated on an electromechanical actuator application where the system
  faults are jam and spalling. In addition to the functions implemented in the previous
  work, system fault detection under sensor failure was also modeled. The paper includes
  a sensitivity analysis that compares the results previously obtained with the NN.
  It concludes with a discussion of similarities and differences between the two approaches
  and how the knowledge based system provides additional functionality compared to
  the NN implementation.\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S. Government Work\",\n\t\"extras\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
