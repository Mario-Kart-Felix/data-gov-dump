	"notes": "&lt;p&gt;rntThis project builds from the work of the first year of effort that successfully integrated the Spacesuit&amp;nbsp; Water Membrane Evaporator (SWME), developed by the JSC Engineering Directorate,&amp;nbsp; and&amp;nbsp; the&amp;nbsp; Lithium Chloride Absorber Radiator (LCAR) developed by Creare Inc. as a flexible, bendable system, into a non-venting system for thermal control.&amp;nbsp; This system could be made more advantageous for spacecraft and Portable Life Support Systems (PLSS), from a mass and volume standpoint, by building&amp;nbsp; the structure of the spacecraft or the PLSS housing&amp;nbsp; with high-strength carbon fiber composite honeycomb,&amp;nbsp; the cells of which would be filled with the chemical absorption media.&amp;nbsp; In this way the multifunctional composite element provides structural strength, desiccant storage and the radiator surface area required for heat rejection.&amp;nbsp; A 2 ft2 panel will be constructed and tested in thermal and thermal vacuum conditions.&amp;nbsp; A flight-like regeneration system will also be built and tested. A thermal fluid model will be built and correlated&amp;nbsp; to the test data.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rnt&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntThe entire stack would have a depth of 12 mm, and include the storage stack honeycomb of 8 mm in depth, an internal vapor header, and an external radiator face sheet.&amp;nbsp; In this way, the housing multifunctionally provides the necessary housing protective structure, desiccant storage capacity, and radiator surface to reject the heat. The 8mm depth of storage media suggests more efficient absorption resulting in a potential radiator temperature of 330K.&amp;nbsp; A similar arrangement would be useful in providing a non-venting topping function for orbiting spacecraft during low lunar orbit where both heat rejection requirements and 290 K peak sink temperature are relatively high.&amp;nbsp; Regeneration could be conducted during colder parts of the orbit where there is more available cooling for a condensing heat exchanger.&lt;/p&gt;rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
