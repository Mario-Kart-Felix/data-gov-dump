	"notes": "NextGen Aeronautics, Inc. and their partner, Virginia Tech, propose tondevelop a self-healing material for wire insulation using a class ofnpoly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid) (EMAA) and poly(tetramethylene oxide)nionomer polymers. The self-healing property of these materials isnstrongly correlated with the thermal processes that occur during andnafter damage initiation.  Recent experimental results have demonstratednthat penetration of the polymer by a projectile causes localized heatingnnear the puncture.  The heating then causes a localized melt elasticnresponse which serves to close the puncture and 'heal' the polymer.nSince self-healing has already been demonstrated using these materials,nthe major technical challenge of this STTR effort is to stimulate thenlocalized melt elastic response that has been shown to initiatenself-healing.  Our concept is to incorporate a magnetically-responsenphase into the insulating polymer for the purpose of causing localizednheating during high-frequency excitation of the polymer.  This magneticnphase will be located close to the electrical conductor.  Localizednheating will cause flow into the crack and, upon cooling, the crack willnclose over the wire and eliminate the exposure of the bare wire.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
