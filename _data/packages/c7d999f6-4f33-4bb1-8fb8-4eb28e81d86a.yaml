    potential of meeting transportation requirements, particularly in challenging environments.
    Snakes can traverse a variety of surfaces including hard ground, sandy or rocky
    terrain and can in addition, climb trees and swim through water. Limbless locomotion
    offers several advantages over other more conventional forms of locomotion that
    have been used for space exploration. With the center of gravity close to the ground,
    serpentine robots would be very stable &amp;ndash; for wheeled or legged robots
    on the other hand stability would be a constant concern particularly over uneven
    terrain. Serpentine robots offer the promise of being able to traverse terrain like
    soft soils, rocky terrain and narrow passageways that could defeat wheeled or legged
    robots. As seen in snakes, limbless locomotion isn&amp;rsquo;t restricted to a single
    gait but, in fact, appears in several forms each offering advantages in terms of
    speed, stability, energy consumption and suitability for a particular terrain. The
    entire mechanism for locomotion is contained within the body of the robot. This
    allows better sealing between the mechanism internals and the environment which
    can be a great advantage in hostile environments. In addition limbless locomotion
    offer advantages in terms of mechanism redundancy, small frontal area and large
    surface area in relation to the volume. This can potentially be used to advantage:
    for example to mount solar cells and scientific instruments. The flexibility of
    the mechanism offers other possible uses as well: snake like mechanisms can wrap
    around rocks or burrow into loose sandy soil/rock aggregate to anchor spacecraft
    to asteroids. From the brief literature survey conducted for this proposal, it appears
    that limbless locomotion is a still developing field that offers a whole new world
    of potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntThe ADAMS multibody dynamics software
    package from MSC software is an industry standard tool widely used for analysis
    of mechanical systems.&lt;/p&gt;rn",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
