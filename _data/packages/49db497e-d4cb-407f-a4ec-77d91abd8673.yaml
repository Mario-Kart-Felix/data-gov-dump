    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    measurements of soil moisture within three 25-km by 25-km Meso-cell Study Areas
    (MSAs) in northern Colorado (Fraser, North Park , and Rabbit Ears). Measurements
    were made between September 2001 and April 2003. Spatial and temporal variations
    in soil moisture described by these data may be used to support remotely sensed
    airborne (e.g., Gamma flights) and satellite (e.g., AMSR-E) surveys of soil moisture
    at increasing spatial scales. Gravimetric measurements, as well as some volumetric
    measurements, of soil moisture were made at each measurement site. nnThe NASA Cold
    Land Processes Field Experiment (CLPX) is a multi-sensor, multi-scale experiment
    that focuses on extending a local-scale understanding of water fluxes, storage,
    and transformations to regional and global scales. Within a framework of nested
    study areas in the central Rocky Mountains of the western United States, ranging
    from 1-ha to 160,000 km2, intensive ground, airborne, and spaceborne observations
    are collected. Data collection focuses on two seasons: mid-winter, when conditions
    are generally frozen and dry, and early spring, a transitional period when both
    frozen and thawed, dry and wet conditions are widespread.",nt"owner_org": "d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed",nt"extras":
