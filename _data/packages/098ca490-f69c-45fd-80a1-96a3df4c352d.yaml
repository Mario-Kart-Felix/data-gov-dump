    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    and present challenge in future exploration missions. Significant development is
    called for in the area of devices and structures that tolerate or mitigate the presence
    of lunar dust. Honeybee Robotics seeks to develop a scalable dust-tolerant, autonomous
    utility connector for lunar surface system applications with a focus on small pressurized
    rover recharge. Honeybee has heritage in developing mechanisms for extreme, dusty
    environments. There are many near-term applications of such a connector including:
    the utility and electrical connections that will be used on the next-generation
    lunar EVA suit, cryogenic utility connections that will be used to pass liquid hydrogen
    and liquid oxygen during in-situ resource utilization activities, and high-power
    electrical connectors capable of thousands of cycles for the Lunar Electric Rover
    (LER) battery recharge and data transfer functions. The Phase I program has resulted
    in (1) environmental testing of breadboard lunar dust-tolerant alignment features
    for autonomous utility connections capable of accommodating 120&amp;#730; angular
    and 11.5cm lateral approach misalignment; and (2) a conceptual design that integrates
    the dust-tolerant alignment features with our dust-tolerant electrical connector
    and mechanical connection mechanisms based on lessons learned during environmental
    testing of the alignment feature breadboard. In Phase II, Honeybee will develop
    a prototype autonomous utility connector that integrates the alignment features,
    mechanical connection mechanism and electrical connection mechanism; testing the
    prototype in our lunar Dusty environment Simulation Test chamber that is capable
    of closely reproducing the conditions of the lunar surface.  This effort will lead
    to the development of an autonomous dust-tolerant utility connector to TRL 6 with
    a focused application to the battery recharge connector for the LER being developed
    for the Constellation program.  ",nt"owner_org": "d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed",nt"extras":
