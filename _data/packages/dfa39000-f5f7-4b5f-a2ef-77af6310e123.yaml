    system, from False Cape, Virginia, to Cape Lookout, North Carolina, has been studied
    by a cooperative research program that mapped the Quaternary geologic framework
    of the estuaries, barrier islands, and inner continental shelf. This information
    provides a basis to understand the linkage between geologic framework, physical
    processes, and coastal evolution at time scales from storm events to millennia.
    The study area attracts significant tourism to its parks and beaches, contains a
    number of coastal communities, and supports a local fishing industry, all of which
    are impacted by coastal change. Knowledge derived from this research program can
    be used to mitigate hazards and facilitate effective management of this dynamic
    coastal system. This regional mapping project produced spatial datasets of high-resolution
    geophysical (bathymetry, backscatter intensity, and seismic reflection) and sedimentary
    (core and grab-sample) data. The high-resolution geophysical data were collected
    during numerous surveys within the back-barrier estuarine system, along the barrier
    island complex, in the nearshore, and along the inner continental shelf. Sediment
    cores were taken on the mainland and along the barrier islands, and both cores and
    grab samples were taken on the inner shelf. Data collection was a collaborative
    effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and several other institutions
    including East Carolina University (ECU), the North Carolina Geological Survey,
    and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS). The high-resolution geophysical
    data of the inner continental shelf were collected during six separate surveys conducted
    between 1999 and 2004 (four USGS surveys north of Cape Hatteras: 1999-045-FA, 2001-005-FA,
    2002-012-FA, 2002-013-FA, and two USGS surveys south of Cape Hatteras: 2003-003-FA
    and 2004-003-FA) and cover more than 2600 square kilometers of the inner shelf.
    Single-beam bathymetry data were collected north of Cape Hatteras in 1999 using
    a Furuno fathometer. Swath bathymetry data were collected on all other inner shelf
    surveys using a SEA, Ltd. SwathPLUS 234-kHz bathymetric sonar. Chirp seismic data
    as well as sidescan-sonar data were collected with a Teledyne Benthos (Datasonics)
    SIS-1000 north of Cape Hatteras along with boomer seismic reflection data (cruises
    1999-045-FA, 2001-005-FA, 2002-012-FA and 2002-013-FA). An Edgetech 512i was used
    to collect chirp seismic data south of Cape Hatteras (cruises 2003-003-FA and 2004-003-FA)
    along with a Klein 3000 sidescan-sonar system. Sediment samples were collected with
    a Van Veen grab sampler during four of the USGS surveys (1999-045-FA, 2001-005-FA,
    2002-013-FA, and 2004-003-FA). Additional sediment core data along the inner shelf
    are provided from previously published studies. A cooperative study, between the
    North Carolina Geological Survey and the Minerals Management Service (MMS cores),
    collected vibracores along the inner continental shelf offshore of Nags Head, Kill
    Devils Hills and Kitty Hawk, North Carolina in 1996. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
    collected vibracores along the inner shelf offshore of Dare County in August 1995
    (NDC cores) and July-August 1995 (SNL cores). These cores are curated by the North
    Carolina Geological Survey and were used as part of the ground validation process
    in this study. Nearshore geophysical and core data were collected by the Virginia
    Institute of Marine Science. The nearshore is defined here as the region between
    the 10-m isobath and the shoreline. High-resolution bathymetry, backscatter intensity,
    and chirp seismic data were collected between June 2002 and May 2004. Vibracore
    samples were collected in May and July 2005. Shallow subsurface geophysical data
    were acquired along the Outer Banks barrier islands using a ground-penetrating radar
    (GPR) system. Data were collected by East Carolina University from 2002 to 2005.
    Rotasonic cores (OBX cores) from five drilling operations were collected from 2002
    to 2006 by the North Carolina Geological Survey as part of the cooperative study
    with the USGS. These cores are distributed throughout the Outer Banks as well as
    the mainland. The USGS collected seismic data for the Quaternary section within
    the Albemarle-Pamlico estuarine system between 2001 and 2004 during six surveys
    (2001-013-FA, 2002-015-FA, 2003-005-FA , 2003-042-FA, 2004-005-FA, and 2004-006-FA).
    These surveys used Geopulse Boomer and Knudsen Engineering Limited (KEL) 320BR Chirp
    systems, except cruise 2003-042-FA, which used an Edgetech 424 Chirp and a boomer
    system. The study area includes Albemarle Sound and selected tributary estuaries
    such as the South, Pungo, Alligator, and Pasquotank Rivers; Pamlico Sound and trunk
    estuaries including the Neuse and Pamlico Rivers; and back-barrier sounds including
    Currituck, Croatan, Roanoke, Core, and Bogue.",nt"owner_org": "bd2cdd5a-4d65-46c0-9937-c8381175f104",nt"extras":
