		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

	"notes": "In this STTR project Scientific Systems Company, Inc. (SSCI) and  Brigham Young University (BYU) propose to  design, implement, and test an  Autonomous Coordinated Control And Management System (ACCAMS) for multiple Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) engaged in cooperative missions under rapidly changing environment. Over the past few years, BYU has developed an effective approach for complex cooperative missions such as the coordinated multiple UAV rendezvous mission. In this project we plan to enhance this approach by integration of Failure Detection, Identification, and Reconfiguration (FDIR) algorithms, Achievable Dynamic Performance  (ADP) estimation  algorithms, and high level decision making logic to the control architecture.  The integration of these  algorithms allow the UAVs to make intelligent decisions in the presence of subsystem failures or external threats in an autonomous fashion. The FDIR algorithms detect and identify the failure when it occurs, and reconfigures the controller to continue the mission if possible.  It also estimates the new ADP and pass this information to the upper layers to decide if the trajectory/path/mission need to be changed after the failure or threat has occurred.  We also plan to conduct flight tests of the baseline  coordinated control scheme to demonstrate the path planning and trajectory generation capabilities using the  BYU  fixed-wing UAV testbed during Phase I.rn",
