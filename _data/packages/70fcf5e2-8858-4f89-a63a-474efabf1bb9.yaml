    null,nt"notes": "The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files
    (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from
    the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
    Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless
    national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File
    is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to
    cover the entire nation. The primary legal divisions of most States are termed counties.
    In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties,
    the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, and municipalities,
    and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively
    for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four States
    (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places
    that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions
    of their States. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are
    treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of
    Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent
    entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following
    entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios
    in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth
    of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire
    area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties
    or equivalent entities. The 2010 Census boundaries for counties and equivalent entities
    are as of January 1, 2010, primarily as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary
    and Annexation Survey (BAS).<br /><br /> This table contains data on language ability
    and linguistic isolation from the American Community Survey 2006-2010 database for
    counties. Linguistic isolation is defined as no one 14 and over speaks English only
    or speaks English "very well". The American Community Survey (ACS) is a household
    survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that currently has an annual sample size
    of about 3.5 million addresses. ACS estimates provides communities with the current
    information they need to plan investments and services. Information from the survey
    generates estimates that help determine how more than $400 billion in federal and
    state funds are distributed annually. Each year the survey produces data that cover
    the periods of 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year estimates for geographic areas in the
    United States and Puerto Rico, ranging from neighborhoods to Congressional districts
    to the entire nation. This table also has a companion table (Same table name with
    MOE Suffix) with the margin of error (MOE) values for each estimated element. MOE
    is expressed as a measure value for each estimated element. So a value of 25 and
    an MOE of 5 means 25 +/- 5 (or statistical certainty between 20 and 30). There are
    also special cases of MOE. An MOE of -1 means the associated estimates do not have
    a measured error. An MOE of 0 means that error calculation is not appropriate for
    the associated value. An MOE of 109 is set whenever an estimate value is 0. The
    MOEs of aggregated elements and percentages must be calculated. This process means
    using standard error calculations as described in "American Community Survey Multiyear
    Accuracy of the Data (3-year 2008-2010 and 5-year 2006-2010)". Also, following
    Census guidelines, aggregated MOEs do not use more than 1 0-element MOE (109) to
    prevent over estimation of the error. Due to the complexity of the calculations,
    some percentage MOEs cannot be calculated (these are set to null in the summary-level
    MOE tables).<br /><br /> The name for table 'ACS10LANCNTYMOE' was added as a prefix
    to all field names imported from that table. Be sure to turn off 'Show Field Aliases'
    to see complete field names in the Attribute Table of this feature layer. This can
    be done in the 'Table Options' drop-down menu in the Attribute Table or with key
    sequence '[CTRL]+[SHIFT]+N'. Due to database restrictions, the prefix may have been
    abbreviated if the field name exceded the maximum allowed characters.",nt"license_title":
