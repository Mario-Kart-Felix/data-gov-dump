	"notes": "As the MegaFlex solar array is scaled for power demands greater than 50kW over the next 20 years and deployed load requirements remain high or increase, advanced MegaFlex blanket support spar designs will be desired. The spars are the structural members that support the MegaFlex solar array deployed blanket.  When the solar array experiences a deployed load, the structural load path starts in the spars which carry the load to the hub assembly that then pass it on to the latched panel assemblies that act as the structural back-bone of the deployed array and carry the load to the solar array to spacecraft interface. Therefore as the MegaFlex blanket areas increase the spar loading increases which causes higher stress levels in the spars, unless they are appropriately scaled in size. However directly scaling the spars in size from their current design state is not the most optimized design for strength and mass. This is why AD proposes to develop a hierarchical set of MegaFlex spar designs with ATK. rnrnSuccessful performance of this proposed strategic plan has far reaching benefits which start with the scaling risk reduction of larger future MegaFlex solar arrays to support power demands beyond 50kW with high deployed loading requirements. The benefits continue with mass savings for these arrays obtained by the mass optimized future spars which will enable more payload for future HEOMD or other missions and or launch cost savings. Finally, development costs for future flight qualification of a MegaFlex solar array &gt;50kW in size with high deployed loading requirements will be saved because this work will already have been completed. All of these benefits support future HEOMD missions and others, which therefore further validates the merit of the proposed innovation and work to be completed on this SBIR.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
