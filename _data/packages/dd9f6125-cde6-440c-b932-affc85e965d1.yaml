    live captured sea otters and liver samples from beach-cast sea otter carcasses off
    the remote Washington coast indicate relatively low exposure to contaminants, but
    suggest that even at the low levels measured, exposure may be indicated by biomarker
    response. Evidence of pathogen exposure is noteworthy - infectious disease presents
    a potential risk to Washington sea otters, particularly due to their small population
    size and limited distribution. During 2001 and 2002, 32 sea otters were captured,
    of which 28 were implanted with transmitters to track their movements and liver
    and blood samples were collected to evaluate contaminant and pathogen exposure.
    In addition, liver samples from fifteen beach-cast animals that washed ashore between
    1991 and 2002 were analyzed to provide historical information and a basis of reference
    for values obtained from live otters. The results indicate low levels of metals,
    butyltins, and organochlorine compounds in the blood samples, with many of the organochlorines
    not detected except polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and a few aromatic hydrocarbons
    detected in the liver of the live captured animals. Aliphatic hydrocarbons were
    measurable in the liver from the live captured animals; however, some of these are
    likely from biogenic sources. A significant reduction of vitamin A storage in the
    liver was observed in relation to PCB, dibutyltin and octacosane concentration.
    A significant and strong positive correlation in vitamin A storage in the liver
    was observed for cadmium and several of the aliphatic hydrocarbons. Peripheral blood
    mononuclear cell (PBMC) cytochrome P450 induction was elevated in two of 16 animals
    and may be potentially related to aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon exposure. Mean
    concentration of total butyltin in the liver of the Washington beach-cast otters
    was more than 15 times lower than the mean concentration reported by Kannan et al.
    (1998) for Southern sea otters in California. Organochlorine compounds were evident
    in the liver of beach-cast animals, despite the lack of large human population centers
    and development along the Washington coast. Concentrations of PCBs and chlordanes
    (e.g., trans-chlordane, cis-chlordane, trans-nonachlor, cis-nonachlor and oxychlordane)
    in liver of Washington beach-cast sea otters were similar to those measured in Aleutian
    and California sea otters, excluding those from Monterey Bay, which were higher.
    Mean concentrations of 1,1,1,-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophyenyl)ethanes (DDTs) were
    lower, and mean concentrations of cyclohexanes (HCH, e.g., alpha BHC, beta BHC,
    delta BHC and gamma BHC) were slightly higher in Washington beach-cast otters versus
    those from California and the Aleutians. Epidemiologically, blood tests revealed
    that 80 percent of the otters tested positive for morbillivirus and 60 percent for
    Toxoplasma, the latter of which has been a significant cause of mortality in Southern
    sea otters in California. This is the first finding of positive morbillivirus titers
    in sea otters from the Northeast Pacific. Despite the high frequency of detection
    of morbillivirus and Toxoplasma in the live otters, cause of death of stranded Washington
    sea otters generally has not been attributable to either morbillivirus or Toxoplasma.
    Washingtonu2019s sea otter population continues to grow, with over 1100 animals
    currently inhabiting Washington waters; however, the rate of growth has slowed over
    recent years. The population has a limited distribution and has not yet reached
    its carrying capacity and as such, is still considered at high risk to catastrophic
    events.",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
