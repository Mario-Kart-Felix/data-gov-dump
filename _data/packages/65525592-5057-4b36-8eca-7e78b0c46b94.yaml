    beyond low earth orbit (LEO) face a difficult thermal control challenge: they are
    required to reject a high heat load to warm orbital environments and a low heat
    load to cold transit environments, necessitating a quite high turn-down ratio. This
    difficult challenge can be transformed into a tractable design problem for arbitrarily
    high turn-down ratios through the use of shape memory alloys, materials that exhibit
    a temperature dependent phase change such that they can be easily deformed below
    the transition and recover a predefined shape above the transition. In fact, shape
    memory alloys can be trained to behave in a two-way manner so that it takes one
    shape above and another below the transition temperature. Such materials make possible
    a passively deployed heat rejection device which adjusts vehicle and environment
    loads based on its operating temperature alone. This project seeks to train a shape
    memory material and evaluate its behavior.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntThis project trained
    a shape memory material to behave in a two-way manner and evaluated the capability
    of the two-way shape memory effect. A literature review identified an optimum training
    method involving alternating constrained and unconstrained thermal cycles. The effect
    of two bending strain rates were investigated through training rigs of differing
    radii, both trained in parallel. It was identified that in both cases cold working
    of the material results in some deformation to the austinite shape. This cold work
    deformation can be addressed through careful design of the hot set shape of the
    material.The results indicate that the greatest delta between austinite and martensite
    shapes is obtained through the lesser training strain (large radius rig). Projection
    of the results of two-way training of the material indicate that sufficient deformation
    can be trained to successfully employ in a full sized heat rejection device.&lt;/p&gt;rn",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
