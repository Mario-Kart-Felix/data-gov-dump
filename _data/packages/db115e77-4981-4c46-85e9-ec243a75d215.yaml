    studied extensively by NASA in the context of water recovery from wastewater. However,
    the Water Recovery System and Urine Processor Assembly currently used in the International
    Space Station can only recover as much as 90&#37; of the water (Carter, 2009). Complete
    dewatering is not possible for these technologies since they are not designed for
    handling solids and processing is stopped before precipitates form. The only water
    recovery process that can handle solids is the Air Evaporation System (AES) which
    uses porous rayon wicks but its performance is severely limited by its low thermal
    conductivity and susceptibility to microbial growth. We propose to improve on the
    AES by designing an evaporation system using thermally conductive porous media.
    The high surface area and porosity of these porous media coupled with the use of
    vapor-compression distillation results in a novel system that can recover almost
    100&#37; of the water at the desired purity with high energy efficiency and minimal
    consumables.rnrnMakel Engineering and Cornell University are proposing the use of
    two processes, (1) freeze-concentration and (2) porous media evaporation, to produce
    water that meets electrolysis purity requirements needed for oxygen production from
    lunar regolith. While freeze-concentration systems have been shown to be effective
    in purifying water for terrestrial applications, we believe that our proposed process
    is the first to power the freezing-melting cycle by a thermoelectric heat pump.
    Our innovative system will exploit the property of thermoelectrics to reverse their
    heating and cooling sides, leading to the reuse of the enthalpy of fusion and simple
    equipment design.  In principle, our process will operate at high energy efficiency,
    recover more than 99&#37; of the water from the feed at the desired purity, and
    use no consumables.rn",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
