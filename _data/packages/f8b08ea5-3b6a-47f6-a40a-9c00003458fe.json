	"notes": "Abstract: The Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) is a sensorn                carried onboard the Landsat 7 satellite and has acquired images of the Earth nearlyn                continuously since July 1999, with a 16-day repeat cycle. Landsat ETM+ image datan                consist of eight spectral bands (band designations), with a spatial resolution of 30n                meters for bands 1 to 5 and band 7. Resolution for band 6 (thermal infrared) is 60n                meters and resolution for band 8 (panchromatic) is 15 meters. Approximate scene sizen                is 170 km north-south by 183 km east-west (106 mi by 114 mi). The Level 0R datan                product is reformatted raw data. Reformatting involves shifting pixels by integern                amounts to correct for three effects: 1) the alternating forward-reverse scanningn                pattern of the Landsat ETM+ sensor; 2) the odd-even detector arrangement within eachn                band; and 3) the detector offsets inherent in engineering design of the focal planen                array. Pixels in L0R images are not resampled, nor are they geometrically correctedn                or registered, which means that the pixels are NOT aligned per scan line. The Level 1T (L1T)n                data product provides systematic radiometric accuracy, geometric accuracy byn                incorporating ground control points, while also employing a Digital Elevation Modeln                (DEM) for topographic accuracy. Geodetic accuracy of the product depends on then                accuracy of the ground control points and the resolution of the DEM used.n            ",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
