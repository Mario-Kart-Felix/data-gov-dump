    Dry Tortugas, FL by National Ocean Service scientists from the Center for Coastal
    Habitat and Fisheries Research (CCFHR) during 2009 aboard the NOAA Ship Nancy Foster.
    The overall objective of CCFHR's research in the Tortugas is to examine the effects
    of implementation of the Tortugas North Ecological Reserve (TNER). The establishment
    of the TNER, a no-take reserve, in 2001 provided the opportunity to examine the
    response of the fish and benthic communities to the creation of a refuge for exploited
    reef fishes. Historically, exploitation of reef fishes in the Tortugas has focused
    on large predatory reef fishes, primarily snappers and groupers and, to a lesser
    extent, grunts. Trends in populations of these targeted species are expected to
    vary relative to geographic variation in fishing mortality (F). Increasing trends
    in targeted species abundance are expected in the TNER where all fishing was prohibited
    in 2001. Within adjacent areas managed as the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), where
    both federally sanctioned commercial and recreational fisheries are permitted, exploited
    populations are expected to be depressed relative to those in the TNER. Within the
    Dry Tortugas National Park (DTNP) where fishing effort is limited to recreational
    hook and line fishing, trends in exploited species are expected to be intermediate
    to those observed in the TNER and EEZ. Cascading effects due to change in abundance
    of exploited species is expected to indirectly impact corals and other sessile benthic
    communities. Sampling to detect reserve implementation effects was conducted at
    the ecotone between the reef habitat of the banks and the surrounding soft-bottom
    shelf where the structure and composition of communities should provide sensitive
    indicators of a reserve effect. Energy flow across reef-sand boundaries is critical
    to reef communities. Energy and nutrients are imported to the reef by nocturnally
    foraging reef fish that feed in sand, algae, and seagrass flats adjacent to the
    reef. The majority of the TNER (approximately 70%) consists of soft-bottom shelf
    habitat, and previous work on the west Florida shelf suggests that benthic primary
    production is the major energy source supporting fish biomass. In addition to providing
    ecologically sensitive sampling locations, the interface between bank and shelf
    provided a distinct landscape feature suited to a comparative analysis of management
    impact. Observations were made using 1) a stratified-random survey design for scuba
    divers visual observations, 2) a systematic survey of fish and fauna using scientific
    splitbeam echosounders (fisheries sonar) to map fish densities and biomass on the
    shelf, coral and softbottom habitats.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
