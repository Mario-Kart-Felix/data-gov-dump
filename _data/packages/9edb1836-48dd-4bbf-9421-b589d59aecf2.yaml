    "["Use Constraints: There are several limitations to this dataset and it is important
    they be carefully considered for each particular application. 1. The differences
    between county areas classified as agricultural land in the NLCDe 92 and in the
    1992 county file of agricultural pesticide use (Thelin, 2005) can cause errors in
    the estimated distribution of use. The areas of agricultural land in the 1992 county
    agricultural pesticide use are based on the 1992 Census of Agriculture (surveys)
    while the areas of agricultural land in the NLCDe 92 are based primarily on satellite
    imagery. For counties in which there are temporal and/or areal discrepancies between
    the two primary data sources, the probability of error increases in the pesticide
    grids. Ideally, mapped agricultural land identified by the actual crop grown rather
    than groups of crops (such as row crops, small grains, etc.) would be used with
    the pesticide information by crop, and the information on pesticide application
    and mapped cropland would correlate within the same time period. 2. The limitations
    from each type of data used to develop this dataset are inherited in the pesticide
    grids: a) Please refer to Thelin and Gianessi (2000) for more information related
    to the limitations of the county pesticide use estimates. An example of a limitation
    of the county-level pesticide use data is the non-disclosure of some census crop
    information to protect the identity of individual farmers (U.S. Department of Commerce,
    1995). Another limitation to consider is that state pesticide-use coefficients (average
    annual application rates and percent of a crop's acres in a state treated with a
    pesticide) are gathered from surveys and reports covering a 4-year period (Gianessi
    and Anderson, 1995). The total amount of pesticide use by county, as determined
    from the pesticide grids, closely match the total amount of county pesticide use
    from Thelin's (2005) source data (the majority of the differences is less than 1
    kg). Therefore, the grids reflect the pesticide use from the source county data
    correctly at the county scale. However, when sub-county areas (such as small watersheds)
    are evaluated, the potential for error for estimating pesticide use increases. b)
    The National Land Cover Dataset 1992 (NLCD 92) is subject to misclassification of
    agricultural land in some areas despite the extensive use of ancillary information
    (Vogelmann and others, 2001). (For additional information related to accuracy assessment
    of the NLCD, see http://landcover.usgs.gov/accuracy/index.php). The pesticide use
    grid dataset incorporates an enhanced version of the NLCD 92 which includes reclassification
    in some areas based on U.S. Geological Survey's Land Use and Land Cover dataset
    of the 1970 and 1980's. Classification of agricultural land is further complicated
    by farmland that is used for multiple crops, or left fallow. 3) The limitations
    described in #1 and #2 above can cause some grid-cell values (estimated pesticide
    application) to be unrealistically high. For example, in a few counties in Texas,
    where much of the pasture lands appear to be classified as "shrubland" in the
    NLCDe 92, tens of thousands of kilograms of 2,4-D are distributed amongst the very
    small areas classified as "pasture/hay". 4) Conversely, the limitations described
    in #1 and #2 can also cause underestimation of pesticide use in areas where, for
    instance, grasslands are misclassified as "pasture/hay". In these counties, the
    amount of pesticides are distributed over the areas that may truly be a mix of grasslands
    and pastured land, which result in a low pesticide use intensity. In addition, this
    "dilution" effect is introduced in the 875 counties in which the CGF areas served
    to substitute ORCH areas due to the absence of land classified as ORCH. 5) During
    the process of converting the 30-m resolution ORCH grids to 1-km resolution percentage
    grids, a very small area of orchards were "lost" in two counties: Tallamook in
    Oregon and Gloucester in Virginia. (The Federal Information Processing Standard
    (FIPS) codes for these counties are 41057 and 51073, respectively). The few 30-m
    grid cells classified as orchards/vineyards in these 2 counties lie along the county
    boundary, and because the centroid of the respective 1-km grid cells fell outside
    of the boundaries for these 2 counties, the GIS software did not include them in
    the conversion process from 30-m to 1-km resolution. The absence of ORCH grid cells
    in the 1-km representation resulted in the loss of pesticide use on orchards/vineyards
    in these 2 counties, as summarized below: Pesticide (Code)-----------FIPS----------KG
    Azinphos methyl (6004)--51073-------3.00 Captan (5014)-------------41057-------2.98
    Captan (5014)-------------51073-------8.05 Copper (5011)-------------41057-------6.70
    Mancozeb (5000)----------51073-------6.13 Metiram (5029)------------51073-------4.9
    Oil (6049)------------------41057-------7.78 Oil (6049)------------------51073-------36.22
    Sulfur (5004)---------------51073-------17.14 Ziram (5016)---------------51073--------5.61
    6) The grid cells in all 199 agricultural pesticide grids are zero in 42 counties
    and statistically equivalent entities ("county equivalents"). The majority of
    these 42 counties and county equivalents are individual cities that comprise mostly
    of urban land use (and therefore indicative of little or no agricultural pesticide
    use). The amount of agricultural pesticide use in these 42 counties and county equivalents
    are not excluded in the pesticide grids but rather combined with its adjacent or
    surrounding county. The counties and county equivalents that have pesticide use
    combined with its adjacent or surrounding county are: COUNTY STATE NAME OF COUNTY
