    were derived from the recently published North American Carbon Program (NACP) Regional
    Synthesis 1-degree terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) and inverse model (IM) outputs
    (Gridded 1-deg Observation Data and Biosphere and Inverse Model Outputs, Wei et
    al., 2013). The first product is the aggregation of the standardized gridded 1-degree
    TBM and IM outputs to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory zones as defined for North
    America (United States, Canada, and Mexico). Depending on the data availability,
    the monthly/yearly Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Net Primary Production (NPP), Total
    Vegetation Carbon (VegC), Heterotrophic Respiration (Rh), and Fire Emissions (FE)
    outputs from the 22 TBM and 7 IM models were aggregated from the 1-degree resolution
    gridded format to the inventory zones and then, further divided into Forest Lands,
    Crop Lands, and Other Lands sectors within each inventory zone based on the 1-km
    resolution GLC2000 land cover map (GLC2000, 2003).The second product is the North
    American national GHG inventories on the scale of inventory zones which contain
    estimated land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 (NEE) in forest lands, crop lands, and
    other lands sectors. NEE estimates were synthesized from inventory-based data on
    productivity, ecosystem carbon stock change, and harvested product stock change,
    and additional information from national-level GHG inventories of the United States,
    Canada, and Mexico including EPA (2011) and Environment Canada (2011).An additional
    summary file of annual mean NEE (2000-2006)is provided for both land sectors and
    reporting zones in North America and was created by combining the aggregated model
    output and the national GHG database and is provided. The aggregated monthly and
    yearly model output data and the national GHG inventories data are available in
    comma separated value (*.csv) format files. Also provided are detailed inventory
    zone spatial data as an ESRI Shapefile. Included are zone names, boundaries, and
    zone and land cover type area attributes. For mapping convenience, the inventory
    zones shapefile was merged with 1-km forest, crop, and other lands masks to create
    a 1-km resolution reference data file that was converted to GeoTIFF format. The
    GeoTIFF defines to which inventory zone and land cover type each 1-km grid cell
    belongs.This document provides detailed information about the content, format, and
    processing procedures of these two data products. Detailed descriptions of the TBMs
    and IMs can be found in a separate companion document: NACP Regional Synthesis -

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
