    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;rntThe optical design of RAISE
    is based on a new class of UV/EUV imaging spectrometers that use&amp;nbsp; only
    two reflections to provide quasi-stigmatic performance simultaneously over multiple
    wavelengths&amp;nbsp; and spatial fields. Figure 5 summarizes the RAISE instrument
    design, showing photographs of each of&amp;nbsp; the components or subsystems. The
    design uses an off-axis parabolic telescope mirror to form a real&amp;nbsp; image
    of the sun on the spectrometer entrance aperture. A slit then selects a portion
    of the solar image,&amp;nbsp; passing its light onto a near-normal incidence toroidal
    grating, which re-images the spectrally dispersed&amp;nbsp; radiation onto two array
    detectors. Two full spectral passbands over the same one-dimensional spatial&amp;nbsp;
    field are recorded simultaneously with no scanning of the detectors or grating.
    The two different spectral&amp;nbsp; bands (1st-order 1205-1243&amp;Aring; and 1526-1564&amp;Aring;)
    are imaged onto two intensified Active Pixel Sensor&amp;nbsp; (APS) detectors whose
    focal planes are individually adjusted for optimized performance. The telescope&amp;nbsp;
    and grating are coated with B4C to enhance short wavelength (2nd order) reflectance
    (Fig. 6), enabling the&amp;nbsp; instrument to record the brightest lines between
    602-622&amp;Aring; and 761-780&amp;Aring; at the same time. Table 1&amp;nbsp; summarizes
    the main optical parameters for RAISE. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rnt&lt;strong&gt;TVLS
    Grating. &lt;/strong&gt;The single toroidal variable line space (TVLS) grating has
    a toroidal surface&amp;nbsp; (Sagittal Radius = 640.5 mm, Tangential Radius = 635.3
    mm), with varied line space (VLS) rulings of the&amp;nbsp; type developed originally
    for spherical substrates by Kita, Harada, and collaborators (1983, 1995). By&amp;nbsp;
    combining this VLS concept with toroidal surfaces, RAISE is the first to exploit
    this new class of&amp;nbsp; spectrometers, as described by Thomas (2003). For RAISE,
    the grating is placed 400 mm behind the slit,&amp;nbsp; with focus at a distance
    of approximately 1700 mm, for a spectrometer magnification of 4.25. By&amp;nbsp;
    operating at high magnification, the RAISE spectrometer most effectively utilizes
    the full length and&amp;nbsp; width available in the sounding rocket payload. The
    first RAISE grating, mechanically ruled by Bach&amp;nbsp; Research, Inc., was delivered
    in August 2007 and tested for figure, ruling density and total grating&amp;nbsp;
    efficiency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rnt&lt;strong&gt;Intensified APS Cameras&lt;/strong&gt;.
    The RAISE Intensified APS camera systems are 1k x 1k CMOS Active&amp;nbsp; Pixel
    Sensors using miniature digital camera electronics and fed by an MCP intensifier.
    APS cameras&amp;nbsp; were chosen for RAISE (rather than CCDs) because of their
    extremely fast readout, direct digital output,&amp;nbsp; low mass, low power, deep
    full well and high radiation tolerance. The RAISE cameras were developed at&amp;nbsp;
    DLR (Germany) using a Cypress/Filfactory Star 1000 APS and include a 12-bit external
    ADC and USB&amp;nbsp; 2.0 interface. We will operate the cameras at 5-10 frames/sec
    readout, making dark current negligible&amp;nbsp; compared to the incoming signal.
    The complete camera electronics including its controller is integrated&amp;nbsp;
    on only one printed circuit board, and uses a rigid-flex 3D-interconnection between
    the boards to form a&amp;nbsp; lightweight, compact sensor head. Flight detectors
    were delivered by DLR in August 2008.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rnt&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RAISE
    Chromospheric Slit Jaw Camera (SJC)&amp;nbsp; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;To co-align
    the RAISE spectra with observations from SDO, HINODE, and IRIS, and to collect&amp;nbsp;
    chromospheric disk images in C IV and the continuum between 1500-1700 &amp;Aring;,
    the solar image at the&amp;nbsp; telescope focal plane (spectrograph entrance slit
    plane) is re-imaged onto a SJC mounted on the bottom&amp;nbsp; side of the optical
    bench. The slit plane is tilted 5 degrees to reflect incident light onto a pair
    of flat relay&amp;nbsp; mirrors that fold the light down through the optical bench
    to a re-imaging system mounted to the bottom&amp;nbsp; side of the optical bench,
    through a 200 &amp;Aring; wide interference filter centered at 1600 &amp;Aring;,
    and then onto an&amp;nbsp; intensified APS camera identical to those discussed above.
    The SJC re-images the 4&amp;#39; x 16&amp;#39; region of the&amp;nbsp; slit plane
    onto the camera with 4.25:1 magnification (matching the magnification of the spectrograph)
    for&amp;nbsp; an image plate scale of 1.0&amp;quot;/pixel.&amp;nbsp; The primary
    purpose of the RAISE Slit Jaw Camera (SJC) is to provide co-alignment context images&amp;nbsp;
    for the spectroscopic observations with those from other ground and space-based
    platforms. The&amp;nbsp; relatively broad passband (1600 &amp;plusmn; 100&amp;Aring;)
    SJC image consists of largely chromospheric continuum and a&amp;nbsp; large contribution
    (20&#37; of the signal in the quiet-Sun) from the C IV line at 1550&amp;Aring; and
    provide &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;nbsp; loop&amp;rdquo; and evolving supergranular context
    for the spectral observations discussed above. The SJC&amp;nbsp; observations will
    also enable us to actively study the connection, if any, of broad-frequency spectrum&amp;nbsp;
    oscillations in the chromosphere, how they dynamically interact with the magnetic
    fields that thread the&amp;nbsp; line of sight of the spectrograph slit and how
    they connect to the spectroscopic signals in the upper&amp;nbsp; chromosphere, transition
    region and low corona (e.g., McIntosh &amp;amp; Poland 2004).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;rn",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
