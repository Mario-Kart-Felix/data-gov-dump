	"notes": "LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology plays important roles in NASA's space missions. Specifically in KSC's launch vehicles operations, break-through in LIDAR technology could provide ability to economically measure incremental ballistic wind velocities along the predicted trajectory of launch vehicles at remote.  rnThe most critical component in a LIDRA is its laser scanner, which delivers laser pulse to target with desirable field of view (FOV).  Most of existing LIDARs uses rotating or oscillating mirror for scanning, resulting in several drawbacks:rn? Large size of moving parts (mirrors and motors), limiting scanning speed to hundreds HZ; rn? Difficult to meet stringent requirements on size, weight, and power for space uses;rn? Difficult to control FOV of scanning motion;rn? Un-evenness of data point distribution due to inherent acceleration of scanning mirror;rn? Waste points at the swath borders of scanning mirror.  rn     tIn this SBIR, we propose a revolutionary LIDAR scanning technology  that could eliminate these drawbacks and achieve very high scanning speed, with an ultra-miniature size, much lighter weight and much compact size. This novel technology promises at least a 10x performance improvement in these areas over existing LIDAR scanners.rnInnovations of the proposed ultra-miniature LIDAR scanner include:rn? Ultra miniature size of scanner: it is possible to make the entire scanner in &lt;2 mm in diameter;rn? Very high scanning speed (e.g. 5~20 kHz, contrast to several hundred Hz in existing scanners);rn? Ideal structure to meet stringent requirements on size, weight, power, and compactness for various space applications;rn? The scanning speed and field of view (FOV) can be dynamically adjusted: suited for obtaining high image resolutions of targeted areas and for diversified uses.rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
