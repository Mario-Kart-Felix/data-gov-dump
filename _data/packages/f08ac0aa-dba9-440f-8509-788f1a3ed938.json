	"notes": "NASA seeks Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) for Earth science data collection for missions with variable durations, operating proximities, altitudes, and environmental conditions. Of particular interest is the Ice Bridge mission, which takes observations in support of Arctic and Antarctic research by identifying ice sheet motion, three-dimensional ice features, and other atmospheric and surface effects. These UAS aircraft may be equipped with a variety of sensors, with each aircraft potentially completing a unique set of objectives, only some of which take advantage of or require distributed sensing. Such a flexible system demands that vehicles be capable of seamless entry and exit of aircraft from any distributed sensing task. The approach proposed here satisfies these needs through a distributed sensing architecture that allows cluster sensor information to interface with and influence a multi-aircraft, high-precision, closed-loop path planning and control system. In addition, the UAS path planner is capable of managing dynamic flight regimes, including high winds and turbulence, while ensuring proper target tracking. This combination of features maximizes mission utility and path repeatability.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
