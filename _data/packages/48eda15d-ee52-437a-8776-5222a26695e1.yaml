    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The design concepts being considered for
    Heatshield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET) rely on the use of 3D
    woven carbon fiber preforms.  Therefore, there is a need to be able to predict the
    properties and performance of a woven material.  Validation of predictive modeling
    tools would allow for the use of these tools to design and optimize the 3D weaves,
    significantly reducing the cost of fabrication and testing of a variety of configurations.
     While there are proven tools for the prediction of laminate composite properties,
    textile composites are relatively new materials and much less effort has been focused
    on modeling this class of materials.rnTherefore, MR&amp;D is proposing to use the
    lessons learned from the Phase I effort, to improve the strength prediction capabilities,
    evaluate the effects of porosity and molding of curved panels, and deliver a beta
    version of a 3D weave design optimization tool. A combined analytical and experimental
    program has been proposed.  The analytical effort involves modifying the current
    version of the 3D weave modeling tool, based on the lessons learned in the Phase
    I program, to include things such as unique bundle strengths for the different yarn
    types and improved failure criteria to improve the strength prediction capabilities.
     It also includes increasing the current capabilities to allow for estimating properties
    of 3D woven composites with varying levels of porosity or that have been molded
    into curved panels.  The experimental effort involves fabrication and testing of
    various 3D woven reinforced composites (flat, curved, partially densified).  The
    properties obtained from this experimental effort will enable improved calibration
    of the modeling tools.  Finally, the final portion of the Phase II effort will focus
    on the preparation of a beta version of the 3D weave design optimization tool for
    delivery to NASA for use in heat shield design as well as other applications requiring
    the use of 3D woven preforms.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
