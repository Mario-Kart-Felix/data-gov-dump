    period of observation in 1983 was 642 walruses. This included 249 adult males (38.8%),
    203 adult females (31.6%), and 190 calves (29.6%). For the purposes of this report,
    adult refers to any walrus older than a calf and does not refer to reproductive
    maturity. Of the 452 adult walruses, males comprised 55.1% and females 44.9%. The
    sex distribution of the harvest during 1983 was significantly different from both
    1981 (chi-square .01 <P<.025) and 1982 (chi-square P<.001). The proportions of both
    males and calves were higher and the proportion of females lower in 1983 than both
    1981 and 1982 (Table 1). The two most successful hunting days were 18 and 24 May,
    accounting for 151 (23.5%) and 205 (31.9%) walruses respectively. During the 8 day
    interval including 18 through 24 May, 468 walruses were landed. This was 72.9% of
    the total catch (Table 2). The total harvest in 1983 was only about two thirds as
    large as either 1981 or 1982. Two factors are primarily responsible for this: poor
    weather and an extended whaling season. Wind in excess of 15 knots is usually sufficient
    to prevent bunting from boats. Early during the observation period, especially during
    the last 2 weeks of April, very few days were calm enough to launch boats. In addition,
    the wind was out of the north much of the winter and spring. Gambell hunters speculated
    that all the ice that was driven south either melted in deep water south of the
    shelf break or drifted back to the north far east of St. Lawrence Island. Whatever
    the cause, proper conditions of sufficient ice for walrus hunting did not persist
    near Gambell. Hunting methods were also affected by the quota system initiated by
    the International Whaling Commission. As Gambell hunters were only allowed 2 bowhead
    strikes in 1983, most whale captains felt obliged to use both strikes. Whaling continued
    many days after walrus bunting would normally have begun. Perhaps 2 weeks of very
    productive walrus bunting was lost during early May.",nt"license_title": "License
