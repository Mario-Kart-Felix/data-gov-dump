    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;This project made use of two computational
    photography techniques, high dynamic range (HDR) imagery formulation and bilateral
    filters to enable novel imaging applications in support of developing a low light
    level imaging capability to improve imagery. HDR imaging is a technique that generates
    an image with a greater dynamic range than ordinarily achievable given an imaging
    system&amp;rsquo;s hardware architecture. &amp;nbsp;HDR images are generated by
    acquiring multiple images of the same scene at different exposure settings. Each
    individual image contains a collection of properly exposed pixels and pixels that
    are both dark (underexposed) and saturated (overexposed). HDR image products are
    generated by combining multiple frames of data at different exposure times such
    that the darkest areas within a frame are imaged with the longest exposure time
    and the brightest areas within a frame are imaged with the shortest exposure time.&amp;nbsp;
    This technique can be very powerful when processing imagery acquired under low light
    level conditions. &amp;nbsp;Standard imagery acquired under low light often contains
    a significant number of pixels that are extremely dark whereby information content
    is lost in the shadows. Bilateral filters reduce the noise in relatively uniform
    areas within an image while minimizing blurring of edges and other spatial features.
    Edge preserving noise reduction filters are important for improving the imagery
    of poorly lit scenes. These filters can be used to improve the quality of imagery
    acquired under low light level conditions. This type of filter preserves edges by
    only allowing pixels with&amp;nbsp;similar radiometric values to be included in
    the spatial filter. By looping through each pixel within an image and assigning
    weights to adjacent pixels, the entire image is processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However,
    implementation of the bilateral filter can be computationally intensive, so alternative
    algorithms that rely on approximations were developed. The bilateral filter described
    above was implemented in Matlab&amp;reg; and a simple simulated edge target image
    was constructed to functionally test the algorithms. For both sets of images noise
    levels (2&#37; and 4&#37;), and the bilateral filter results were more pronounced
    as light level and image quality decreased. By using these two computational photography
    techniques, representative HDR image products with imagery acquired under extreme
    low light conditions were successfully produced.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
