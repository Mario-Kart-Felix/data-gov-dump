	"notes": "The Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry (ATSDR) Hazardous Waste Site Polygon Data with CIESIN Modifications, 1996 is a database providing georeferenced data for 1562 National Priorities List (NPL) Superfund sites. These were selected from the larger set of the GRASP Hazardous Waste polygon boundary database, based on NPL site identification numbers provided by EPA for 2008, but excluding 7 sites in 4 US Territorial areas plus the now independent Palau, Federated States of Micronesia. There are 72 NPL sites for which there are no corresponding ATSDR polygons. The database includes all the attributes for these NPL sites provided in the ATSDR GRASP Polygon database and the EPA CERCLIS NPL database. The Hazardous Waste Site ATSDR layer was created by linking HAZ_SITES_ATSDR_BASE with additional data. Most polygons represent sites considered for cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund). Typical sites are either on the EPA National Priorities List (NPL) or are being considered for inclusion on the NPL.This dataset is modified and distributed by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN). (Suggested Usage: To provide an easily accessible, corrected dataset of polygons for hazardous waste sites in the United States which can be used to identify nearby populations and assess their potential risk.)",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
