    "Comet Hitchhiker: Harvesting Kinetic Energy from Small Bodies to Enable Fast and

    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;This idea can be intuitively understood
    by the analogy of fishing. Imagine a fisherman on a small boat tries to catch a
    big fish that runs at a high relative speed. Once the fish is on a hook, the experienced
    fisherman would let the line go while applying a moderate tension on it, instead
    of holding it tightly. If the line has a sufficient length, the boat can eventually
    catch up with the fish with moderate acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concept
    brings three novel capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Fuel-less landing and orbit
    insertion. We estimate that a comet hitchhiker spacecraft can obtain up to ~10 km/s
    of delta-V by using a carbon nanotube (CNT) tether. This level of delta-V enables
    a spacecraft to land on/orbit around long-period comets and Kuiper belt objects
    (KBOs), which have not been even visited by any spacecraft yet. With existing technologies
    only a fly-by is realistic for these targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Non-gravitational
    slingshot around small bodies. A comet hitchhiker can obtain ~5 km/s of additional
    delta-V by utilizing just 25&#37; of the harvested energy for reeling in the tether
    and/or driving electric propulsion engines. The tether is detached from the target
    after the desired delta-V is obtained. Our concept enables to design a fast trajectory
    to a wide range of destinations in the Solar System by taking full advantage of
    the high relative velocity, abundance, and orbital diversity of small bodies. For
    example, by hitching a comet with q=0.5 AU, a comet hitchhiker can reach the current
    orbital distance of Pluto (32.6 AU) in 5.6 years and that of Haumea (50.8 AU) in
    8.8 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Deep space energy production. Assuming 25&#37; efficiency
    of regenerative brake, a 2-ton comet hitchhiker can produce ~25 GJ of energy, which
    is sufficient to drive an instrument with 1 kW power consumption over 290 days.
    If future storage device can achieve the energy density of gasoline, 25 GJ can be
    stored in 500 kg of mass, making it a potential energy source in the outer Solar
    System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science missions enabled by the comet hitchhiker concept
    are not only intellectually exciting but also crucial to achieve a NASA&amp;rsquo;s
    strategic goals to &amp;quot;ascertain the content, origin and evolution of the
    Solar System.&amp;quot; Three particular examples of such missions are 1) exploration
    of primitive bodies, which preserve the chemical composition at the formation of
    the Solar System, 2) in-depth observation of KBOs, and 3) mapping of the distribution
    of interplanetary dust particles. All of the three science missions require a level
    of delta-V in deep space that is impractical or extremely costly using currently
    available technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our concept brings important advantages
    over a related concept of tether-based flyby, which uses a fixed length of tether
    in order to change the direction of the relative velocity like gravity assist. This
    concept cannot be used for landing and orbit insertion because it does not reduce
    the relative speed. The comet hitchhiker concept is distinct in that it reels out
    a tether while applying regenerative brake force to accelerate itself, and at the
    same time, to harvest energy. This approach allows the spacecraft to match its velocity
    with that of the target, and as a result, enables soft landing on and orbit insertion
    around unexplored bodies such as long-period comets and KBOs. We strongly believe
    that the comet hitchhiker concept will advance the frontier of space exploration
    to the most exotic worlds in the Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
