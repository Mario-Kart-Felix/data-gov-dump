    Encoding and Referencingn          (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents
    a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line
    shapefile isn          designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they
    can be combined to cover the entire nation.  The Census Bureau includes landmarks
    in the MTDB forn          locating special features and to help enumerators during
    field operations.  Some of the more common landmark types include area landmarks
    such as airports,n          cemeteries, parks, mountain peaks/summits, schools,
    and churches and other religious institutions.  The Census Bureau has added landmark
    features to MTDB onn          an as-needed basis and made no attempt to ensure that
    all instances of a particular feature were included.  The presence or absence of
    a landmark such as an          hospital or prison does not mean that the living
    quarters associated with that landmark were geocoded to that census tabulation block
