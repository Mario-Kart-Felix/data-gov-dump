	"notes": "Smart lighting systems in low energy commercial buildings can be expensive to implement and commission. Studies have also shown that only 50% of these systems are used after installation, and those used are not operated at full capacity due to inadequate commissioning and lack of personalization. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have great potential to enable personalized smart lighting systems for real-time model predictive control of integrated smart building systems. In this paper we present a framework for using a WSN to develop a real-time indoor lighting inverse model as a piecewise linear function of window and artificial light levels, discretized by sub-hourly sun angles. Applied on two days of daylight and ten days of artificial light data, this model was able to predict the light level at seven monitored workstations with accuracy sufficient for daylight harvesting and lighting control around fixed work surfaces. The reduced order model was also designed to be used for long term evaluation of energy and comfort performance of the predictive control algorithms. This paper describes a WSN experiment from an implementation at the Sustainability Base at NASA Ames, a living laboratory that offers opportunities to test and validate information-centric smart building control systems.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
