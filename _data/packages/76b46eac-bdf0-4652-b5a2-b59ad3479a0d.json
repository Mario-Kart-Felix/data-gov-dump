	"notes": "The purpose of this study was to map all salt marshes along the coastline of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, from the Canning River to the Canadian border. These salt marshes are found on the northern coast of the Arctic NWR, along the shores of the Beaufort Sea. The diurnal fluctuations of tides and wave action or seasonal fluctuations of storm surges creates a band of halophytic vegetation along coastlines and estuaries. This type of vegetation is referred to as salt marsh. Because of their geomorphic position, salt marshes receive influxes of nutrients from both land and sea, making them highly productive systems. Also because of their low elevation, at the interface of land and sea, they are the first land systems to be affected by marine disturbances both natural and manmade.Along the Beaufort Sea coastline the salt marsh zone is narrow. Tidal fluctuations, although present, are minimal 0.15m, Meyers 1985 and effects of storm surges are mitigated by the ice pack. This restricts salt marshes to those areas that have minimal relief and are low enough to be affected by minor fluctuations in sea water level. As a result, salt marshes are unevenly distributed along the coast, and occupy only a small fraction of the total coastal area. In relation to other wetlands of the coastal plain, Bergmann et al. 1977 estimated that this vegetation type covered only 3 of all wetlands at Storkersen Point in the Prudhoe Bay area. In the Arctic NWR, salt marshes mapped for this project covered only 2140 ha of the 2.4 million ha coastal plain.Although the salt marsh zone is narrow and patchy on the landscape, it is disproportionally used by waterfowl during the summer months. It is of greatest value to large waterfowl, mostly brant but also white fronted geese, widgeon, and tundra swans for feeding and nesting Bergman et al. 1977, by snow geese as brood rearing habitat, and as staging habitat for several shorebird species Martin and Moitoret 1981, Burgess et al. 1992. Jefferies 1977 found that arctic salt marshes were important feeding sites for migrating eider, pintail, mallards and oldsquaw. Salt marshes are also used by caribou for grazing and as insect avoidance habitat Taylor 1978.Taylor 1981 recognized five coastal habitat types: gravelly beaches, raised beaches, coastal dunes, coastal bluffs and salt marshes. He then divided salt marshes into two zones. The first was a tidal salt marsh, the seaward limit of which is controlled by mean high water. It is found along gently sloping shorelines and lagoons. There are three main plant associations in this habitat type: Puccinellia phryganoides, Carex subspathacea Puccinellia phryganoides, and Carex ramenskiiC. subspathacea. The second type of salt marsh is an upper storm zone community, between the limits of normal and maximum tidal activity. This type is dominated by Dupontia fisheri var. psilosantha.",
