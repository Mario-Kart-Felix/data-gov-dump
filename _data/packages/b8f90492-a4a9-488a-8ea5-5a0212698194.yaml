  measurements of NPP components for 39 old-growth tropical forests distributed worldwide
  between latitudes 23.58 N and 23.58 S. The data were compiled from published literature
  and other extant sources. The data are georeferenced to each intensive study site
  and include above- and below-ground biomass, fine root biomass, litterfall, branchfall,
  above-ground biomass increment, and herbivory estimates, where available. Other
  site characteristics are included, such as elevation, forest type and age, soil
  type, and climate summaries. Key references are provided. Estimates of above-ground
  net primary productivity (ANPP) for the 39 sites were made based on the sum of (1)
  measured or estimated above-ground biomass increment, (2) measured or estimated
  fine litterfall accumulation, (3) estimated losses to consumers, and (4) estimated
  biogenic volatile organic compound emissions. Estimates of below-ground NPP were
  made based on professional judgment that below-ground production is 0.2 x ANPP (lower
  bounds) or 1.2 x ANPP (upper bounds). TNPP was calculated as the range between the
  low and high values of ANPP + BNPP. Average BNPP and TNPP estimates were also calculated.
  Across the broad spectrum of the tropical forests studied (dry to wet, lowland to
  montane, nutrient-rich to nutrient-poor soils), the estimates of total NPP range
  from 3.4 to 34.4 Mg/ha/yr (lower bounds) and from 6.2 to 63.0 Mg/ha/yr (upper bounds).
  There is one comma-separated data file (.csv) with this data set. The ORNL DAAC
  [http://daac.ornl.gov] NPP Collection for tropical forests contains additional biomass
  and NPP component estimates and climate data for 28 of the intensive study sites
  in this data set. Revision Notes: Only the documentation for this data set has been
  modified. The data files have been checked for accuracy and are identical to those
  originally published in 2001. \",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S. Government Work\",\n\t\"extras\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
