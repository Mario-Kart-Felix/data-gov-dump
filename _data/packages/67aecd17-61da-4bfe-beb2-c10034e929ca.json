	"notes": "Sediment samples from three mainstem and seven tributary sites in the Clinch River Basin were analyzed for 21 organochlorine compounds, 19 metals, total volatile sulfides, total organic carbon, and particle size distribution. None of the organochlorine compounds were detected in any samples, and molybdenum was detected at only two sites. Aluminum, boron, barium, beryllium, chromium, vanadium, total volatile sulfides, and total organic carbon were highest at one tributary site (Copper Creek, Site 12). The highest mercury concentration was found at another location (Site 10) on Copper Creek. The highest concentrations for copper and manganese (Site 4), and selenium and strontium (Site 8) were found at two mainstem sites. Geometric means for 11 metals in the tributary site samples were within about 20% of those for mainstem sites. Barium, beryllium, copper, lead, manganese, nickel, selenium and strontium averages were higher for the mainstem sites. No statistical differences between mainstem and tributary site means were noted using log-transformed, dry-weight results normalized to 1% total organic carbon. Total volatile sulfides were considered elevated at Sites 3 and 11, and highly elevated at Site 12. Each of these sites was also considered heavily polluted based on total volatile sulfides. Manganese concentrations (geometric means) in tributary and mainstem sites were substantially greater than that found in surficial soils of the eastern United States. Tributary and mainstem manganese concentrations were also slightly higher than that reported for East Fork Poplar Creek, an impacted stream near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Chromium was considered extremely elevated at Site 12 (Copper Creek), and was in the same range as that reported for East Fork Poplar Creek. Chromium at Site 12 also exceeded the sediment limit of tolerance developed by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (OME). Cadmium and zinc were typically below OME's no effect levels. Copper, iron and mercury were generally below OME's lowest effect levels. Mercury, cadmium, and zinc concentrations were below sediment concentrations associated with reduced survival of rainbow trout early life stages. Cadmium and mercury were also below sediment concentrations associated with reduced amphipod and chironomid survival. Copper, lead, nickel and zinc concentrations were in ranges associated with reduced amphipod and chironomid survival in 10-day sediment toxicity tests. Chromium, manganese, mercury and other metals in Copper Creek sediments may be impacting species known to occur in the creek that have been listed pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. Two listed fish species, three listed mussel species, and one mussel species proposed for listing as endangered have been found in Copper Creek. The following items are recommended for consideration in any future investigations of the Clinch River: 1) analyze sediment samples for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, 2) analyze sediment samples for acid volatile sulfide and simultaneously extracted metals, 3) use a suite of appropriate sediment toxicity tests, including larval and juvenile mussels; 4) measure contaminants in water and sediment in conjunction with toxicity tests, 5) conduct cholinesterase inhibition assays with non-listed mussel species, and 6) determine contaminant residues in nonlisted mussel species which are co-located with listed species.",
