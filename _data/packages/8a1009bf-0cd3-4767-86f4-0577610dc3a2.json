	"notes": "The 2015 TIGER Geodatabases are extracts of selected nation based and state based geographic and cartographic information from then                    U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) database. The geodatabasesn                    include feature class layers of information for the fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island areas (American Samoa, the n                    Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the United States Virgin Islands). The geodatabases do not contain any sensitive data. The n                    2015 TIGER Geodatabases are designed for use with Esriu00e2u0080u0099s ArcGIS. n                n                    The STATENAME geodatabase contains multiple layers. These layers are the Block, Block Group, Census Designated Place, Census Tract, County Subdivision andn                    Incorporated Place layers.n                                       n                    Block Groups (BGs) are clusters of blocks within the same census tract. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numberedn                    within census tracts.  BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the samen                    decennial census.  For example, tabulation blocks numbered 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within census tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within thatn                    census tract.  BGs coded 0 are intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, andn                    Great Lakes water areas. Block groups generally contain  between 600 and 3,000 people.  A BG usually covers a contiguous area but never crossesn                    county or census tract boundaries. They may, however, cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urbann                    areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas.  The BG boundaries in this releasen                    are those that were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.  n                    n                    The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back ton                    previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.n                    When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and livingn                    conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused byn                    highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due ton                    population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiablen                    features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations ton                    allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State andn                    county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract mayn                    consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entitiesn                    that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts thatn                    include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized Americann                    Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained littlen                    or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrialn                    park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.  n                    n                    An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD),n                    which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a state,n                    but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can haven                    other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineatedn                    to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the staten                    in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coinciden                    with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennialn                    census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarilyn                    have the same boundary.  The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.  n                    n                    The boundaries of most incorporated places in this shapefile are as of January 1, 2013, as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary andn                    Annexation Survey (BAS).  Limited updates that occurred after January 1, 2013, such as newly incorporated places, are also included.  The boundariesn                    of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.n                    n                    The primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties.  In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes.  In Alaska, which has non                    counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas.  Then                    latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.  In four states (Maryland, Missouri,n                    Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primaryn                    divisions of their states.  These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of datan                    presentation.  The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of datan                    presentation.  The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerton                    Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virginn                    Islands.  The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.  The boundaries forn                    counties and equivalent entities are mostly as of January 1, 2013, primarily as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary andn                    Annexation Survey (BAS).  However, some changes made after January 2013, including the addition and deletion of counties, are included.n                    n                    County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and their equivalent entities for the reporting of Census Bureau data. They includen                    legally-recognized minor civil divisions (MCDs) and statistical census county divisions (CCDs), and unorganized territories.  For the 2010 Census,n                    the MCDs are the primary governmental and/or administrative divisions of counties in 29 States and Puerto Rico; Tennessee changed from having CCDsn                    for Census 2000 to having MCDs for the 2010 Census.  In MCD States where no MCD exists or is not defined, the Census Bureau creates statisticaln                    unorganized territories to complete coverage.  The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas are covered by countyn                    subdivisions.  The boundaries of most legal MCDs are as of January 1, 2013, as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Surveyn                    (BAS). The boundaries of all CCDs, delineated in 21 states, are those as reported as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areasn                    Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.n                    n                    For the 2010 Census, subMCDs only exist in Puerto Rico.  In Puerto Rico the subMCDs are termed subbarrios and are legally defined subdivisions ofn                    the minor civil division (MCD) named barrios-pueblo and barrios. The boundaries of the subbarrios are as of January 1, 2010 and were provided to then                    Census Bureau by the Puerto Rico Planning Board.                  n                ",
