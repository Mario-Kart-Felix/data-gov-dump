	"notes": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge is charged with managing wildlife and wildlife habitat, both during and following cleanup of contaminants. This management includes mitigation for damage to existing wildlife habitats due to cleanup activities being conducted by the U.S. Army, Shell Oil Company, and their respective contractors. Most damages are mitigated under the Terrestrial Restoration Program, an umbrella program for mitigation and restoration of grasslands that is sanctioned by the Remediation Venture Office. The Service proposes to restore 14.5 acres of crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), and downy brome (Bromus tectorum) in the northeastern corner of Section 29. These species have marginal value for wildlife. This restoration will establish native vegetation on the exposed soils and replace the cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum and Bromus japonicas) and crested wheatgrass with native grasses, forbs, and shrubs having greater value to songbirds, small mammals, and other Refuge wildlife. Crested wheatgrass and weedy areas will be eliminated by deep plowing prior to seeding. Some small stands of existing native western wheatgrass (Pascopyron smithii) will be identified and preserved. Side-roll and solid-set irrigation systems will be installed to ensure success of the plantings. Weeds will be controlled by mowing and herbicide applications. In addition, about 2 acres located in the far northeastern corner of Project 29-04 adjacent to the section line will be seeded to shrubs. These seedings will consist of various spring seeding trials utilizing different compositions of grasses, forbs and shrubs in 200\u2019 x 200\u2019 plots. (Please refer to \u2018Shrub Seeding\u2019 in the \u201cMethods\u201d section of this restoration plan for detail on how work will be implemented and scheduled.) The Service will be responsible for seedbed preparation, weed control, and seeding operations. Foster Wheeler Environmental Corporation will be responsible for mulching operations and all irrigation tasks and implementation.  The objectives of this project are: (1) To restore portions of northeastern Section 29, currently dominated by exotic plant species, to a native perennial grassland community which has greater value to songbirds, small mammals, and other Refuge wildlife, and (2) Implement different spring shrub seeding field trials in order to determine which grass\/shrub seed mixtures show the greatest potential for use as vegetative barriers to prairie dogs near caps and covers.",
