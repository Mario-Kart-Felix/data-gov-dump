    with 3x3 meter cell size representing the slope (in degrees) of several deep coral
    priority areas off the Atlantic Coast of Florida, derived from data collected in
    November 2010. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with
    NOAA vessel Ron Brown, as well as federal, university, and private sector partners,
    acquired multibeam bathymetry data off the Atlantic Coast of Florida from the Lost
    Coast Explorer on 10/28/2010 to 10/31/2010. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted
    Kongsberg EM 710 multibeam echosounder (70 kHz). It was processed by a NOAA contractor
    using CARIS HIPS software. Attitude and sound velocity correctors applied to the
    data. Verified tides were not applied to the data, leaving the depth values referenced
    to the ellipsoid. The imagery is projected in the UTM Zone 17 north, NAD83 datum.
    The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath
    angle. The CARIS Export option "BASE Surface to Image" was then used to create
    a GeoTiff of the priority areas. Slope was derived from this surface using the slope
    calculator, a function of ESRI's Spatial Analyst extension.",nt"owner_org":
