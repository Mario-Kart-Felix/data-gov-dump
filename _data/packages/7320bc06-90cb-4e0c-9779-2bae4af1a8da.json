	"notes": "We studied diurnal activity and habitat use patterns of waterfowl on Swan Lake in Calhoun County, IL during fall and spring migrations 1992-93. Swan Lake, a 1,255 ha backwater lake near the confluence of the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers (Pool 26), was selected as a site for a Habitat Rehabilitation and Enhancement Project (HREP) under the Upper Mississippi River system Environmental Management Program. This study was conducted to obtain baseline data on waterfowl use of Swan Lake for comparison with results of post-project evaluations. Swan Lake was used primarily as a resting area during fall and spring migration; waterfowl populations peaked in early November, and in late February to mid-March. Dabbling ducks included mostly mallards (Anas platyrhyncos) , while lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) and ring-necked ducks (Aythya collaris) comprised the majority of diving ducks. Geese consisted mainly of snow geese (Chen caerulescens). Divers were observed mostly in open water habitat during fall (98%) and spring (70%). Moist soil habitats received little use by waterfowl during fall, but 21-54% of geese, dabblers and divers were observed there in spring. Dabbling ducks made the greatest use during fall (44%) of near-shore habitats that were exposed at low lake levels in summer. Overall, resting was the predominant activity of waterfowl during fall and spring migration, but feeding activity increased in habitats where aquatic macroinvertebrates and macrophytes were more abundant. Less than 10% of ducks were observed feeding in open water habitats, but 64-70% were observed feeding in submerged aquatic and moist soil habitats during fall. Very little feeding was observed among diving ducks in spring, but 28% of dabblers were observed feeding in moist soil and near-shore emergent habitats. If installation of levees and water control structures, combined with implementation of effective water level management, enhances aquatic plant and invertebrate communities, habitat conditions will improve for waterfowl. Waterfowl populations should respond numerically (increased use-days) and/or functionally (increased feeding and residence times) to increased availability of food and cover.",
