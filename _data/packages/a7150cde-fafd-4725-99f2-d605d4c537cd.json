	"notes": "This report covers the acute toxicity studies conducted with samples collected from Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge. The objective of these studies was to investigate the potential acute toxicity of agricultural drain water entering Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge to freshwater fish and invertebrates. Drain water was collected by Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge personnel from four sites (Pintail Bay, Lead Lake, Hunter Drain, and TJ Drain) and shipped to the National Fisheries Contaminant Research Center (NFCR) for acute effluent toxicity testing. In addition, dilution test water was obtained from a reference site (Lahontan Lake) near Stillwater NWR. Both freshwater and saltwater cultured/acclimated fish and invertebrates were used to assess the acute toxicity of these effluents. The use of both freshwater and saltwater organisms allowed for the separation of toxic effects due to salinity from the toxic effects of additional contaminants associated with the agricultural irrigation water entering Stillwater NWR. Water collected from Pintail Bay was acutely toxic to both freshwater and saltwater cultured/acclimated fish and invertebrates; water from TJ Drain was toxic only to the freshwater cultured animals and saltwater cultured D. magna. The toxicity of Pintail Bay effluent was probably a function of both inorganic contamination and elevated salinity. The toxicity of TJ Drain effluent was probably more directly related to salinity. The toxic mechanism occurring within complex chemical mixtures cannot always be identified on the basis of single-compound toxicity-values because of possible interactions among the major identified and unidentified contaminants. Additional studies are needed using reconstituted mixtures of principal chemical components to identify key toxicants and their interactions with other mixture constituents.",
