    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Various instruments are used to create images
    of the Earth and other objects in the universe in a diverse set of wavelength bands
    with the aim of understanding natural phenomena. Sometimes these instruments are
    built in a phased approach, with additional measurement capabilities added in later
    phases. In other cases, technology may mature to the point that the instrument offers
    new measurement capabilities that were not planned in the original design of the
    instrument. In still other cases, high resolution spectral measurements may be too
    costly to perform on a large sample and therefore lower resolution spectral instruments
    are used to take the majority of measurements. Many applied science questions that
    are relevant to the earth science remote sensing community require analysis of enormous
    amounts of data that were generated by instruments with disparate measurement capabilities.
    This paper addresses this problem using Virtual Sensors: a method that uses modelstrained
    on spectrally rich (high spectral resolution) data to "fill in" unmeasured spectral
    channels in spectrally poor (low spectral resolution) data. The models we use in
    this paper are Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with
    Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels and SVMs with Mixture Density Mercer Kernels
    (MDMK). We demonstrate this method by using models trained on the high spectral
    resolution Terra MODIS instrument to estimate what the equivalent of the MODIS 1.6
    micron channel would be for the NOAA AVHRR/2 instrument. The scientific motivation
    for the simulation of the 1.6 micron channel is to improve the ability of the AVHRR/2
    sensor to detect clouds over snow and ice. ",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
