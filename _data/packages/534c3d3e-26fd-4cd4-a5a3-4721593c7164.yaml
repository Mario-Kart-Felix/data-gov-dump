    bathymetry of a reef shelf/bank and the steep canyons and slopes of the NE Reserve,
    offshore of Fajardo, Puerto Rico. The M-I907-NF-13 survey was split into two sites:
    W00247 in the west and W00246 in the east. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team,
    in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private
    sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the Northeast Grand Reserve
    from 3/05/2013 to3/29/2013. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsburg Em 1002
    echosounder (95 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software.
    Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced
    to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data
    is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The backscatter component of the bathymetry
    data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using Hypack 2012 acquisition
    software. The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards,
    dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate
    the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.",nt"license_title":
