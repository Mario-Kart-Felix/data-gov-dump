	"notes": "A tandem pair of Advanced Land Imager (ALI) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scenes covering the same part of Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa (including the Skukuza tower site and rest camp), were acquired about a minute apart on May 30, 2001. The ALI is one of three instruments aboard NASA's first New Millennium Program Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) satellite. ALI is a technology validation testbed that employs novel wide-angle optics and a highly integrated multispectral and panchromatic spectroradiometer.The tandem pair was produced to evaluate the differences between ALI and ETM+ and determine if technology similar to that of the ALI is suitable for future land imaging that will continue the observations begun by the Landsat satellites in 1972.The ALI and ETM+ images are false color composites combining shortwave infrared, near infrared, and visible wavelengths, displayed as red, green, and blue, respectively. Dense vegetation appears green. The similarity of the images demonstrates the ability of the ALI to produce data comparable to ETM+. Several SAFARI 2000 field campaigns conducted in KNP provided ground-based data needed to evaluate measurements from the satellite sensors.Each band is stored as an individual binary file. A metadata file accompanies each set of ALI and ETM+ band files to document the path and row number, sample and line counts, band file names, and sun azimuth and elevation angles. There is also a calibration parameter file that was used for 1R processing.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
