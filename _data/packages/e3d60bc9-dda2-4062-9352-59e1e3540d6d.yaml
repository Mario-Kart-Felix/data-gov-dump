    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The proposed work focuses on implementing
    fast-response pressure-sensitive paint and Surface Stress Sensitive Films for measurements
    of unsteady pressure and skin friction in rotorcraft applications. Significant rotorcraft
    problems such as dynamic stall, rotor blade loads in forward flight, and blade-vortex
    interaction all have significant unsteady pressure oscillations that must be resolved
    in order to understand the underlying physics. Often these unsteady pressures are
    difficult to resolve in the rotating frame due to difficult installation of pressure
    transducers, and data is available only at discrete points. Pressure-sensitive paint
    formulations have been developed to provide surface pressure information in situations
    such as this, but conventional PSP formulations have slow response times. Conventional
    skin friction measurements, for example oil flow, do not offer significant frequency
    response. In order to improve the frequency response characteristics of PSP, sprayed
    porous paint binders have been developed for measurement of unsteady pressures.
    Fast-responding Surface Stress Sensitive Films provide both quantitative skin friction
    and qualitative flow visualization measurements. These techniques can provide high-spatial-resolution,
    time-resolved pressure and skin friction information that will provide unparalleled
    insight into the physical mechanisms driving certain rotorcraft problems. Both of
    these techniques will be demonstrated in Ohio State's unique 6"x22" transonic
    wind tunnel, where an airfoil may be tested for dynamic stall simulation in compressible
    flow. Successful demonstration of fast-responding PSP and S3F on a dynamic stall
    test in the 6"x22" tunnel will serve as a proof of concept that will allow transition
    of the technologies into larger-scale wind tunnels at NASA and elsewhere. ",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
