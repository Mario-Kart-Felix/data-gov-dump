    (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japann                        satellite mission to monitor
    tropical and subtropical precipitationn                        and to estimate its
    associated latent heating. TRMM was successfullyn                        launched
    on November 27, at 4:27 PM (EST) from the Tanegashima Spacen                        Center
    in Japan.n                        n                        The TRMM Microwave Imager
    (TMI) is a nine-channel passive microwaven                        radiometer, which
    builds on the heritage of the Special Sensorn                        Microwave/Imager
    (SSM/I) instrument flown aboard the Defensen                        Meteorological
    Satellite Program (DMSP) platforms. Microwave radiationn                        is
    emitted by the Earth&apos;s surface and by water droplets withinn                        clouds.
    However, when layers of large ice particles are present inn                        upper
    cloud regions - a condition highly correlated with heavyn                        rainfall
    - microwave radiation tends to scatter at frequencies aboven                        19
    GHz. The TMI detects radiation at five frequencies chosen ton                        discriminate
    among these processes, thus revealing the likelihood ofn                        rainfall.
    The key to accurate retrieval of rainfall rates by thisn                        method
    is the deduction of cloud precipitation consistent with then                        radiation
    measurement at each frequency. The TMI frequencies aren                        10.65,
    19.35, 37 and 85.5 GHz (dual polarization), and 21 GHzn                        (vertical
    polarization only).n                        n                        The TMI Gridded
    Oceanic Rainfall Product, also known as TMI Emission,n                        consists
    of 5 degree by 5 degree monthly oceanic rainfall maps usingn                        TMI
    Level 1 data as input. Statistics of the monthly rainfall,n                        including
    number of samples, standard deviation, goodness-of-fit (ofn                        the
    brightness temperature histogram to the lognormal rainfalln                        distribution
    function) and rainfall probability are also included inn                        the
    output for each grid box. Spatial coverage is between 40 degreesn                        North
    and 40 degrees South owing to the 35 degree inclination of then                        TRMM
    satellite.n                        n                        TMI brightness temperature
    histograms at 1 degree intervals aren                        generated based on
    the 19, 21 and 19-21 GHz combination channelsn                        obtained from
    the Level 1B (calibrated brightness temperature) TMIn                        product.
    Monthly rainfall indices over the ocean are derived byn                        statistically
    matching monthly histograms of brightness temperaturesn                        with

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
