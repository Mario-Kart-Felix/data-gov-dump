	"notes": "A key component of NASA's human exploration programs is a system that monitors the health of the crew during space missions. The wearable beat-to-beat blood pressure monitor proposed by Linea Research Corporation can be used to continuously monitor the physiological effect of prolonged space missions (including exposure to reduced gravitational environments) and the effectiveness of its countermeasures. During Phase I of the program, we demonstrated the feasibility of a novel, non-invasive beat-to-beat blood pressure monitor using a lightweight (&lt;40 g) and low-power (&lt;100mA @ 5V) initial prototype. Measurement of beat-to-beat blood pressure was successfully verified during human studies (tilt table tests) using a cuff-based blood pressure monitor as reference. Measurement of the beat-to-beat blood pressure was also verified against an arterial line in animal (porcine) studies using epinephrine to induce blood pressure changes. During Phase II of the program, we will develop and fabricate a field-capable, light-weight, wearable beat-to-beat blood pressure monitor that will be ready for demonstration on space missions. In addition to supplying the blood pressure monitors for use by NASA, Linea plans to introduce the technology for use in ambulatory blood pressure monitors. Linea will subsequently introduce the technology for integration into high acuity as well as home based blood pressure monitors. One patent has been filed and three are currently being prepared to protect the intellectual property. A business plan has been prepared to address the commercialization opportunities.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
