    for the geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore of Bolinas map area, California.
    The vector data file is included in "Faults_OffshoreBolinas.zip," which is accessible
    from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreBolinas/data_catalog_OffshoreBolinas.html.
    The Offshore of Bolinas map area straddles the right-lateral transform boundary
    between the North American and Pacific plates and is cut by several active faults
    that cumulatively form a distributed shear zone, including the San Andreas Fault,
    the eastern strand of the San Gregorio Fault, the Golden Gate Fault, and the Potato
    Patch Fault (Bruns and others, 2002; Ryan and others, 2008). These faults are covered
    by sediment (mostly unit Qms) with no seafloor expression, and are mapped using
    seismic-reflection data (see field activities S-8-09-NC and L-1-06-SF). The San
    Andreas Fault is the primary plate-boundary structure and extends northwest through
    the southern part of the map area before passing onshore at Bolinas Lagoon. This
    section of the San Andreas Fault has an estimated slip rate of 17 to 24 mm/yr (U.S.
    Geological Survey, 2010), and the devastating Great 1906 California earthquake (M
    7.8) is thought to have nucleated on the San Andreas a few kilometers south of this
    map area offshore of San Francisco (e.g., Bolt, 1968; Lomax, 2005). The San Andreas
    Fault forms the boundary between two distinct basement terranes, Upper Jurassic
    and Lower Cretaceous melange and graywacke sandstone of the Franciscan Complex to
    the east, and Late Cretaceous granitic and older metamorphic rocks of the Salinian
    block to the west. Franciscan Complex rocks (unit KJf, undivided) form seafloor
    outcrops adjacent to the shoreline southeast of Stinson Beach that are commonly
    continuous with onshore coastal outcrops. Faults were primarily mapped by interpretation
    of seismic reflection profile data (see field activities S-8-09-NC and L-1-06-SF).
    The seismic reflection profiles were collected between 2006 and 2009. References
