    files (.dbf) are an extract of selectedn          geographic and cartographic information
    from the U.S.Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
    Encoding and Referencingn          (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents
    a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line
    shapefile isn          designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they
    can be combined to cover the entire nation.n          n         Alaska Native Regional
    Corporations (ANRCs) were created pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement
    Act (ANCSA), which is federal legislationn         (Pub. L. 92-203, 85 Stat. 688
    (1971); 43 U.S.C. 1602 et seq. (2000)) enacted in 1971, as a "Regional Corporation"
    and organized under the laws of the State ofn         Alaska to conduct both the
    for-profit and non-profit affairs of Alaska Natives within a defined region of Alaska.
     For the Census Bureau, ANRCs are consideredn         legal geographic entities.
     Twelve ANRCs cover the entire state of Alaska except for the area within the Annette
    Island Reserve (a federallyn         recognized American Indian reservation under
    the governmental authority of the Metlakatla Indian Community).  A thirteenth ANRC
    represents Alaska Natives whon         do not live in Alaska and do not identify
    with any of the twelve corporations.  The Census Bureau does not provide data for
    this thirteenth ANRC because it hasn         no defined geographic extent and thus
    it does not appear in the TIGER/Line Files.  The Census Bureau offers representatives
    of the twelve non-profit ANRCs inn         Alaska the opportunity to review and
    update the ANRC boundaries before each decennial census.  The ANRC boundaries are
    those reported as of January 1, 2010.",nt"license_title": "Creative Commons
