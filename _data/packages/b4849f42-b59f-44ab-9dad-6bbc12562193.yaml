    with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service,
    and meets the standards and specifications on the National Park Service Soil Inventory
    and Monitoring Program, and is intended to serve as the official database for all
    agency applications regarding our soils resources. This data set is a digital soil
    survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed
    by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
    maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or
    by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data
    set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data.
    The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field
    verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable
    pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped.
    A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer
    displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but
    they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
    management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information
    System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component
    soils and their properties.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
