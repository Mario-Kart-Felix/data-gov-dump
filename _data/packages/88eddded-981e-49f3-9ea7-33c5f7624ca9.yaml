    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    computational methods and wind tunnel test model in support of new  freeplay criteria
    for the design, construction and controlled actuation of control surfaces with varying
    amounts of freeplay and their aeroelastic response. These methods will be validated
    with wind tunnel and flight test data. In Phase I a nonlinear computational aeroservoelastic
    methodology will be developed for freeplay induced flutter/LCO and gust response.
    Validation will be achieved by comparisons with legacy and new wind tunnel test
    data. In Phase II the methodology will be generalized to create a mature software
    capability for closed-loop aeroelastic systems in the trimmed/untrimmed state including
    gust, stick or random aeroacoustic excitations. An all movable tail wing wind tunnel
    test article will be designed and built with variable freeplay with initial test
    evaluation completed in Phase I and a thorough parameter variation data set and
    will be developed in Phase II for computational code validation in Phase II. Subject
    to available funding constraints both high speed transonic as well as subsonic will
    tunnel tests will be undertaken. In Phase III the computational methodology in combination
    wind tunnel test results will be used to support the improvement of the current
    FAA and/or MIL-SPEC freeplay aeroelastic response criteria. Following the successful
    demonstration and validation of the new computational methods, the methodology will
    be proposed for adoption by FAA for commercial applications and the DOD for military
    applications with the expectation that all major civilian and military aerospace
    industries will adopt the design/analysis methodology for freeplay induced LCO/flutter
    prevention.",nt"owner_org": "d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed",nt"extras":
