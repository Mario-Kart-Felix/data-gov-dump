  Version This dataset depicts observation-based stream-level geographic distribution
  of anadromous winter-run steelhead trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus (O. mykiss),
  in California. It was developed for the express purpose of assisting with steelhead
  recovery planning efforts. The distributions reported in this dataset were derived
  from a subset of the data contained in the Aquatic Species Observation Database
  (ASOD), a Microsoft Access multi-species observation data capture application. ASOD
  is an ongoing project designed to capture as complete a set of statewide inland
  aquatic vertebrate species observation information as possible. Please note: A separate
  distribution is available for summer-run steelhead. Contact information is the same
  as for the above. ASOD Observation data were used to develop a network of stream
  segments. These lines are developed by \"tracing down\" from each observation to
  the sea using the flow properties of USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) High
  Resolution hydrography. Lastly these lines, representing stream segments, were assigned
  a value of either Anad Present (Anadromous present). The end result (i.e., this
  layer) consists of a set of lines representing the distribution of steelhead based
  on observations in the Aquatic Species Observation Database. This dataset represents
  stream reaches that are known or believed to be used by steelhead based on steelhead
  observations. Thus, it contains only positive steelhead occurrences. The absence
  of distribution on a stream does not necessarily indicate that steelhead do not
  utilize that stream. Additionally, steelhead may not be found in all streams or
  reaches each year. This is due to natural variations in run size, water conditions,
  and other environmental factors. The information in this data set should be used
  as an indicator of steelhead presence/suspected presence at the time of the observation
  as indicated by the 'Late_Yr' (Latest Year) field attribute. The line features in
  the dataset may not represent the maximum extent of steelhead on a stream; rather
  it is important to note that this distribution most likely underestimates the actual
  distribution of steelhead. This distribution is based on observations found in the
  ASOD database. The individual observations may not have occurred at the upper extent
  of anadromous occupation. In addition, no attempt was made to capture every observation
  of O. mykiss and so it should not be assumed that this dataset is complete for each
  stream. The distribution dataset was built solely from the ASOD observational data.
  No additional data (habitat mapping, barriers data, gradient modeling, etc.) were
  utilized to either add to or validate the data. It is very possible that an anadromous
  observation in this dataset has been recorded above (upstream of) a barrier as identified
  in the Passage Assessment Database (PAD). In the near future, we hope to perform
  a comparative analysis between this dataset and the PAD to identify and resolve
  all such discrepancies. Such an analysis will add rigor to and help validate both
  datasets. This dataset has recently undergone a review. Data source contributors
  as well as CDFG fisheries biologists have been provided the opportunity to review
  and suggest edits or additions during a recent review. Data contributors were notified
  and invited to review and comment on the handling of the information that they provided.
  The distribution was then posted to an intranet mapping application and CDFG biologists
  were provided an opportunity to review and comment on the dataset. During this review,
  biologists were also encouraged to add new observation data. This resulting final
  distribution contains their suggestions and additions. Please refer to \"Use Constraints\"
