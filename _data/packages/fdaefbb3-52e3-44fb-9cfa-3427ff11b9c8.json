	"notes": "Emergence of Indium Phosphide IC's has made possible devices operatingnat frequencies up to 200GHZ and beyond. Building modules using thesendevices opens a goldmine of military and commercial applications.nSystems integration of these devices into affordable and reliablenmodules has been a challenge due to costs associated with assemblynrequirements. Research into: placement precision requirements, materialnselection and cost, assembly processes, and automation are the subjectsnof this proposal. Because of its capabilities, NxGen Electronics isnuniquely qualified to perform this research. Since 2003 JPL has beenndeveloping Miniature MMIC low power Radiometers for GeoSTAR and PATHnMissions. Current weather and surface observational satellites employnboth infrared (IR) and microwave (MW) atmospheric sounders. Since cloudsnare almost completely opaque at infrared wavelengths, sounds requirencloud free observation. POES satellites provide coverage but providencoverage in relatively narrow swaths, and with revisit time of 12-24nhours. GeoSTAR offers the possibility of MW temperature and water vapornsoundings as well as rain mapping from GEO. The results of this SBIRnresearch will be a direct benefit to these programs by using theirnrequirements as a focus for the study, and provide the groundwork fornbroader support for the commercialization process.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
