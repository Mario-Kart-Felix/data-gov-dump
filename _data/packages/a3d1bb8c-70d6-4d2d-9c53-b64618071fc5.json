	"notes": "Locating, summarizing and presenting large collections of Earth science data in a highly distributed and networked environment is critical in NASA's mission for Earth Sciences. Technologies supporting management, storage, search and retrieval of very large, distributed, geo-spatial earth science data volumes are urgently needed to cope with the impending data survivability crisis. For instance, the EOSDIS archive data growth rate is currently about 1 petabyte/year. NRC's Committee on Coping with Increasing Demands on Government Data Centers recently made a series of recommendations on which emerging technologies can help data centers meet user needs and build and maintain the long-term record of environmental change. In this proposal, we propose to design, develop and prototype Extrieva - a low cost scalable Archive Storage Management System innovation, which embraces several of the NRC technology recommendations. In particular, Extrieva is a disk-based solution as assessed by NRC to be now competitive with tape for long-term, archival-class storage. Moreover, with its self-management and automation features implemented over commodity Linux clusters using distributed indexing and load balancing algorithms, Extrieva offers a low cost scalable solution with unprecedented ease of management addressing the needs of EOSDIS' diverse global users base.

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
