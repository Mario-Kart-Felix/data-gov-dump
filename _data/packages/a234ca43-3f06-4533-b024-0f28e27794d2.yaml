    this file is to provide the geography for the 2010 Census Blocks along with their
    2010 housing unit count and population. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded
    on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad
    tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county
    limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Blocks are the
    smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial
    census. A block may consist of one or more faces.n",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
