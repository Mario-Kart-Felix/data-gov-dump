    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;rntMaintenance of the musculoskeletal
    system is of crucial importance for mobility of astronauts during long-duration
    missions and upon return to 1-G. However, substantial research shows that skeletal
    muscle undergoes atrophy during spaceflight. Reports on muscle atrophy are typically
    based on study of cross-sectional area, a measurement that ignores more detailed
    changes in muscle structure. Knowledge of the structure of skeletal muscle is key
    to understanding its function. Ultrasound imaging of muscle during contraction could
    provide important insight into the relationship between muscle structure and function.
    Importantly, the use of novel ultrasonographic techniques to evaluate dynamic muscle
    structure may provide critical information regarding the underlying mechanisms of
    microgravity-induced strength loss.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntFive subjects performed
    various passive and active contractions while ultrasound images of the rectus femoris
    were obtained. We demonstrated that acquisition of contracting muscle is obtainable
    using a high frequency ultrasound probe, and that the contracting muscle can be
    tracked with various algorithms using a custom Matlab program. This work was completed
    in September, 2012. Further investigations are needed to determine the most valid
    algorithm for tracking muscle, to assess the reliability of the muscle tracking
    technique, and to ascertain the association between torque and skeletal muscle strain.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rnt&lt;em&gt;Tracking
    Algorithms in Matlab Program:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntUltrasound images
    of tissue consist of a set of intensity forming &amp;lsquo;speckles&amp;rsquo; that
    create patterns. If the ultrasound probe remains in the same position during a movement,
    the changes in the speckle patterns represent movements in the tissue. These movements
    can be directly and actively followed using speckle-tracking algorithms. Movements
    of the tissue over the course of an image sequence can then be quantified by monitoring
    changes in the position of the speckles. Five muscle tracking algorithms were tested
    with each algorithm outputting muscle strain throughout contractions.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rnt&lt;em&gt;Analysis
    of Ultrasound Images with Matlab Program:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntOn a
    typical ultrasound image (&lt;strong&gt;Figure&lt;/strong&gt;), the&amp;nbsp;cross
    sectional area&amp;nbsp;of the muscle (rectus femoris) appears in the center of
    the image. Visual inspection confirmed that relative motion between the edges can
    be used to estimate the changes in length and thickness of the muscle. The muscle
    tracking algorithms automatically tracked the change in position of each marker
    from the initial frame to subsequent frames for the duration of the contraction.&lt;/p&gt;rn",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
