	"notes": "Virtual Globe (VG) systems such as Google Earth, NASA World Winds and Microsoft Virtual Earth provide captivating animated 3D visualizations and support user queries for information at a point. NASA MSFC's VG-based Real Time Mission Monitor (RTMM) enhances management and tracking of field experiment missions. The National Weather Service's RIDGE service uses VG to disseminate radar and support decision assistance. Simpson Weather Associate's Doppler Wind Lidar uses VG technology provided by WxAnalyst to manage field experiment instrumentation and data acquisition in flight.\r\n\r\nWxAnalyst has recently prototyped the WxAzygy&lt;SUP&gt;TM&lt;\/SUP&gt; Interface to couple external applications with Google Earth (GE). Such user applications are inherently unlimited, and can embrace Geographic Information System (GIS) by inclusion of licensed GIS or the OGC GeoTools open source. Full GIS coupling through a transparent and overlaid interface would provide a standard means for complex user operations in the VG environment. The independence of this interface decouples external functions from the VG, can provide security\/privacy where needed, and could potentially encourage VG evolution. Our vision for GIS-VG coupling involves the concept of a \"focus object\" which is mutually shared by the VG and Interface. This focus object is described in GE by KML 2.2. GE interaction is currently supported through an Application Programmer Interface (API) downloaded with each installation.  The GE API could become the basis for a standard and be potentially extended. Possible capabilities in situ with VG include spatial data selection and cross referencing, comparison and cross-correlation of simultaneous and collocated data objects with disparate geometries, and interaction with data servers to acquire, load and subset data \"on the fly\".  This type of new technology will enable greater utilization of extremely large, complicated, and highly distributed datasets on all spatial scales over large geographic areas.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
