    backscatter mosaic of the bathymetry of a reef shelf/bank south of Vieques, Puerto
    Rico. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel
    Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam
    bathymetry data in and around the Northeast Reserve from 3/05/2013 to 3/29/2013.
    Data was acquired with a moon pool mounted Reson 7125 multibeam echosounder (400
    kHz). Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The backscatter component of the
    bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using .HSX and
    .7k file pairs that were converted to GSF in Hypack 2012, then processed in Fledermaus
    Geocoder Toolbox 7.3.3c. Acoustic backscatter mosaics are an important piece of
    information when characterizing surficial seafloor features and delineating benthic
    habitats. The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards,
    dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate
    the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.",nt"license_title":
