The MTDB representsn               a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent datan               set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. In New England (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont),n               the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has defined an alternative county subdivision (generally cities and towns) based definition of Core Basedn               Statistical Areas (CBSAs) known as New England City and Town Areas (NECTAs). NECTAs are defined using the same criteria as Metropolitan Statistical Areasn               and Micropolitan Statistical Areas and are identified as either metropolitan or micropolitan, based, respectively, on the presence of either an urbann               area of 50,000 or more population or an urban cluster of at least 10,000 and less than 50,000 population. A NECTA containing a single core urban arean               with a population of at least 2.5 million may be subdivided to form smaller groupings of cities and towns referred to as NECTA Divisions. The NECTAs forn               the 2010 Census are those defined by OMB and published in December 2009.",
