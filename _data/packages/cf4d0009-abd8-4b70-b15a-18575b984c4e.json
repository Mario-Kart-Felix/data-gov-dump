	"notes": "NanoSonic has recently developed multifunctional shielding and self-healing HybridSil&amp;#63720; (HS) smart composites via the inclusion of innovative nanoshell inclusions.  These lightweight yet high-strength rapidly self-healing materials combined with NanoSonic's Metal Rubber&amp;#153; (MR) shielding nano-additives and are offered herein as protection systems for NASA vehicles, habitat modules, and pressure vessel structures.  The conductive aspect of Metal Rubber also enables damage detection.  This technology may overcome the current bottleneck of damage tolerance for current composites that form nearly undetectable cracks upon impact that impart drastic effects on the structural survivability.  HS-MR self-healing composites offer both self-healing and damage detection, as well as the added functionality of very high levels of electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) without the need for additional heavy layers.  MR exhibits EMI SE of greater than -100 dB upon exposure to a blow torch, repeated cold flexing at -50 ?C, and irradiation under a 60Co source.  During Phase I, TRL 5 shall be reached upon demonstration of damage tolerant, self-healing structural composites with assistance from our radiation expert STTR partner, CSU, and commercial space partner.  During Phase II, TRL 7 shall be achieved upon demonstrated damage detection and self-healing in a representative flight environment with our defense prime partner.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
