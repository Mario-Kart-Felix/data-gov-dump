	"notes": "During the Phase II Lunar Health Monitor program, Orbital Research will develop a second generation wearable sensor suite for astronaut physiologic monitoring. The low profile system will be appropriate for both Extravehicular activities (EVA) and Intravehicular activities (IVA) monitoring scenarios. The EVA and IVA wearable platforms are capable of monitoring a complete physiologic profile of overall astronaut health status. Sensors of respiration, body temperature, acceleration and cardiac data are included. Inclusive in this sensor suite is Orbital's FDA cleared and patented dry recording electrodes. The sensors are held to the body via the garment and function without any tapes, adhesives or gels. The sensors are mechanically connected to the sensor suite. The mechanical connections allow sensors to be semi-permanently interfaced with either the EVA or IVA designs. These connectors allow sensors to be added, removed or replaced based on monitor application or anatomical constraints. The Lunar Health Monitor is designed to be continuously worn serving as a safety mechanism for out of vehicle exploration missions and a monitoring device for applications such as in orbit fitness assessment. The Lunar Health Monitor is easy to don and doff and non-encumbering to routine and functional tasks.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
