		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

	"notes": "Broad classes of statistical classification algorithms have beendeveloped and applied successfully to a wide range of real worlddomains. In general, ensuring that the particular classificationalgorithm matches the properties of the data is crucial inproviding results that meet the needs of the particular applicationdomain. One way in which the impact of this algorithm/applicationmatch can be alleviated is by using ensembles of classifiers, wherea variety of classifiers (either different types of classifiers ordifferent instantiations of the same classifier) are pooled before afinal classification decision is made. Intuitively, classifierensembles allow the different needs of a difficult problem to behandled by classifiers suited to those particular needs.Mathematically, classifier ensembles provide an extra degree offreedom in the classical bias/variance tradeoff, allowing solutionsthat would be difficult (if not impossible) to reach with only asingle classifier. Because of these advantages, classifier ensembles have been applied to many difficult real world problems. In this paper, we surveyselect applications of ensemble methods to problems that havehistorically been most representative of the difficulties inclassification. In particular, we survey applications of ensemblemethods to remote sensing, person recognition, one vs. allrecognition, and medicine.",
