	"notes": "The scope of this project is to provide a digital auto-correlation spectrometer fabricated on a single integrated circuit for NASA's future Earth-Sun System missions in order to enable the rapid development of small, ultra low-power, low-cost microwave remote sensing instruments for the analysis of chemical and  physical properties of planetary atmospheres. The  technical risk associated with the proposed Phase II project is low because all Phase I technical objectives were achieved using an innovative approach that consists of a synergistic combination of parallel architecture and differential circuits; based on the results obtained in Phase I,  it is anticipated that the power consumption of  a 4096-lag, 1 GHz bandwidth, 2-bit/4-level  digital auto-correlation spectrometer chip fabricated with IBM's 90 nm will be less than 4 W. The overall benefits of the proposed project, if successful, consist of the availability of a new class of high-bandwidth and ultra-low power digital auto-correlation spectrometer chip that will facilitate the construction of NASA's spaceborne microwave remote sensing instruments with substantially lower life-cycle costs,  power consumption,  and mass relative to that of existing filter-bank and acousto-optical spectrometers.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
