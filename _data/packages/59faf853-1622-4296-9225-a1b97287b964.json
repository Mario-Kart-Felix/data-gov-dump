	"notes": "Mobitrum is proposing to develop a broadband wireless device for real-time data acquisition and monitoring applicable to the field instrumentation and control systems associated with ground testing facilities. This effort is targeted for data management and intelligent sensor fusion across local and mobile computational platforms for real-time graphical representation and methods for collaborative distribution, efficient storage, and archival. This effort will include (1) Design of the wireless device to maximize the capability of the rocket engine ground testing and safety assurance that include: power consumption, reliability, performance, data rate, throughput, signal coverage, security, configurability, portability, and cost; (2) Design of the wireless device architecture including network topologies, user's query language, data representations and formats, communication modules, low-level device driver,  fault tolerance, portability, and performance; and (3) Specify smart agents for rules, procedures, software algorithms, and techniques for designing a high-speed wireless portal system.  Smart agents will increase the capability of the data acquisition and health monitoring from remote access and increases the safety. This proposed enabling technology will provide NASA a cost-effective and high-speed tool for collaborative data management and distribution, sensing and monitoring, and other situational awareness such as testing infrastructure and facilities.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
