  climate, and crop observations to document the spatial distribution of the recent
  stagnation in food grain production affecting the water-limited tropics (WLT), a
  region where 1.5 billion people live and depend on local agriculture that is constrained
  by chronic water shortages. Overall, our analysis shows that the recent stagnation
  in food production is corroborated by satellite data. The growth rate in annually
  integrated vegetation greenness, a measure of crop growth, has declined significantly
  (p < 0.10) in 23% of the WLT cropland area during the last decade, while statistically
  significant increases in the growth rates account for less than 2%. In most countries,
  the decade-long declines appear to be primarily due to unsustainable crop management
  practices rather than climate alone. One quarter of the statistically significant
  declines are observed in India, which with the worldu2019s largest population of
  food-insecure people and largest WLT croplands, is a leading example of the observed
  declines. Here we show geographically matching patterns of enhanced crop production
  and irrigation expansion with groundwater that have leveled off in the past decade.
  We estimate that, in the absence of irrigation, the enhancement in dry-season food
  grain production in India, during 1982u20132002, would have required an increase
  in annual rainfall of at least 30% over almost half of the cropland area. This suggests
  that the past expansion of use of irrigation has not been sustainable. We expect
  that improved surface and groundwater management practices will be required to reverse
  the recent food grain production declines.rnrn rn**MDPI and ACS Style**rnrnMilesi,

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
