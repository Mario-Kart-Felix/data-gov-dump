The hydrography layer within the buffer coverage should not be used as a separate hydrography layer. The Kansas hydrography layer used to develop the riparian buffer should be used as the accompanied coverage. Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data.
