    earthquake at 03:36 UT on March 28, 1964, was one of the largest shocks ever recorded
    on the North American Continent. The quake was felt over 500,000 square miles. The
    quake took 131 lives and caused $350-500 million in property damage (One hundred
    twenty-two of the deaths were attributed to the tsunami.) The area of the damage
    zone (50,000 square miles) and the duration of the quake (3 to 4 minutes) were extraordinary.
    This set of slides shows geologic changes, damage to structures, transportation
    systems, and utilities and tsunami damage. It features the effects of four major
    landslides in Anchorage during the 1964 event. Certainly the quake would have claimed
    many more lives had the population not been sparse, the weather clement, and had
    the quake not occurred during the off-season for fishing and on the evening of a
    holiday when the schools were empty and most offices deserted.Geologic Changes -
    The quake was accompanied by vertical displacement of earth over a 100,000 square
    mile region. The maximum uplift recorded was 33 feet (10 m) on land, and as much
    as 50 feet (15 m) on the sea floor. Subsidence exceeded 7 feet (2 m). The uplift
    destroyed or greatly impaired the usefulness of many harbors. The habitats of many
    animals, trees and other vegetation were destroyed or damaged by subsidence. Low-lying
    settlements and many miles of railroad and highway were dropped below the level
    of high tide so that they were periodically flooded and attacked by storm waves.
    Crustal deformation associated with this earthquake was the most extensive ever
    recorded and extended far beyond the epicentral area. Faulting of bedrock at the
    earth's surface during the earthquake was found only in the area of maximum tectonic
    uplift on southwest Montague Island in Prince William Sound and on the sea floor
    southwest of Montague Island. No faulting at the surface was found in the zone between
    the areas that were tectonically uplifted and downdropped. Grabens (elongated down-dropped
    blocks between faults) formed in many places. The strong ground motion induced many
    snowslides, rockfalls, and subaerial and subaqueous landslides. Large subaerial
    slides in Anchorage and subaqueous slides at Valdez and Seward damaged streets,
    buildings, utilities, and shore side structures. Numerous slope and embankment failures
    harmed railways, highways, and particularly bridges. Rock avalanches and snow avalanches,
    subsidence, and consolidation occurred; and cracks, fissures, and sand spouts developed
    in many places. Soil liquefaction played a major roll in the development of most
    landslides.Damage To Structures, Transportation, and Utilities - Anchorage, Cordova,
    Homer, Kodiak, Seldovia, Seward, and Valdez were damaged severely by uplift or subsidence,
    shaking, landslides, tsunamis, and fires. In Anchorage damaging landslides occurred
    in Turnagain, Fourth Avenue, "L" Street, and Government Hill areas. Structural
    damage was largely the result of landslides. Seismic vibration caused severe structural
    damage in Anchorage, Valdez, and the large delta of the Coper River. Damage from
    seismic vibration was most common in buildings and structures constructed of heavy
    materials and tended to be most severe in tall buildings. Notable among the partly
    or completely collapsed buildings in Anchorage were the Four Seasons apartment building,
    the Government Hill School, and the J.C. Penney building. However, many of the heavy
    structures in these areas sustained minimal seismic damage. Generally well-built
    wood-frame buildings of seismic resistant design sustained very little damage from
    vibration generated by the earthquake. Valdez was severely damaged by a large submarine
    landslide and the resulting waves that destroyed the waterfront facilities. The
    ground beneath the town was deformed damaging the foundations of structures. The
    town was moved to a new site at a cost of $37,500,000.Damage to surface transportation
    facilities was extensive. Landslides, embankment failures, subsidence of ground,
    tsunami action, and soil movements that distorted or destroyed bridges were the
    main causes of damage. The Alaska Railroad lost its port facility at Whittier, its
    docks at Seward, and numerous bridges on the Kenai Peninsula. Reconstruction of
    the railroad facilities was completed in two and one half years at a cost of $22
    million. Many highway bridges, especially on the Seward and Copper River highways,
    were damaged. Many port and harbor facilities, especially at Seward, Valdez, Kodiak,
    Whittier, Cordova, and Homer, were destroyed. The major damage to utilities occurred
    in Anchorage where the earth slides set in motion by the earthquake caused extensive
    damage to all utility systems. Oil storage tanks at Valdez, Seward, and Whittier
    ruptured and burned.Tsunamis - The submarine landslides resulting from the earthquake
    created local sea waves or tsunamis, which, together with the major tsunami generated
    by the crustal deformation, smashed port and harbor facilities, disturbed and killed
    salmon fry, leveled forests, and caused the saltwater invasion of many coastal freshwater
    lakes. In addition to the local tsunamis the earthquake generated a major tsunami
    that was recorded throughout the Pacific Basin and lapped against Antarctica. The
    major tsunami caused extensive damage outside Alaska in Port Alberni British Columbia
    and took 16 lives in Oregon and California. Of the one hundred twenty-two deaths
    resulting from the tsunamis, at least 71 deaths were blamed on the local slump-generated
    tsunamis in Alaska. The quake also generated seiches in rivers, harbors, channels,
    lakes, and swimming pools as distant as the United States Gulf Coast States. Total
    tsunami damage amounted to about $84 million in Alaska.",nt"license_title":
