    during the 2010 U.S. Census. The data are organized into layers representing Tract,
    Block, and Block Group visualizations. Geography The TIGER Line Files are feature
    classes and related database files that are an extract of selected geographic and
    cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically
    Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The
    MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts,
    however, each TIGER Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data
    set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small,
    relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity,
    and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical
    Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where
    no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to
    participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of
    geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous
    decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200
    and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census
    tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics,
    economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies
    widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns
    caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary
    revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth,
    or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries
    generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries
    such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States
    and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where
    the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and
    county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic
    hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous
    areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive
    with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010
    Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census
    tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000
    data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian
    reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899
    was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and
    represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military
    installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998
    was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.
