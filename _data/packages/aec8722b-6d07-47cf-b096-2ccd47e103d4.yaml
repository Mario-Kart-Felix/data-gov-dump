    States (PAD-US) is a geodatabase, managed by USGS GAP, that illustrates and describes
    public land ownership, management and other conservation lands, including voluntarily
    provided privately protected areas. The State, Regional and LCC geodatabases contain
    two feature classes. The PADUS1_3_FeeEasement feature class and the national MPA
    feature class. Legitimate and other protected area overlaps exist in the full inventory,
    with Easements loaded on top of Fee. Parcel data within a protected area are dissolved
    in this file that powers the PAD-US Viewer. As overlaps exist, GAP creates separate
    analytical layers to summarize area statistics for "GAP Status Code" and "Owner
    Name". Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for more information. The lands included
    in PAD-US are assigned conservation measures that qualify their intent to manage
    lands for the preservation of biological diversity and to other natural, recreational
    and cultural uses; managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means.
    The geodatabase includes: 1) Geographic boundaries of public land ownership and
    voluntarily provided private conservation lands (e.g., Nature Conservancy Preserves);
    2) The combination land owner, land manager, management designation or type, parcel
    name, GIS Acres and source of geographic information of each mapped land unit 3)
    GAP Status Code conservation measure of each parcel based on USGS National Gap Analysis
    Program (GAP) protection level categories which provide a measurement of management
    intent for long-term biodiversity conservation 4) IUCN category for a protected
    area's inclusion into UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre's World Database
    for Protected Areas. IUCN protected areas are defined as, "A clearly defined geographical
    space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means,
    to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services
    and cultural values" and are categorized following a classification scheme available
    through USGS GAP; 5) World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA) Site Codes linking
    the multiple parcels of a single protected area in PAD-US and connecting them to
    the Global Community. As legitimate and other overlaps exist in the combined inventory
    GAP creates separate analytical layers to obtain area statistics for "GAP Status
    Code" and "Owner Name". PAD-US version 1.3 Combined updates include: 1) State,
    local government and private protected area updates delivered September 2011 from
    PAD-US State Data Stewards: CO (Colorado State University), FL (Florida Natural
    Areas Inventory), ID (Idaho Fish and Game), MA (The Commonwealth's Office of Geographic
    Information Systems, MassGIS), MO (University of Missouri, MoRAP), MT (Montana Natural
    Heritage Program), NM (Natural Heritage New Mexico), OR (Oregon Natural Heritage
    Program), VA (Department of Conservation and Recreation, Virginia Natural Heritage
    Program). 2) Select local government (i.e. county, city) protected areas (3,632)
    across the country (to complement the current PAD-US inventory) aggregated by the
    Trust for Public Land (TPL) for their Conservation Almanac that tracks the conservation
    finance movement across the country. 3) A new Date of Establishment field that identifies
    the year an area was designated or otherwise protected, attributed for 86% of GAP
    Status Code 1 and 2 protected areas. Additional dates will be provided in future
    updates. 4) A national wilderness area update from wilderness.net 5) The Access
    field that describes public access to protected areas as defined by data stewards
    or categorical assignment by Primary Designation Type. . The new Access Source field
    documents local vs. categorical assignments. See the PAD-US Standard Manual for
    more information: gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus 6) The transfer of conservation measures
    (i.e. GAP Status Codes, IUCN Categories) and documentation (i.e. GAP Code Source,
    GAP Code Date) from PAD-US version 1.2 or categorical assignments (see PAD-US Standard)
    when not provided by data stewards 7) Integration of non-sensitive National Conservation
    Easement Database (NCED) easements from August 2011, July 2012 with PAD-US version
    1.2 easements. Duplicates were removed, unless 'Stacked' = Y and multiple easements
    exist. 8) Unique ID's transferred from NCED or requested for new easements. NCED
    and PAD-US are linked via Source UID in the PAD-US version 1.3 Easement feature
    class. 9) Official (member and eligible) MPAs from the NOAA MPA Inventory (March
    2011, www.mpa.gov) translated into the PAD-US schema with conservation measures
    transferred from PAD-US version 1.2 or categorically assigned to new protected areas.
    Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for documentation of categorical GAP Status Code
    assignments for MPAs. 10) Identified MPA records that overlap existing protected
    areas in the PAD-US Fee feature class (i.e. PADUS Overlap field in MPA feature class).
    For example, many National Wildlife Refuges and National Parks are also MPAs and
    are represented in the PAD-US MPA and Fee feature classes.",nt"license_title":

    these data are directly acquired from the U.S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Program
    server, and not indirectly through other sources which may have changed the data
    in some way. It is also strongly recommended that careful attention be paid to the
    contents of the metadata file associated with these data. The U.S. Geological Survey
    shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data described and/or
    contained herein. All information is created with a specific end use or uses in
    mind. This is especially true for GIS data, which is expensive to produce and must
    be directed to meet the immediate program needs. However, these data were created
    with the expectation that they would be used for other applications; therefore,
    we list below both appropriate and inappropriate uses. This list is in no way exhaustive
    but should serve as a guide to assess whether a proposed use can or cannot be supported
    by these data. For many uses, it is unlikely that PAD-US will provide the only data
    needed, and for uses with a regulatory outcome, field surveys should verify the
    result. In the end, it will be the responsibility of each data user to determine
    if these data can answer the question being asked, and if they are the best tool
    to answer that question. While it is impossible to predict all the uses of these
    data we have listed several possible appropriate and inappropriate uses from GAP's
    perspective. The Nature Conservancy data were aggregated with consideration for
    the following Access constraints: The Nature Conservancy reserves all rights to
    the TNC data provided. All data are provided as is. The information provided is
    is not a survey quality dataset. The Nature Conservancy makes no warranty as to
    the currency, completeness, accuracy or utility of any specific data. This disclaimer
    applies both to individual use of the data and aggregate use with other data. It
    is strongly recommended that careful attention be paid to the contents of the metadata
    file associated with these data. Use constraints: The Nature Conservancy shall not
    be held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data described and/or contained
    herein. Any sale, distribution, loan, or offering for use of these digital data,
    in whole or in part, is prohibited without the approval of the Nature Conservancy.
    The use of these data to produce other GIS products and services with the intent

    All parties receiving these data must be informed of these restrictions. The Nature
    Conservancy shall be acknowledged as data contributors to any reports or other products
    derived from these data. Appropriate uses of the data: primarily as a coarse map
    for a large area such as a county or to provide context for finer-level maps. A
    general list of possible applications include: -National, regional or statewide
    biodiversity planning -National, Regional or state habitat conservation planning
    -County comprehensive planning -Large-area resource management planning -Coarse-filter
    evaluation of potential impacts or benefits of major projects or plan initiatives
    on biodiversity, such as utility or transportation corridors, wilderness proposals,
    habitat connectivity proposals, climate change adaption proposals, regional open
    space and recreation proposals, etc. -Determining relative amounts of management
    responsibility for specific biological resources among land stewards to facilitate
    cooperative management and planning. -Basic research on regional distributions of
    plants and animals and to help target both specific species and geographic areas
    for needed research. -Environmental impact assessment for large projects or military
    activities. -Estimation of potential economic impacts from loss of biological resource-based
    activities. -Education at all levels and for both students and citizens. Inappropriate
    Uses: It is far easier to identify appropriate uses than inappropriate ones, however,
    there is a "fuzzy line" that is eventually crossed when the differences in resolution
    of the data, size of geographic area being analyzed, and precision of the answer
    required for the question are no longer compatible. Examples include: -Using the
    data to map small areas (less than thousands of hectares), typically requiring mapping
    resolution at 1:24,000 scale and using aerial photographs or ground surveys. -Combining
    these data with other data finer than 1:100,000 scale to produce new hybrid maps
    or answer queries. -Generating specific areal measurements from the data finer than
    the nearest thousand hectares -Establishing exact boundaries for regulation or acquisition.
    -Establishing definite occurrence or non-occurrence of any feature for an exact
    geographic area -Determining abundance, health, or condition of any feature. -Establishing
    a measure of accuracy of any other data by comparison with GAP data. -Altering the
    data in any way and redistributing them as a GAP data product. -Using the data without
    acquiring and reviewing the metadata and this report."]"nt},nt{ntt"key":
