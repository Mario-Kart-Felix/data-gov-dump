    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Historically, radar systems have tended
    to be either large, complex, power-hungry, purpose-built systems, or extremely simple
    systems of limited capability. More recently, miniaturization of high-performance
    programmable integrated circuit technologies as embodied in field-programmable gate
    arrays (FPGAs), as well as rapid advances in high-speed data conversion technologies
    at a gigasample per second and beyond, have enabled the implementation of direct-conversion
    radio frequency (RF) systems, including radar, that operate almost completely in
    the digital domain. In addition, solid-state high-power RF device technologies have
    improved in efficiency and speed to the point where highly efficient pulsed transmit
    sources are possible. As these device technologies have matured, their application
    in space environments has accelerated to the point where extremely flexible programmable
    radar systems can be implemented in a very small size, weight, and power footprint.
    Trident Systems has developed a powerful radar architecture called RAPTOR, validating
    it through flight testing on a number of Department of Defense programs. In Phase
    I of this effort, Trident Systems developed and validated a design concept for a
    flexible, programmable space-qualifiable digital radar transceiver (SQDRT) based
    on RAPTOR.  This was accomplished through a comprehensive development process consisting
    of mission and requirements analysis, component trade studies, design analysis and
    simulation, and interface &amp; form factor trade studies.  The objective of the
    Phase II effort is to successfully produce a functioning form-factor prototype of
    the SQDRT, through a comprehensive program of system modeling and simulation, detailed
    digital &amp; RF electronic design, FPGA firmware development, mechanical design,
    fabrication, integration, and testing, culminating in a prototype demonstration.
     By basing the solution on proven RAPTOR technology, the system will rapidly achieve
    a high TRL.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
