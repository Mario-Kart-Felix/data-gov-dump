  ion exchange water treatment of groundwater to meet the growing potable water demand
  in eastern North Carolina has prompted interest in the potential environmental impacts
  of these unique water treatment processes. These processes generate a reject water
  comprised of concentrated salts, metals, and other constituents and major ion toxicity
  is an important concern in other states where these drinking water production technologies
  are more prevalent. Effluent and receiving stream samples were collected at three
  ion exchange and two reverse osmosis membrane water treatment plants (WTP) in North
  Carolina. Routine water quality characteristics, ion, nutrient and metal concentrations
  were documented in 15 effluent and 30 receiving stream samples between 2004 and
  2005. Facility and process-specific differences in water quality characteristics
  of effluents collected from the ion exchange WTPs were apparent. Effluent ion concentrations
  were typically highest during the sodium regeneration cycle followed by the final
  rinse and backwash cycles of the ion exchange treatment process. Total residual
  chlorine concentrations in effluent from one ion exchange facility exceeded the
  state standard (of 17 u00b5g/L) by 8- to 36-fold. Effluent characteristics differed
  substantially between the two reverse osmosis WTPs (likely due to source water chemistry);
  however, effluent samples from each facility were relatively uniform in chemical
  composition between sampling events. To determine the significance of ion imbalance
  toxicity associated with process effluents, 15 chronic baseline whole effluent toxicity
  (WET) tests were conducted using Ceriodaphnia dubia (water flea) and Americamysis
  bahia (opossum shrimp) in freshwater and saltwater exposures, respectively. Only
  one effluent sample was not acutely or chronically toxic to test organisms during
  the baseline WET tests. The toxicity of ion exchange effluents varied based on the
  treatment cycle with sodium regeneration samples being most toxic at all three facilities
  (and rinse and backwash cycles generally associated with lower toxicity). Subsequent
  toxicity tests using whole effluent and synthetic effluent test mixtures were performed
  to identify the potential for major ion imbalance as a source of toxicity in the
  baseline tests. Of the 14 effluent samples where subsequent tests were conducted,
  results indicated that sublethal toxicity in only one sample appeared to be related
  to a constituent other than the major ions; the results of testing with another
  sample were inconclusive due to elevated control mortality. Bioassessment of benthic
  community structure was also conducted to determine potential aquatic community
  structure impacts in the vicinity of the WTPs. Quantitative assessment could only
  be performed in the receiving stream (Filbert Creek) for two ion exchange facilities.
  Although an ion gradient (potentially related to hypersaline effluent releases or
  wind/tidal influence) was present in Filbert Creek, increasing taxa richness and
  decreasing biotic index values were found along this gradient suggesting that ion
  concentrations present have not uniquely stressed benthic communities. At the remaining
  three WTP sites, qualitative assessment indicates the presence of limited benthic
  communities (dominated by species tolerant of low-flow and low-oxygen conditions).
  Study results provide sufficient evidence that ion concentrations in reverse osmosis
  and ion exchange water treatment plant effluents are a primary source of the effluent
  toxicity. Proposed management recommendations focus on more closely matching effluent
  and receiving stream ion characteristics at existing and proposed WTPs by either
  diluting effluents prior to discharge (in freshwater environments) and maximizing
  instream dilution through outfall design and placement.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
