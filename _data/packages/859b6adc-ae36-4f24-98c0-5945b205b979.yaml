  geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore of Salt Point map area, California.
  The vector data file is included in \"Geology_OffshoreSaltPoint.zip,\" which is
  accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreSaltPoint/data_catalog_OffshoreSaltPoint.html.
  The morphology and the geology of the Offshore of Salt Point map area result from
  the interplay between local sea-level rise, sedimentary processes, oceanography,
  and tectonics. The offshore part of the map area extends from the shoreline to water
  depths of about 90 to 100 m on the mid-continental shelf; the shelfbreak occurs
  about 20 km farther offshore at water depths of about 200 m. The nearshore and inner
  shelf (to water depths of about 50 to 60 m) typically dips seaward about 1.0 to
  1.5 degrees; the mid to outer shelf dips more gently, generally less than 0.5 degrees.
  Sea level has risen about 125 to 130 m over about the last 21,000 years (for example,
  Lambeck and Chappell, 2001; Peltier and Fairbanks, 2005), leading to broadening
  of the continental shelf, progressive eastward migration of the shoreline and wave-cut
  platform, and associated transgressive erosion and deposition. Land-derived sediment
  was carried into this dynamic setting, then subjected to full Pacific Ocean wave
  energy and strong currents before deposition or offshore transport. Tectonic influences
  impacting shelf morphology and geology are related to local faulting, folding, uplift,
  and subsidence (see below). Bedrock of the Eocene and Paleocene German Rancho Formation
  (unit Tgr) underlies much of the inner shelf, extending to water depths of as much
  as 60 m. Although onshore coastal outcrops of this unit are well bedded, seafloor
  outcrops imaged on high-resolution bathymetry have a hackly surface texture and
  abundant fractures. Embayments in the outer margin of the seafloor bedrock outcrops
  are commonly paired with the mouths of coastal watersheds and are inferred to have
  formed by fluvial erosion during the last sealevel lowstand. One of the more prominent
  embayments occurs about one kilometer north of Salt Point at the mouth of Miller
  Creek (fig. 1-2). These coastal watersheds are relatively small and steep, extending
  to a drainage divide just 2 to 3 km east of the shoreline, and are inferred sources
  of coarse-grained sediments. Immediately east of this onshore topographic divide,
  drainage along this part of the coast is captured by the northwest-flowing South
  Fork of the Gualala River (fig. 1-2), which runs parallel to the coast along the
  trace of the San Andreas fault. Given relatively shallow water depths (0 to about
  50 m) and exposure to high wave energy, modern nearshore to mid-shelf sediments
  are mostly sand (unit Qms) and a mix of sand, gravel, and cobbles (units Qmsc and
  Qmsd). The more coarse-grained sands and gravels (units Qmsc and Qmsd) are primarily
  recognized on the basis of bathymetry and high backscatter. Both Qmsc and Qmsd typically
  have abrupt landward contacts with bedrock (unit Tgr) and form irregular to lenticular
  exposures that are commonly elongate in the shore-normal direction. Contacts between
  units Qmsc and Qms are typically gradational. Unit Qmsd forms erosional lags in
  scoured depressions that are bounded by relatively sharp and less commonly diffuse
  contacts with unit Qms horizontal sand sheets. These depressions are typically a
  few tens of centimeters deep and range in size from a few 10's of sq m to more than
  one sq km. Similar unit Qmsd scour depressions are common along this stretch of
  the California coast (see, for example, Cacchione and others, 1984; Hallenbeck and
  others, 2012) where surficial offshore sandy sediment is relatively thin (thus unable
  to fill the depressions) due to both lack of sediment supply and to erosion and
  transport of sediment during large northwest winter swells. Such features have been
  referred to as \"rippled-scour depressions\" (see, for example, Cacchione and others,
  1984) or \"sorted bedforms\" (see, for example, Goff and others, 2005; Trembanis
  and Hume, 2011). Although the general areas in which both unit Qmsd scour depressions
  and surrounding mobile sand sheets occur are not likely to change substantially,
  the boundaries of the individual Qmsd depressions are likely ephemeral, changing
  seasonally and during significant storm events. The offshore decrease in slope at
  mid-shelf water depths (about 60 m) approximately coincides with a transition to
  more fine-grained marine sediments (unit Qmsf), which extends to the outer (3-nautical-mile)
  limit of California's State Waters. Unit Qmsf consists primarily of mud and muddy
  sand and is commonly extensively bioturbated. These fine-grained sediments are inferred
  to have been derived from from the Russian River, which has its mouth about 15 km
  south of the map area. Both Drake and Cacchione (1985) and Sherwood and others (1994)
  have documented seasonal, mid-shelf, northwest-directed, bottom currens capable
  of transporting fine-grained, suspended sediment from the Russian River to the Offshore
  of Salt Point map area. Map unit polygons were digitized over underlying 2-meter
  base layers developed from multibeam bathymetry and backscatter data (see Bathymetry--Offshore
  Salt Point, California and Backscattter--Offshore Salt Point, California, DS 781,
  for more information). The bathymetry and backscatter data were collected between
  2006 and 2010. References Cited Cacchione, D.A., Drake, D.E., Grant, W.D., and Tate,
