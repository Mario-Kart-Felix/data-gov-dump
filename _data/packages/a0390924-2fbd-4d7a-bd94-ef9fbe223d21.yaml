    Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, from 16 October - 14 November 2008, belt transect surveys of coral
    population and diseases quantitative assessments were conducted, as a part of Rapid
    Ecological Assessments (REA), during the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring
    Program (RAMP) Cruise OES0810 in the Main Hawaiian Islands at biennial intervals
    by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries
    Science Center (PIFSC). During the cruise, there were 13 surveys in total conducted
    at REA sites around Maui Island in the Main Hawaiian Islands. At the specific REA
    sites, coral biologists along with fish biologists, algal biologists and marine
    invertebrate zoologist entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~300 m2) and
    high degree of taxonomic resolution REA survey to assess and monitor species composition,
    abundance, percent cover, size distribution, diversity, and general health of fish,
    corals, macro-invertebrates, and algae in shallow-water (< 35 m) habitats. As a
    part of REA surveys, the coral belt surveys were focused on quantifying the diversity,
    abundance, density, and size-class distribution of the anthozoan and hydrozoan corals
    as well as the condition and health state of the coral reef populations. The surveys
    were conducted along two consecutively-placed, 25m transect lines. The belt width
    was dictated at the beginning of each dive by subjective perceived colony density:
    1-m width was used in high density areas, while 2-m width was used in low density
    areas. Within each 25m transect, five 2.5-meter segments were surveyed (beginning
    at points: 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 meters), whereby in each segment, all coral colonies
    whose center fell within 0.5m of either side of the transect line were identified
    to the lowest taxonomic level possible (genus or species) and two planar size metrics
    were collected: maximum diameter and diameter perpendicular to the maximum diameter.
    In addition, the extent of mortality, both recent and old, was estimated for each
    colony. Observers paid special attention to identifying as best as possible the
    extent of the former live colony. When a coral colony exhibited signs of disease
    or compromised health, additional information was recorded including type of affliction
    (bleaching, skeletal growth anomaly, white syndrome, tissue loss other than white
    syndrome, trematodiasis, necrosis, other, pigmentation responses, algal overgrowth,
    and predation), severity of the affliction (mild, moderate, marked, severe, acute),
    as well as photographic documentation and sometimes tissue samples. Tissue samples
    were catalogued and fixed in buffered zinc-formalin solution for further histopathological
    analyses. Raw survey data included species presence and relative abundance, colony
    counts per taxon, size (width and length), mortality, predation, and health status.
    A surveyed area was ranging from 10m2 to 25m2 per site.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
