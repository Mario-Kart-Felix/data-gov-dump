    This Geographic Information System dataset may be described as the 2004 LIDAR-based
    Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for Benton and Washington Counties in Arkansas. Vertical
    units are in Meters. This dataset is a derivative of the Decimal - Feet elevation
    dataset documented below. This raster (25ft resolution) Digital Elevation Model
    (DEM) was generated using a bare earth point cloud obtained from Landair Mapping,
    Inc as part of the August 2004 LIDAR acquisition (Washington & Benton Counties,
    AR) coordinated by John McLarty, Elizabeth Bowen, Brian Culpepper, and Dr. Jack
    Cothren of the Northwest Arkansas Imagery Task Force. This collaborative project
    was made possible due the financial support provided by the numerous State, Federal,
    local government, and private sector entities who actively participated in the Northwest
    Arkansas Imagery Task Force meetings hosted by the NWARPC during 2004. Users of
    these data owe a special thanks to John McLarty (NWARPC) and Elizabeth Bowen (Benton
    County GIS Coordinator) for their superior leadership during this effort. Funding
    to support the distribution of this data via Arkansas' GeoStor was made possible
    by Mullins Library at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville",nt"license_title":
