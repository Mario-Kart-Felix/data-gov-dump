	"notes": "The population dynamics, general biology, and movements of the threatened Ozark cavefish (Amblyopsis rosae) were studied in Logan Cave National Wildlife Refuge, Arkansas. General water quality characteristics for surface recharge streams as well as Logan Cave were monitored from Aug 1992 to Dec 1992 to determine the significance of recharge streams to the Logan Cave stream system. A DataSonde 3 Hydrolab Unit recorded water quality for Logan Cave from Aug 1991 to Jan 1993. Rainfall for the recharge area of Logan Cave was also recorded and plotted against Logan Cave water quality parameters. Logan Cave was mapped and classified into regions to monitor cavefish movements. Cavefish were tagged using visual implant tags developed by Northwest Marine Technological Institute. A mark/recapture sampling effort marked a total of 80 cavefish over a six month period, ranging in size from 8 to 65 mm total length. Schnabel and Peterson population estimates yielded 92 and 72 fish, respectively. Cavefish were captured throughout the entire cave system, and moved throughout the entire system as well. Gross movements of the cavefish ranged from 1 m to 985 m. Net/gross movement ratio was higher in the upper region than the lower regions. Movement was positively correlated with size of the fish, with larger fish moving greater distances. Growth was calculated at a rate of .7 mm/month for nine fish. Two hundred and eighty-nine mean daily readings were recorded for conductivity, dissolved oxygen and temperature from Logan Cave stream, with means of 245.6 uS/cm, 6.95 mg/1, and 14.48u00b0C, respectively. Rainfall events were closely correlated with fluctuations in the Logan Cave water quality parameters. There was no significant difference (P > .05) between the water quality of Logan Cave stream and its surrounding recharge streams. All heavy metal and pesticide analysis were well below the EPA lower limits.",
