    of McBee, in southwestern Chesterfield County, SC, have provided potable water to
    more than 35,000 residents throughout Chesterfield County since the early 1990s.
    Groundwater samples collected between 2002 and 2008 in the McBee area by South Carolina
    DHEC officials indicated that groundwater from two public-supply wells was characterized
    by the anthropogenic compounds ethylene dibromide (EDB) and dibromochloropropane
    (DBCP) at concentrations that exceeded their respective maximum contaminant levels
    (MCLs) established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyu2019s (EPA) National
    Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR). Groundwater samples from all public-supply
    wells in the McBee area were characterized by the naturally occurring isotopes of
    radium-226 and 228 at concentrations that approached, and in one well exceeded,
    the MCL for the combined isotopes. The local water utility installed granulated
    activated carbon filtration units at the two EDB- and DBCP-contaminated wells and
    has, since 2011, shut down these two wells. Groundwater pumped by the remaining
    public-supply wells is currently (2014) centrally treated at a water-filtration
    plant.To assess the occurrence, distribution, and potential sources of the anthropogenic
    and naturally occurring compounds detected in groundwater in the McBee area, samples
    of groundwater and spring water were collected from public-supply, domestic-supply,
    agricultural-supply, and monitoring wells and springs, respectively, between 2010
    and 2012 by USGS. The water samples were analyzed for concentrations of EDB, DBCP,
    other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), radium-226 and radium-228, radon, and inorganic
    compounds. All wells sampled were screened in the shallow Crouch Branch aquifer,
    the deeper McQueen Branch aquifer, or, for most public-supply wells, both aquifers.
    In areas where no wells existed or wells could not be installed, passive samplers
    that adsorb EDB, DBCP, and various VOCs, were installed in the shallow subsurface.
    A representative groundwater flow pathway to each public-supply well and selected
    other wells was determined by using a calibrated three-dimensional groundwater-flow
    model of the Atlantic Coastal Plain in Chesterfield County and particle-tracking
    analysis. The aerial extent of the groundwater flow pathway to public-supply wells
    was mapped by using chlorofluorocarbon-concentration based, apparent-age dates of
    the groundwater.The water-quality data collected between 2010 and 2012, in conjunction
    with groundwater flow pathways and historical aerial photographs of land use near
    McBee, indicate an area where EDB-, DBCP-, 1,2-dichloropropane-, 1,3-dichloropropane-,
    and carbon disulfide-contaminated groundwater exists in the Crouch Branch aquifer
    in the Cedar Creek Basin and north of McBee and is most likely related to the past
    use of these compounds between the early 1900s and the 1980s as soil fumigants in
    predominately agricultural areas north of McBee. The highest EDB concentration detected
    (18.6 micrograms per liter) during the 3-year study was in a groundwater sample
    from an agricultural-supply well located north of McBee. Other VOCs, such as dichloromethane
    and 1,1,2-trichloroethane, also were detected in groundwater samples from this EDB-contaminated
    agricultural-supply well but are from unknown source(s). The fact that the agricultural
    area north of McBee is located in a recharge area for the Crouch Branch aquifer
    most likely facilitated the groundwater contamination in this area. DBCP-contaminated
    groundwater detected in three public-supply wells south of McBee in the deeper McQueen
    Branch aquifer appears to be related to past soil fumigation practices that used
    DBCP in agricultural areas located south of McBee. One of the three DBCP-contaminated
    public-supply wells also contained EDB, most likely present in groundwater due to
    the release of leaded gasolines that contained EDB as a fuel additive between the
    1940s and 1970s.",nt"owner_org": "4d7ad1cd-3641-420b-8116-e4082f49cd44",nt"extras":
