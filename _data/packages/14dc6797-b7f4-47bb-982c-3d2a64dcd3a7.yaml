    has existed for decades, and will likely increase in the future. Womens Bay has
    been and continues to be affected by industrial development, military facilities,
    spills of organic materials and non-point source activities. Numerous seafood processors
    operate along St. Paul Harbor and Near Island Channel. Eight processors received
    National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits in 1986: they may
    collectively discharge 5,888,000 gallons of wastewater daily. Two additional facilities,
    Kodiak Reduction Inc. and Cook Inlet Processing, Inc. have recently been renovated
    and are expected to commence operations soon in/near Gibson Cove. Prior to renovation
    the former facility operated without a valid NPDES permit for nearly ten years.
    Pollution of Gibson Cove was sufficiently controversial to require intervention
    by the State of Alaska Ombudsman's office. The Naval Base on Nyman Peninsula was
    converted to a Coast Guard Facility in the 1940s; it is the largest Coast Guard
    Base in Alaska and occupies virtually the entire peninsula. Numerous documented
    hydrocarbon spills and leaks have occurred at and near the facility in the last
    decade. Following a detailed inspection, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    mandated that many storage tanks and infrastructures be replaced. The U.S. Geological
    Survey simultaneously investigated potential ground water contamination from improperly
    stored/disposed materials. Womens Bay is the site of a military dumping ground that
    was presumably utilized during and after World War II. The Service presently has
    no information concerning the period of use, nor the amounts and types of materials
    disposed in these waters. An active Coast Guard landfill and abandoned U.S. Navy
    landfill produce leachates which eventually enter the Buskin River. The Buskin River,
    in turn, empties into Refuge waters. A Coast Guard (contracted) study stated that
    previous asbestos disposal was no longer a problem, but that turbidity, biochemical
    oxygen demand, and phenol were noticeably elevated (EMPS Engineering, 1984). The
    report recommended remedial measures for both the Navy and Coast Guard landfills
    to reduce leachate input to the Buskin River. Sporadic grab samples taken by federal
    and state agencies have indicated elevated levels of contaminants at specific sites
    and specific points in time. However, data have not allowed general conclusions
    about overall quality of Refuge waters and their ability to support fish and wildlife
    resources. Future development plans within Womens Bay include expansion of the Coast
    Guard facility, expansion of dock facilities for a freight transfer company, construction
    of dry-dock boat repair facilities, and expanded operation of seafood processing
    facilities. Existing and future developments have the potential to pose significant
    cumulative impacts to the fish and wildlife resources of the area. (Some of the
    potential contaminant inputs are mapped and described in Figure 3 and Table 1.)
    This study was undertaken to assess the present levels of contaminants identifiable
    in Womens Bay.",nt"owner_org": "4d7ad1cd-3641-420b-8116-e4082f49cd44",nt"extras":
