    wave height (in meters) for the given storm condition and sea-level rise (SLR) scenario.
    Model Summary: The Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS) makes detailed predictions
    (meter-scale) over large geographic scales (100s of kilometers) of storm-induced
    coastal flooding and erosion for both current and future sea-level rise (SLR) scenarios.
    CoSMoS v3.0 for Southern California shows projections for future climate scenarios
    (sea-level rise and storms) to provide emergency responders and coastal planners
    with critical storm-hazards information that can be used to increase public safety,
    mitigate physical damages, and more effectively manage and allocate resources within
    complex coastal settings. Phase I data for Southern California include flood-hazard
    information for the coast from the border of Mexico to Pt. Conception. Changes from
    the initial November 2015 release may be reflected in small areas. Data are complete
    for the information presented but are considered preliminary; additional changes
    may be reflected with model improvements made for the Phase II data release in summer
    2016. Details: Model background: The CoSMoS model comprises three tiers. Tier I
    consists of one Delft3D hydrodynamics FLOW grid for computation of tides, water
    level variations, flows, and currents and one SWAN grid for computation of wave
    generation and propagation across the continental shelf. The FLOW and SWAN models
    are two-way coupled so that tidal currents are accounted for in wave propagation
    and growth and conversely, so that orbital velocities generated by waves impart
    changes on tidal currents. The Tier I SWAN and FLOW models consist of identical
    structured curvilinear grids that extend from far offshore to the shore and range
    in resolution from 0.5 km in the offshore to 0.2 km in the nearshore. Spatially
    varying astronomic tidal amplitudes and phases and steric rises in water levels
    due to large-scale effects (for example, a prolonged rise in sea level) are applied
    along all open boundaries of the Tier I FLOW grid. Winds (split into eastward and
    northward components) and sea-level pressure (SLP) fields from CaRD10 (Dr. Dan Cayan,
    Scripps Institute of Oceanography, San Diego, California, written commun., 2014)
    that vary in both space and time are applied to all grid cells at each model time-step.
    Deep-water wave conditions, applied at the open boundaries of the Tier I SWAN model
    runs, were projected for the 21st century Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)
    4.5 climate scenario (2011-2100) using the WaveWatch III numerical wave model (Tolman
    and others, 2002) and 3-hourly winds from the GFDL-ESM2M Global Climate Model (GCM).
    Tier II provides higher resolution near the shore and in areas that require greater
    resolution of physical processes (such as bays, harbors, and estuaries). A single
    nested outer grid and multiple two-way coupled domain decomposition (DD) structured
    grids allow for local grid refinement and higher resolution where needed. Tier II
    was segmented into 11 sections along the Southern California Bight, to reduce computation
    time and complete runs within computational limitations. Water-level and Neumann
    time-series, extracted from Tier I simulations, are applied to the shore-parallel
    and lateral open boundaries of each Tier II sub-model outer grid respectively. Several
    of the sub-models proved to be unstable with lateral Neumann boundaries; for those
    cases one or both of the lateral boundaries were converted to water-level time-series
    or left unassigned. The open-boundary time-series are extracted from completed Tier
    I simulations so that there is no communication from Tier II to Tier I. Because
    this one-way nesting could produce erroneous results near the boundaries of Tier
    II and because data near any model boundary are always suspect, Tier II sub-model
    extents were designed to overlap in the along-coast direction. In the landward direction,
    Tier II DD grids extend to the 10-m topographic contour; exceptions exist where
    channels (such as the Los Angeles River) or other low-lying regions extend very
    far inland. Space- and time-varying wind and SLP fields, identical to those used
    in Tier I simulations, are applied to all Tier II DD grids to allow for wind-setup
    and local inverse barometer effects (IBE, rise or depression of water levels in
    response to atmospheric pressure gradients). A total of 42 time-series fluvial discharges
    are included in the Tier II FLOW domains in an effort to simulate exacerbated flooding
    caused by backflow at the confluence of high river seaward flows and elevated coastal
    surge levels migrating inland. Time-varying fluvial discharges are applied either
    at the closed boundaries or distributed as point sources within the relevant model
    domains. Wave computations are accomplished with the SWAN model using two grids
    for each Tier II sub-model: one larger grid covering the same area as the outer
    FLOW grid and a second finer resolution two-way coupled nearshore nested grid. The
    nearshore grid extends from approximately 800-1,000 m water depth up to 8-10 m elevations
    onshore. The landward extension is included to allow for wave computations of the
    higher SLR scenarios. Time- and space-varying 2D wave spectra extracted from previously
    completed Tier I simulations are applied approximately every kilometer along the
    open boundaries of the outer Tier II sub-model SWAN grids. The same space- and time-varying
    wind fields used in Tier I simulations are also applied to both Tier II SWAN grids
    to allow for computation of local wave generation. Tier III for the entire Southern
    California Bight consists of 4,802 cross-shore transects (CST) spaced approximately
    100 m apart in the along-shore direction. The profiles extend from the -15 m isobath
    to at least 10 m above NAVD88. The CSTs are truncated for cases where a lagoon or
    other waterway exists on the landward end of the profile. Time-varying water levels
    and wave parameters (significant wave heights, Hs; peak periods, Tp; and peak incident
    wave directions, Dp), extracted from Tier II grid cells that coincide with the seaward
    end of the CSTs, are applied at the open boundary of each CST. The XBeach model
    is run in a hydrostatic (no vertical pressure gradients) mode including event-based
    morphodynamic change. Wave propagation, two-way wave-current interaction, water-level
    variations, and wave runup are computed at each transect. XBeach simulations are
    included in the CoSMoS model to account for infragravity waves that can significantly
    extend the reach of wave runup (Roelvink and others, 2009) compared to short-wave
    incident waves. The U.S. west coast is particularly susceptible to infragravity
    waves at the shore due to breaking of long-period swell waves (Tp > 15). Resulting
    water levels (WLs) from both Delft3D (high interest bays and marshes) and open-coast
    XBeach (CSTs) were spatially combined and interpolated to a 10 m grid. These WL
    elevations are differenced from the originating 2 m digital elevation model (DEM)
    to determine final flooding extent and depth of flooding. Events: The model system
    is run for pre-determined scenarios of interest such as the 1-yr or 100-yr storm
    event in combination with sea-level rise. For Phase I, only the 100-year storm is
    run. Storms are first identified from time-series of total water level proxies (TWLpx)
    at the shore. TWLpx are computed for the majority of the 21st century (2010-2100),
    assuming a linear super-position of the major processes that contribute to the overall
    total water level. TWLpx time-series are then evaluated for extreme events, which
    define the boundary conditions for subsequent modeling with CoSMoS. Multiple 100-yr
    events are determined (varying Hs, Tp, Dp) and used for multiple model runs to better
    account for regional and directional flooding affects. Model results are combined
    and compiled into scenario-specific composites of flood projection. Digital Elevation
    Model (DEM): Our seamless, topobathymetric digital elevation model (DEM) was based
    largely upon the Coastal California TopoBathy Merge Project DEM, with some modifications
    performed by the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center to incorporate
    the most recent, high-resolution topographic and bathymetric datasets available.
    Topography is derived from bare-earth light detection and ranging (lidar) data collected
    in 2009-2011 for the CA Coastal Conservancy Lidar Project and bathymetry from 2009-2010
    bathymetric lidar as well as acoustic multi- and single-beam data collected primarily
    between 2001 and 2013. The DEM was constructed to define the shape of nearshore,
    beach, and cliff surfaces as accurately as possible, utilizing dozens of bathymetric
    and topographic data sets. These data were used to populate the majority of the
    Tier II grids and generate initial profiles of the 4,802 CSTs used for Tier III
    XBeach modeling. All data are referenced to NAD83 horizontal datum and NAVD88 vertical
    datum. Data for Tiers II and III are projected in UTM, zone 11. Outputs include:
    Projected wave height for the 100-year storm and 0.0 m sea-level rise scenario.
    Data correspond to the near-shore region including areas vulnerable to coastal flooding
    due to storm surge, sea-level anomalies, tide elevation, and wave run-up during
    the same storm and sea-level rise simulation. References Cited: Roelvink, J.A.,
