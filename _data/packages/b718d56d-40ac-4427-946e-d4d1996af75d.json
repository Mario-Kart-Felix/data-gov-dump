	"notes": "A major controversy exists over plans to develop the Parker River Wildlife Refuge in Newbury, Massachusetts. Ironically, the conflict is between the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) which manages the Refuge and chapters of several conservation groups: one local, one regional, and two national. The irony is that all the groups involved periodically have affirmed their basic shared concerns regarding environmental protection and the importance of being able to cooperate in several other areas. Despite the affirmation, the conflict, which was first reported in the press during the summer of 1978, has bred distrust and ill feeling between several of the parties. Further, it has consumed a substantial amount of resources on the part of and a lesser but not inconsequential amount of time and resources of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office and of the parties representing the conservation groups.  The development proposed by Fish and Wildlife consists of' a visitor center/office complex, maintenance facilities, up-grading of roads, boardwalks, observation blinds, and boat ramps. The plan was developed as a result of funds made available by the U.S. Congress through the bi-centennial Land Heritage Act, to be used to improve the educational and management activities on the national Wildlife Refuge's",
