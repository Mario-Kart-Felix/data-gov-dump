	"notes": "&lt;p&gt;The goal of the Protein Colloidal Aggregation project is to understand the underlying&amp;nbsp;cause of several major diseases, including&amp;nbsp;Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s, Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s, and chronic&amp;nbsp;traumatic encephalopathy. These diseases&amp;nbsp;all occur when protein molecules undergo&amp;nbsp;a peculiar and irreversible process in which&amp;nbsp;they aggregate to form tiny fibers of a unique&amp;nbsp;material called amyloid, which the body&amp;nbsp;cannot remove.&amp;nbsp;Despite enormous investment in research,&amp;nbsp;the fundamental physiochemical mechanism of&amp;nbsp;these diseases remains poorly understood.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on initial studies using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we theorized that the aggregation of proteins in these diseases is driven instead by colloidal interactions, the same forces that govern the behavior&amp;nbsp;of nanoscale particles in the colloidal suspensions we encounter every day, such as paint, milk, and clouds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our theory is being validated by the evidence. For many years, NASA has been heavily involved in research into the structure of proteins and their assembly into crystals, and in studying the colloidal interactions and aggregation of nanoscale particles. To date, however, NASA&amp;rsquo;s colloid research has involved&amp;nbsp;only nonbiological materials.&amp;nbsp;But now we&amp;nbsp;are bridging these two fields by studying the colloidal aggregation of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
