	"notes": "This is the updated Malheur National Wildlife Refuge Master Plan and  Environmental Assessment. It replaces the former Master Plan Technical  Report that was prepared in March 1965. The major purpose of this report is to update refuge objectives in accordance with a more current assessment of refuge resource capabilities and changes in applicable laws and policies affecting management of the National Wildlife Refuge System. It should be noted that this Master Plan updating process was well along and many of the planning materials prepared prior to completion and issuance to the field of the Master Planning Workbook for the Refuge System in August 1980. While we have made an effort to integrate the results of our earlier planning efforts into the procedures outlined in the Workbook, the format of our plan and planning materials is not the same in all cases. The report also outlines in general terms the long-range management strategy that will be used in fulfilling revised refuge objectives. This is, by definition, a narrative statement of the management and development activities required to implement decisions made in master planning. It serves as the principle guide for developing detailed,  short-term refuge management and operational plans. Three alternative levels of management and associated strategies were developed and presented in this plan: No Funds Increase, Custodial Maintenance, and the Preferred Alternative. The Preferred Alternative management strategy is the alternative the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service feels would best satisfy wildlife resource and public needs, while remaining consistent with legal mandates, national direction, and the resource capabilities of the Refuge. The Preferred Alternative is based on the assumption that funding will be available to permit a refuge operation that will ultimately produce the desired objective levels. Management would be directed at preserving natural environments of the refuge, maintaining aesthetic qualities, emphasizing habitat diversity, introducing native flora and fauna, maintaining an optimum mix of compatible public uses, and completing acquisition of about 3,681 acres of privately owned and 5,009 acres of public land adjacent or within the boundary of the refuge, on a willing seller or exchange basis. The Preferred Alternative follows a comprehensive management approach, which prescribes that the Fish and Wildlife Service has an active interest and responsibility in helping to preserve the migratory bird habitat associated with the entire Harney Basin. That responsibility recognizes the important role off-refuge lands play in support of total migratory bird habitat values of the Basin. Under this alternative, use of livestock grazing, haying, prescribed burning, and other necessary management tools will be made, as appropriate to the needs of refuge habitats and animal population management programs. The draft plan was released for public review and comment during the summer of 1983. Copies were distributed to Federal, State and local agencies, a wide variety of environmental groups, and local citizens. This final version was revised to address the comments and suggestions received from the public. Five written comments were received. All supported the Preferred Alternative. As outlined in 4 RM 3, following the completion of the Master Plan, the refuge management planning process will move on to the development of unit-specific objectives and strategies. During this effort, master plan objectives and strategies will be matched to the innate potential of each unit to provide the optimum mix of outputs. Specific plans for comprehensive habitat, water, and public use management, will be developed as appropriate.",
