    on fish and benthic communities within the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary
    (FGBNMS). Surveys employed diving, technical diving, ROV, and hydroacoustics technologies
    for a comprehensive assessment of the fish and benthic habitat communities of the
    East and West Bank. The FGBNMS represents the northernmost tropical western Atlantic
    coral reef on the continental shelf and support the most highly developed offshore
    hard bank community in the region. The complexity of habitats supports a diverse
    assemblage of organisms including approximately 250 species of fish, 23 species
    of coral, and 80 species of algae in addition to large sponge communities. Understanding
    and monitoring these resources is critical to both sanctuary inventory and management
    activities. During the course of the sanctuary's management plan review process,
    the impact of fishing was identified as a priority issue, and the concept of a research
    only area was suggested. The purpose of this project will be to provide baseline
    data for all benthic habitats and communities.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
