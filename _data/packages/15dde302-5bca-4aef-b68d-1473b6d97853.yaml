  geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore of Bodega Head map area, California.
  The vector data file is included in \"Geology_OffshoreBodegaHead.zip,\" which is
  accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreBodegaHead/data_catalog_OffshoreBodegaHead.html.
  The morphology and the geology of the Offshore of Bodega Head map area result from
  the interplay between tectonics, sea-level rise, local sedimentary processes, and
  oceanography. The Offshore of Bodega Head map area is cut by the northwest-trending
  San Andreas Fault, the right-lateral transform boundary between the North American
  and Pacific tectonic plates. From southeast to northwest, this fault extends through
  Bodega Bay and Bodega Harbor, crosses the Bodega Head isthmus at the mouth of Salmon
  Creek, and extends in the offshore for about 20 km before passing onland at Fort
  Ross, about 12 km north of the Offshore of Bodega Head map area. The San Andreas
  Fault juxtaposes Cretaceous granitic rock on the southwest with the Jurassic, Cretaceous,
  and early Tertiary Franciscan Complex on the northeast. Uplift of the granitic rock
  (unit Kg) on the west side of the San Andreas Fault has created extensive, rugged,
  rocky seafloor, centered offshore Bodega Head and extending northwest for about
  15 km, from the western flank of Bodega Bay to the shelf offshore of the mouth of
  Salmon Creek. At its south and north ends this rocky seafloor extends to water depths
  of about 40 m and 50 m, respectively where it is onlapped by young sediment (see
  below); offshore of Bodega Head, the rocky seafloor extends to water depths of 80
  m. Northeast of the San Andreas Fault, offshore rocky outcrops of the Franciscan
  complex (units Kfs, Kjfss, fsr) occur only in the nearshore (water depths less than
  15 m). Sediment-covered areas of the offshore part of the map occur in gently sloping
  (less than about 1 degree) nearshore, inner-, and mid-shelf environments. Sediment
  supply to the shelf north and west of Bodega Head is predominantly from coastal
  watersheds including the Russian River (4.5 km north of the map area) and Salmon
  Creek. Sediment supply to Bodega Bay and the shelf in the southern part of the map
  area is from small coastal watersheds and estuaries such as Estero Americano and
  Estero de San Antonio, and most likely from sediment flux out of the mouth of Tomales
  Bay, located two kilometers south of the map area. Shelf morphology and evolution
  largely reflects eustacy; sea level has risen about 125 to 130 m over about the
  last 21,000 years (for example, Lambeck and Chappell, 2001; Peltier and Fairbanks,
  2005), leading to broadening of the continental shelf, progressive eastward migration
  of the shoreline and wave-cut platform, and associated transgressive erosion and
  deposition. Given present exposure to high wave energy, modern nearshore to inner-shelf
  sediments are mostly sand (unit Qms) and a mix of sand, gravel, and cobbles (units
  Qmsc and Qmsd). The more coarse-grained sands and gravels (units Qmsc and Qmsd)
  are primarily recognized on the basis of bathymetry and high backscatter. Unit Qmsc
  occurs in two areas: (1) as a linear nearshore bar (water depth less than 10 m)
  offshore of Salmon Creek - the eastern contact of this unit is queried because of
  the lack of data in the surf zone; and (2) as a west-trending bar at the north end
  of Bodega Bay. Unit Qmsd forms erosional lags in scoured depressions that are bounded
  by relatively sharp contacts with bedrock or sharp to diffuse contacts with unit
  Qms. These scoured depressions are typically a few tens of centimeters deep and
  range in size from a few 10's of sq m to more than one sq km. Similar unit Qmsd
  scour depressions are common along this stretch of the California coast (see, for
  example, Cacchione and others, 1984; Hallenbeck and others, 2012) where surficial
  offshore sandy sediment is relatively thin (thus unable to fill the depressions)
  due to both lack of sediment supply and to erosion and transport of sediment during
  large northwest winter swells. Such features have been referred to as \"rippled-scour
  depressions\" (see, for example, Cacchione and others, 1984) or \"sorted bedforms\"
  (see, for example, Goff and others, 2005; Trembanis and Hume, 2011). Although the
  general areas in which both unit Qmsd scour depressions and surrounding mobile sand
  sheets occur are not likely to change substantially, the boundaries of the individual
  Qmsd depressions are likely ephemeral, changing seasonally and during significant
  storm events. Unit Qmsf lies offshore of unit Qms, consists primarily of mud and
  muddy sand and is commonly extensively bioturbated. The water depth of the transition
  from sand-dominated marine sediment (unit Qms) to mud-dominated marine sediment
  (Qmsf) occurs at depths of about 45 to 50 m except offshore of Bodega Head where
  seafloor bedrock outcrops extend to depths of 80 m at the outer limit of California's
  State Waters. The smooth seafloor in the northern part of the map area between water
  depths of 40 m and 70 m notably includes an about 3-km-wide field of elongate, shore-normal,
  paired sediment lobes and chutes (unit Qmsl). Individual lobes within the field
  are as much as 1,000-m long and 150-m wide, and have as much as 2 m of relief above
  the surrounding smooth seafloor. This sediment-lobe field lies just one kilometer
  west of the San Andreas Fault and we infer that large earthquakes on this structure
  generated strong ground motions and slope failures, mobilizing small sediment flows
  that moved down the gentle slope and were deposited as lobes. Unit Qmsl also occurs
  as a 250-m-wide field of four discrete lobes and paired arcuate, low-relief scours
  on the south flank of a west-trending bar in northern Bodega Bay. Map unit polygons
  were digitized over underlying 2-meter base layers developed from multibeam bathymetry
  and backscatter data (see Bathymetry--Offshore Bodega Head, California and Backscattter
  A to C--Offshore Bodega Head, California, DS 781, for more information). The bathymetry
  and backscatter data were collected between 2007 and 2010. References Cited Cacchione,
