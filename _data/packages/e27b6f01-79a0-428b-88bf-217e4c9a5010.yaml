    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "An inherently rugged Universal Oscillator
    (UO) is needed to enable a superior class of configurable communications for NASA
    applications. The requirements are a low phase noise RF output concurrently with
    a rugged, reliable, small, power efficient, and frequency tuning ability. VIDA Products
    has developed technology that will ultimately enable an integrated circuit YIG oscillator
    with high Q resonators and low power consumption that fills these requirements.
    The high Q YIG resonators are made possible by quantum electron spin precession
    and are essentially lossless. In general, a resonator is realized by a YIG sphere
    RF magnetic fields coupling to the oscillator circuit structure.  A bias magnetic
    field on the spheres at a right angle to the coupling field vector sets the frequency
    of operation. It is a linear function of exactly 2.8 MHz per Gauss. Its equivalent
    electrical circuit is composed of circuit elements unrealizable by finite components
    that vary over frequency so the filter bandwidth does not change with tuned frequency.
    Thus the Q increases with frequency since a definition of Q is the tuned frequency
    divided by the bandwidth. For oscillators using these resonators the phase noise
    is excellent and continues to perform as the oscillation frequency increases. The
    Resonant Ring Oscillator topology is easily realizable using MMIC technology to
    reduce a YIG based oscillator to a single IC with the ability to produce external
    fields of the correct vectors and path losses.  To make use of this phenomenon,
    a proprietary circuit utilizing leakage shielding and frequency locking will control
    the magnetic bias field and be integrated in the UO IC. The result will be a Universal
    Oscillator that can be produced to operate at any frequency between 3 and 30 GHz
    at cost equivalent to current VCO technology but with 30 to 40 dBc improvement in
    phase noise performance. Completing the development of this technology now will
    save immeasurable resources.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
