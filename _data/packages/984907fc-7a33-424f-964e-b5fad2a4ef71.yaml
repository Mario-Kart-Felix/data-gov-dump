    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "On October 17, 1989, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake
    occurred near Loma Prieta in the Santa Cruz Mountains. This earthquake is also known
    as the "San Francisco World Series Earthquake." The slide set focuses on the effects
    in San Francisco and Oakland. It highlights the damage in the Marina area of San
    Francisco. The set also includes photographs in the area south of Market Street
    where five deaths occurred, the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, and the Nimitz
    Freeway (I-880) where 41 deaths occurred. Movement occurred along a 40-km segment
    of the San Andreas fault from southwest of Los Gatos to north of San Juan Bautista.
    Measurements along the surface of the Earth after the earthquake show that the Pacific
    plate moved 1.9 m to the northwest and 1.3 m upward over the North American plate.
    The upward motion resulted from deformation of the plate boundary at the bend in
    the San Andreas fault. At the surface the fault motion was evident as a complex
    series of cracks and fractures. Even though the earthquake occurred in the remote
    Santa Cruz Mountains, it caused severe damage in San Francisco and Oakland 80 km
    to the north. This is somewhat unusual for an earthquake of this magnitude. Some
    of the statistical results of the disaster were: more than $7 billion in property
    damage (2.5 billion in San Francisco alone), 414 single-family homes destroyed,
    104 mobile homes destroyed, 18,306 homes damaged, 97 businesses and 3 public buildings
    destroyed, 2,575 businesses damaged, 12,000 people displaced from homes and housed
    in shelters, 3,757 injuries, and 67 deaths. One of the areas in San Francisco that
    sustained major damage was the Marina District. This area was a lagoon at the time
    of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. During that earthquake the margins of the
    lagoon shook violently.However, after the 1906 earthquake, the lagoon was filled
    with sand and rubble of destroyed buildings to make a fairground for the 1915 Panama-Pacific
    International Exposition. This fill area later became the site of an expensive real-estate
    development known as the Marina District. The unconsolidated soils amplified the
    shaking and became liquefied (behaved like a dense fluid) causing permanent deformation
    of the ground. This was one of the causes of the increased damage in the area. Construction
    practices also contributed to the damage. Some four-story buildings built above
    garages had inadequate lateral bracing. Thirty-five of the buildings in the Marina
    District were eventually torn down and 150 others were structurally damaged. The
    two major causes of structural failures were poor soil conditions and inadequate
    structural design. South of Market Street, several buildings between 5 and 10 stories
    high were damaged. Old masonry buildings were badly damaged, including a warehouse
    where collapse of fourth floor exterior walls killed five people parked in cars
    along the street. There were also severely damaged buildings in the Mission District.
    In Oakland, severe damage occurred to several mid-rise buildings and many old brick
    buildings in the downtown area. Primarily due to the effects of liquefaction, buried
    underground utilities such as gas pipelines, water lines, and sewer lines were heavily
    damaged. This left about one thousand homes without gas or water. As in the 1906
    earthquake, fires in the Marina District could not be fought with city water because
    water mains had failed.One of the sources for concern produced by the earthquake
    is the damage or failure of transportation systems at comparatively large distances
    from the epicenter. The most deadly structural failure of the earthquake occurred
    when the upper deck of the Interstate 880 (Nimitz Freeway) in Oakland fell onto
    the lower roadway causing an official death toll of 41. Another spectacular failure
    occurred on the Oakland Bay Bridge. Interstate 280, the Embarcadero Freeway, and
    Highway 101 at Fell Street were also damaged. In Oakland, Highway 980 and the MacArthur
    Maze developed cracks in the support columns. It will cost about $1.5 billion to
    rebuild state and local roads damaged in the earthquake. In addition to damage to
    roads, the Oakland International Airport, naval port, and the Alameda Naval Air
    Station runways were damaged by liquefaction. It is interesting to compare this
    earthquake with the slightly smaller (magnitude 6.9) Armenian earthquake of December
    1988 that killed 25,000 people and destroyed entire towns. Good construction and
    engineering practices in the Loma Prieta area obviously contributed to the preservation
    of property and human lives.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
