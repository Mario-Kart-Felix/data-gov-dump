    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "This proposal is for funding to continue
    development of an alternative beam combiner for Stellar Imager (SI), a 30-aperture,
    interferometric telescope chosen as one of fifteen Vision Missions.  Called the
    Spatial Frequency Remapper, SFR, it trades the large field of view of a Fizeau design
    for simultaneous observations at multiple wavelengths.  Since SI does not require
    a large field, SFR, is a clearly better design.  It can produce better images and
    allows tight control requirements to be relaxed.  The SFR is also the heart of a
    full-aperture interferometric imaging system that will dramatically improve the
    performance of AO equipped telescopes.rnrnThe Phase I study was remarkably successful.
     The SFR design was rejected during the Vision Study because of its perceived optical
    complexity.  That concern was retired; the design is robust, even with many apertures.
     It needs only three optical surfaces, down from the five-surface design of the
    Vision Study.  Tolerances are not tight.  The inputs can be divided between combiners,
    further simplifying the optics and data flow with negligible effect on mission performance.rnrnThe
    search for better sparse-aperture configurations worked.  The search was sped up
    1000 fold, enabling the discovery of the 30-aperture configurations needed for SI.rnrnThe
    main commercial application, improving images from AO equipped telescopes, requires
    a seemingly impossible to build optical fiber interface.  We found an alternative
    assembly procedure that is standing up well to detailed study.  A data reduction
    technique was developed that should improve sensitivity by a factor of 1000, increasing
    the range of possible applications.  The configuration search found ways to divide
    a full-aperture into the multiple configurations, tying off another loose thread
    in the design.rnrnFinally, a testbed and prototyping plan was developed since in
    our view the success of the Phase I study clearly supports continuing the development
    of this technology.rn",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
