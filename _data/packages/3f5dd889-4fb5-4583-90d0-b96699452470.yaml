    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Regression problems on massive data sets
    are ubiquitous in many application domains including the Internet, earth and space
    sciences, and finances. In many cases, regression algorithms such as linear regression
    or neural networks attempt to fit the target variable as a function of the input
    variables without regard to the underlying joint distribution of the variables.
    As a result, these global models are not sensitive to variations in the local structure
    of the input space. Several algorithms, including the mixture of experts model,
    classification and regression trees (CART), and others have been developed, motivated
    by the fact that a variability in the local distribution of inputs may be reflective
    of a significant change in the target variable. While these methods can handle the
    non-stationarity in the relationships to varying degrees, they are often not scalable
    and, therefore, not used in large scale data mining applications. In this paper
    we develop Block-GP, a Gaussian Process regression framework for multimodal data,
    that can be an order of magnitude more scalable than existing state-of-the-art nonlinear
    regression algorithms. The framework builds local Gaussian Processes on semantically
    meaningful partitions of the data and provides higher prediction accuracy than a
    single global model with very high confidence. The method relies on approximating
    the covariance matrix of the entire input space by smaller covariance matrices that
    can be modeled independently, and can therefore be parallelized for faster execution.
    Theoretical analysis and empirical studies on various synthetic and real data sets
    show high accuracy and scalability of Block-GP compared to existing nonlinear regression
    techniques.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
