    backscatter mosaic of the bathymetry of a reef shelf/bank and the steep slopes and
    canyons of the NE Reserve, offshore of Fajardo, Puerto Rico. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA
    Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory,
    federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the
    Northeast Reserve from 4/04/2012 to 4/20/2012. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted
    Reson 7125 multibeam echosounder (400 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using
    CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity)
    and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from
    NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The backscatter component
    of the bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using .HSX
    and .7k file pairs in Fledermaus Geocoder Toolbox7.3.3. Acoustic backscatter mosaics
    are ostensibly an important piece of information when characterizing surficial seafloor
    features and delineating benthic habitats. The project was conducted to meet IHO
    Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users
    should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own
    needs and standards.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
