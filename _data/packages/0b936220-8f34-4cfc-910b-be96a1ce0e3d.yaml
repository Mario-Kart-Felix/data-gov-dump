  false,\n\t\"url\": null,\n\t\"notes\": \"Short-term, static exposure toxicity tests
  were conducted in the New Jersey Field Office laboratory to evaluate the potential
  for the water accommodated fractions of Arab light crude oil (which is transported
  in large quantities through Delaware Bay) and Corexit.9527 (the most commonly used
  dispersant in the United States) to adversely affect gametes, fertilization and
  early post-fertilization development of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus. Gametes
  were obtained from adult horseshoe crabs using a modified \"Arbacia stimulator.
  \" This method yielded sufficient viable gametes for toxicity tests without harming
  the adults. Eggs and sperm were exposed to seawater or one of five concentrations
  (four replicates / concentration) of oil, 1:10 dispersant:oil mix, or dispersant
  only. Toxicant solutions were prepared using methods described in the National Oil
  Spill Contingency Plan (40 CFR Parts 9 and 300). Measured concentrations of total
  petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in exposure water prepared with oil only ranged from
  < 1.0 ppm to 4.8 ppm. In addition, concentrations of total polynuclear aromatic
  hydrocarbons (PAHs) ranged from < 0.0002 to 0.045 ppm and the summed concentrations
  of the volatile monoaromatic hydrocarbons (BTEX) ranged from < 0.01 to 0.18 ppm.
  In exposure water prepared with oil and dispersant, TPH concentrations ranged from
  < 1.0 to 88 ppm, concentrations of total PAHs ranged from <0.0002 to 0.600 and summed
  concentrations of volatile compounds ranged from <0.01 to 0.74 ppm. Dispersant concentrations
  were not measured. Nominal dispersant concentrations ranged from 1.0 to 100 ppm.
  Maximum total PAH concentrations and all the nominal dispersant concentrations used
  in this study exceeded adverse effect levels reported for sensitive marine species.
  Toxicant exposure lasted 24 hours after which embryos were maintained in clean water.
  Chambers were checked at the beginning of exposure for evidence of sperm viability
  (activation upon introduction to eggs) and fertilization success (granulation and
  percent viable embryos after 48 hours). After transfer to clean water, chambers
  were monitored for evidence of successful development to the blastula stage. At
  25u00b0C, development proceeded to early stages of germ disc formation before observations
  were terminated. Exposure to dispersant resulted in activation of sperm even when
  eggs were not present. The threshold concentration of Corexit 9527 for this effect
  was between 10 and 50 ppm. In the field, the timing of egg and sperm release is
  such that activation stimulated by dispersant is not considered to be an adverse
  effect. Sperm were activated by the presence of eggs even during exposure to the
  most concentrated oil, dispersant and oil, or dispersant test solutions used. The
  fraction of eggs that was successfully fertilized during exposure to toxicant mixtures
  (approximately 80%) was not different from that observed in controls. The percentages
  of viable embryos observed after 48 hours were the same as percentages that reached
  the blastula stage of development (approximately 96 hours), suggesting that (1)
  development to the blastula stage was not affected by initial exposure to toxicant
  mixtures, and (2) viability at 48 hours may be a reasonable index of the potential
  for successful development to later stages. It is concluded that gametes, fertilization
  and early embryonic development of the horseshoe crab were not adversely affected
  by exposure to water mixed with arab light crude oil, Arab light crude oil and Corexit
  9527, or Corexit 9527 alone, even when total PAH and dispersant concentrations in
  some test mixtures exceeded levels that are toxic to sensitive marine species.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
