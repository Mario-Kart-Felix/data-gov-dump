ACLO components will be developed for mission-relevant cryogenic platforms/environment (i.e., ground-based and micro-g in-space capability) and demonstrated against the KSC Cryogenic Test Facility&amp;rsquo;s Simulated Propellant Loading System, a.k.a, the Cryogenic Testbed. The autonomous cryogenic loading capability and component technologies developed under the ACLO Project Element will be used to help mature concepts for variable levels of autonomy and will enable NASA to rapidly adapt to and support various launch concepts with multiple vehicle types in a multi-use launch pad or an in-space environment. The ACLO Project Element will continue to build on capabilities and concepts developed and/or demonstrated in FY13 under ACLO and previous ground autonomy and health management efforts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Systems Autonomy Demonstration Program: Knowledge-based Autonomous Test Engineer (KATE), which proved the feasibility of using high-fidelity physics models and simulations to enable integrated system health, status and control for autonomous tank loading operations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Constellation pathfinder demonstrations and trade studies: Ares I-X Ground Diagnostic Prototype &amp;amp; Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery Architecture Prototype, which developed a certifiable configuration and approach for integrated health management for ground and launch operations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AFRL Future Responsive Access to Space Technologies Program: Rapid Propellant Loading Project, which developed concepts for distributed launch operations and cryogenic loading operations using KATE and the Hybrid Diagnostic Engine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
