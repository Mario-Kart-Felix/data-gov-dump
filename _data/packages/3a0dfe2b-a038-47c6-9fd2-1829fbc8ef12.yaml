  structures and are increasingly being adopted into newer designs. However, it is
  also acknowledged that given current understanding of damage mechanisms in composites
  there is a significant risk with the extensive use of composites materials in aerospace
  applications. On one hand the uncertainty in damage evolution along lifetime is
  extremely large, and on the other hand there is a lack of knowledge about the mechanics
  of the onset, posterior growth, and interactions between several micro-scale damage
  modes. All these factors lead to the adoption of high safety margins in the design
  and costly inspection schedules along the service to mitigate the risks. Structural
  health monitoring for onboard damage diagnosis and prognosis of structural failures
  has the potential to reduce maintenance costs and improve the safety of the structure
  through a condition based maintenance scheduling. In this scheme the current damage
  state of a specific structural element is estimated and further used as the input
  for a prognostic algorithm that predicts the propagation of damage through time
  using updated models and based on some knowledge of the future load conditions.rnrnA
  novel damage prognostics framework for composites FRP under fatigue loadings is
  proposed in this work. The proposed methodology is grounded on physics-based models
  for evolution of damage at (1) micro-scale, i.e. micro-cracks and delamination,
  and (2) macro-scale such as stiffness reduction induced by micro-scale damage modes.
  Through stochastic embedding, these apriori deterministic models are converted to
  probabilistic models by introducing a modeling error term. This error term is controlled
  by a probability density function whose parameters are estimated in addition to
  the rest of \"physical\" parameters. The probabilistic damage models  are then incorporated
  in a Bayesian filtering algorithm that sequentially updates both, a damage state
  variable and the set of model parameters, as fresh damage data become available
  along the fatigue cycling process. Next, these damage models are used to simulate
  fault propagation with this updated state information to generate a prognostic estimate
  of the remaining useful life of the structure in a probabilistic sense. The proposed
  methodology is demonstrated using experimental NDE damage data for micro-crack density,
  delamination area, and stiffness reduction from an extensive post-impact tension-tension
  fatigue test performed over several CFRP [0,90]4s laminates.rn\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
