  national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile
  is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to
  cover the entire nation.  Linear Water Features includes single-line drainage water
  features and artificial path features that run through double-line drainage features
  such as rivers and streams, and serve as a linear representation of these features.
  \ The artificial path features may correspond to those in the USGS National Hydrographic
  Dataset (NHD).  However, in many cases the features do not match NHD equivalent
  feature and will not carry the NHD metadata codes.  These features have a MAF/TIGER
  Feature Classification Code (MTFCC) beginning with an \"H\" to indicate the super
