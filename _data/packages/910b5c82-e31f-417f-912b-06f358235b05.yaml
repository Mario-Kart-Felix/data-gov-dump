    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "As part of the NASA goal of "locating and
    characterizing lunar volatile resources", Honeybee Robotics proposes to investigate
    two novel technologies that both are powered by a new monopropellant, NOFB3, developed
    by Firestar Engineering. Honeybee will test key concepts for a pneumatic drill,
    intended for use in the lunar cold traps, and will also investigate a method for
    mining the top few centimeters of lunar regolith with a gas system that has no moving
    parts. rnAnalogous to the high-powered drilling done on Earth, the proposed pneumatic
    drill will derive its mechanical power from a chemical fuel (NOFB3), and it will
    use a fluid (in this case, low temperature exhaust gases extracted from the power
    system) to remove drill cuttings. A drill of this sort will have a number of advantages
    over traditional electromechanical drill/auger systems, including reduced power
    consumption, lower mass, less mechanical complexity, and better durability at extreme
    temperatures. In Phase I, the team proposes to investigate the production of mechanical
    power from the monopropellant via a small turbine, and, separately, to study removal
    of cuttings with gas flow while drilling in a laboratory vacuum chamber.rnThe second
    part of the proposed research will be to investigate a method for mining the top
    few centimeters of lunar regolith using a method similar to "jet-lift dredging".
    This method will use a stream of gas, also provided by the partial decomposition
    of NOFB3, to draw simulated lunar regolith into a delivery pipe connected to a storage
    bin. The system has no moving parts and is thus well suited for the abrasive lunar
    environment.rnThe proposed coupled propulsion/pneumatic system for excavation and
    prospecting will enable robust, rapid, subsurface access into an in-situ medium,
    and particularly into permanently shadowed regions on the moon without requiring
    solar illumination, potentially large nuclear power systems, or potentially complicated
    distributed power systems. rn",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
