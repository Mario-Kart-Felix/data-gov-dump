    principles have considerable promise to change the game of lifecycle cost of engineering
    systems at high safety levels by providing a reliable estimate of future system
    states. This estimate is a key for planning and decision making in an operational
    setting. While technology solutions have made considerable advances, the tie-in
    into the systems engineering process is lagging behind, which delays fielding of
    PHM-enabled systems. The derivation of specifications from high level requirements
    for algorithm performance to ensure quality predictions is not well developed. From
    an engineering perspective some key parameters driving the requirements for prognostics
    performance include: (1) maximum allowable Probability of Failure (PoF) of the prognostic
    system to bound the risk of losing an asset, (2) tolerable limits on proactive maintenance
    to minimize missed opportunity of asset usage, (3) lead time to specify the amount
    of advanced warning needed for actionable decisions, and (4) required confidence
    to specify when prognosis is sufficiently good to be used. This paper takes a systems
    engineering view towards the requirements specification process and presents a method
    for the flowdown process. A case study based on an electric Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
    (e-UAV) scenario demonstrates how top level requirements for performance, cost,
    and safety flow down to the health management level and specify quantitative requirements
    for prognostic algorithm performance.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
