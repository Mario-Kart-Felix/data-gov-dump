    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;rntEvidence of nitrogen tetroxide
    (NTO) and monomethylhydrazine (MMH) propellant vapor leakage across the primary
    and secondary shafts seals of the four OMS-E series valve ball valve pinions have
    been found on nearly all OMS engines processed at the NASA White Sands Test Facility
    since 1996. This leakage results in various forms of internal damage to series valve
    ball valve pinions and actuator assembly components.&amp;nbsp; Two in-flight anomalies
    occurred during Shuttle flight history (STS-91 OMS-E serial number [S/N] 107; and
    STS-101 on OMS-E S/N 111) that were direct results of propellant vapor leakage.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntTesting
    was performed in FY 2012 and 2013 to attempt to characterize/determine the conditions
    under which the vapors migrate/permeate past the redundant (primary and secondary)
    shafts seals on the ball valve pinions and into the actuator housings.&amp;nbsp;
    In FY 2012 a &amp;ldquo;simple soak&amp;rdquo; test was performed in which NTO and
    MMH were introduced into their respective cavities in a flight series valve and
    vapor break-through monitored downstream of the primary and secondary shaft seals
    of each of the four ball valves using vapor detection devices.&amp;nbsp; The follow-on
    testing performed in FY 2013 focuses on the MMH part of the series valve.&amp;nbsp;
    In this test, MMH is introduced into the cavity between the fuel ball valves, the
    cavity pressurized to 250 pounds per square inch gage (psig), and monitoring performed
    downstream of the primary and secondary shaft seals using vapor detection devices.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntFY
    2012 soak tests resulted in evidence of NTO vapor permeation past the primary and
    secondary shaft seals of the oxidizer ball valves in 2.5 and 18.5 hours respectively.&amp;nbsp;
    While MMH vapor permeation was measured at the primary shaft seal locations of the
    fuel ball valves in 1.5 hours, no evidence of permeation past the secondary shaft
    seal was measured after 6 weeks of data logging.&amp;nbsp; This resulted in the
    follow-on test in FY 2013 to add pressurization of the fuel ball valve cavity to
    determine if this would result in MMH vapor measurements downstream of the fuel
    ball valve secondary shaft seal locations.&amp;nbsp; FY 2013 testing will be completed
    by September 2013 and results compiled in a test report.&lt;/p&gt;rn",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
