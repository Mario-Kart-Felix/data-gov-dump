	"notes": "Cornerstone Research Group Inc. (CRG) will develop an advanced reflexive structure technology system to increase the survivability of future systems constructed of lightweight composite structures. Application of this innovation will apply to a broad selection of high performance systems ranging from aircraft and spacecraft to habitats for space stations and interplanetary exploration.  The control system for the reflexive structures will mimic the pain withdrawal-reflex on which the human body relies. This is important because rapid response is critical to survivability. The proposed reflexive system will incorporate a continuous health and performance monitoring system via embedded piezoelectric sensors, an adaptive composite structure based on CRG's shape memory composite material (Veritex&lt;SUP&gt;TM&lt;/SUP&gt;), and an intelligence system which will be interfaced with both the health/performance sensors and the adaptive structure. When activated, the adaptive composite will recover its structural integrity via shape recovery and a novel healing process.  The development of a reflexive structural system will enable increased safety and security and demonstrate a better understanding of integrated performance systems.  ",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
