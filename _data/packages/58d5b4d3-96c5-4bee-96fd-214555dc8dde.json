	"notes": "The goal of rHEALTH sensor is a universal handheld sensor that can provide rapid, low-cost complete blood count (CBC) with differential, electrolyte analysis, and potential for advanced lab tests such as biomarker analysis all in one single microfluidic sensor.  The first innovation is that the device can perform multiple lab measurements in a single microfluidic device.  Most sensors can only perform one test at a time, such as CBC analysis.  Adequate health monitoring requires at the minimum measurement of CBC and electrolytes.  Second, our microfluidic chip is reusable because of its flow-through design.  This minimizes cost and obviates the need for bulky consumables.  Third, our sensor uses fluorescent analyte sensing dyes and fluorescence technology, which allows the sensor to measure a broad range of analytes.  In Phase I, we plan to fabricate a prototype microfluidic sensor and test it for its ability to perform both CBC and electrolyte measurements.  Upon proof-of-principle, in Phase II, our goal is to complete and deliver a prototype rHEALTH sensor for NASA to monitor astronaut health on a routine and cost-effective basis.rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
