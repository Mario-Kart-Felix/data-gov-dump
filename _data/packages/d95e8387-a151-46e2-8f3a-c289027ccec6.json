		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

	"notes": "This data set is a subset of a 0.5-degree gridded temperature and precipitation data set for South America (Willmott and Webber 1998). This subset was created for the study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA), defined as 10 N to 25 S, 30 to 85 W. The data are in ASCII GRID format. The data consist of the following: Monthly mean air temperature time series (1960-1990), in degrees C: monthly mean air temperatures for 1960-1990 cross validation errors associated with time series monthly mean air temperatures for 1960-1990, DEM assisted interpolation cross validation errors associated with DEM assisted interpolation time series Monthly mean air temperature climatology, in degrees C: climatic means of monthly and annual air temperatures cross validation errors associated with climatic means climatic means of monthly and annual mean air temperatures, DEM assisted interpolation cross validation errors associated with DEM assisted interpolation climatic means Monthly total precipitation time series (1960-1990), in millimeters: monthly precipitation totals for 1960-1990 cross validation errors associated with time series monthly precipitation totals for 1960-1990, climatologically aided interpolation cross validation errors associated with climatologically aided interpolation time series Monthly total precipitation climatology, in millimeters: climatic means of monthly and annual precipitation totals cross validation errors associated with climatic means More information about the full data set can be found at "Willmott, Matsuura, and Collaborators' Global Climate Resource Pages" (http://climate.geog.udel.edu/~climate) at the University of Delaware. To obtain the original documentation and data, follow the link for "Available Climate Data," register or sign in, and follow the link for "South American Climate Data."
