	"notes": "The key innovation in this project is the implementation of an Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer (IFTS) for in situ metal additive manufacturing process monitoring. In this Phase I STTR project, Mound Laser &amp; Photonics Center, a developer of laser based additive manufacturing processing, will collaborate with the Air Force Institute of Technology, with expertise and innovative hardware for spectroscopy, to implement the IFTS in a Selective Laser Melting (SLM) R&amp;D test bed to demonstrate advanced strategies for process control and in situ quality assurance such as: (1) automatic detection of the molten area in various layers, (2) in situ release of stresses induced by temperature gradients, and (3) real-time control of alloy composition and minimization of contaminants.  These capabilities with facilitate the manufacture of parts with complex geometries with improved microstructures and properties.rnrnIn Phase I we intend to: (1) prove the utility of the IFTS for monitoring SLM processing of metals and alloys, (2) determine surface temperatures with a statistical accuracy of better than 4 oC, systematic accuracy of better than 10 oC and a dynamic range of up to 2000 oC, and provide rapid (1 kHz), automatic identification of the molten area, (3) track changes in chemical composition due to evaporation, oxidation, and melt expulsion, (4) reduce data  dimensionality and correlate these IFTS sensor features with manufacture quality metrics, and (5) design the concept for a Phase II prototype sensor suite that focuses on key aspects of the IFTS datascape to inexpensively emulate the IFTS.  In Phase II, a prototype optical sensor will be developed for process control  of metallic additive manufacture of lightweight, reliable, low cost structures.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
