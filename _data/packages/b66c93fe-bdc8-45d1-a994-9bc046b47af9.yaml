    was conducted during 1992 in the south San Diego Bay area to evaluate potential
    hazards to trustee resources and/or liabilities to the Service. Potential contaminant
    problems were urban runoff and pollutants associated with shipyards and marinas,
    and the fact that elevated levels of metals and petroleum hydrocarbons are known
    to exist in portions of San Diego Bay. Data from several environmental contaminant
    studies in the San Diego Bay during 1991-1992 were included in this Level III Survey.
    Sediments, aquatic plants, marine invertebrates, fishes, birds and bird eggs received
    chemical analysis. Information from the sediment samples was considered most useful
    in terms of determining if a particular area was directly contaminated. Data from
    biota samples was evaluated to determine if a more widespread contamination problem
    may exist, but would not necessarily indicate the area under consideration for acquisition
    was the contamination source. Sediments at three sites contained metals exceeding
    certain guidelines for the protection of aquatic organisms, but none were considered
    high enough to require clean-up, nor should they prohibit the parcel's acquisition.
    Those locations were Site N2 (copper, nickel and zinc), Site O (copper) and Site
    G (lead and nickel). However, N1 (a site very near N2) did not have similarly elevated
    levels of either copper, nickel or zinc. Therefore, the distribution of metal contaminants
    in south San Diego Bay sediments is apparently not homogeneous. PCB's were not detected
    in sediment samples, but were detected in biota samples at levels below hazard thresholds.
    Aliphatic hydrocarbons, PAHs, organotins and most organochlorine (OC) pesticides
    were largely nondetectable in sediments and food-chain biota, or were at levels
    below most hazard thresholds. However, the eggs of all bird species had elevated
    concentrations of DDT-related compounds which is likely from the DDE contamination
    previously documented in coastal southern California. Based upon these results,
    metals in sediments were most elevated at Sites N2, O, and G, but were not at levels
    that would require clean-up or prohibit acquisition. PCB's, aliphatics, PAHs, organotins
    and most OC pesticides were not considered to be problems in the sediments sampled.
    Biota samples contained a variety of contaminants, but those would be from exposures
    occurring throughout the bay, and not necessarily related to the specific areas
    under consideration for the south San Diego Bay Refuge. No site specific contamination
    issues were identified in this survey that would require remedial action nor any
    that should prohibit acquisition of the areas under consideration for the South
    San Diego Bay National Wildlife Refuge (NWR).",nt"license_title": "License
