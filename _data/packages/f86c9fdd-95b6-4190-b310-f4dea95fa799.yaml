    located in the Southern High Plains in Randall County, Texas. The lake from which
    the Refuge received its name has not contained water since the 1980s. In 1987, a
    Phase I contaminants investigation of the Refuge was conducted by the U.S. Fish
    and Wildlife Service, Arlington, Texas, Field Office. The results of this investigation
    indicated that elevated concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus compounds),
    salts, copper, strontium, and zinc were found in and downstream of cattle feedlot
    waste retention lagoons; Tierra Blanca Creek, the major lotic contributor of the
    Refuge, had degraded water quality, primarily attributed to run-off and discharges
    from cattle feedlots; and that nutrient concentrations retained in soils in the
    dry reservoir bed in Buffalo Lake National Wildlife Refuge were elevated to the
    extent that inundation could create unacceptably high nutrient concentrations in
    the surface water. Consequentially, in 1993, a Phase II contaminants study was initiated
    at the Refuge by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to evaluate the extent of contamination
    in stormwater run-off entering the Refuge via Tierra Blanca Creek; to determine
    the extent of contamination in soils and vegetation within the Refuge; to evaluate
    the ability of crops grown in the Refuge to reduce soil contaminant concentrations;
    and to monitor contaminant levels in soils, surface water, and vegetation of moist
    soil management units constructed in the southern portion of the Refuge. To accomplish
    these objectives, surface water samples, representing a stormwater surge, were collected
    in Tierra Blanca Creek, upstream of the Refuge, analyzed for nutrient and total
    metal content, and compared with water data from the Phase I study and criteria
    values protective of aquatic life. Surface water, groundwater, soil, and biological
    samples were collected within the boundaries of the Refuge and analyzed for total
    metal and nutrient content. Data from these water analyses were compared with criteria
    and other screening values protective of aquatic life, while data obtained from
    the soils component of this study were compared with U.S. median background levels.
    The soil data were also statistically compared with data from the Phase I study
    to determine if contaminant levels had increased or decreased within the Refuge
    between 1987 and 1993. Biological samples consisting of vegetation and terrestrial
    invertebrates were analyzed for total metals. The resulting data from this portion
    of the study were statistically analyzed and compared with criteria protective of
    wildlife to determine the bioavailability of contaminants within the Refuge. In
    1994, sediment and additional surface water, groundwater, soil, and biological samples
    were collected from the Refuge. The water samples were analyzed for dissolved metal
    and nutrient content. Soil and sediment samples were analyzed for total metal and
    nutrient content. Biological samples consisted of vegetation, aquatic macroinvertebrates,
    aquatic vertebrates, and avian specimens which were analyzed for total metals. In
    addition, sediment, soil, and biological samples were analyzed for total polychlorinated
    biphenyls and organochlorine pesticide residues. Water, soils, sediment, and biological
    data resulting from these analyses were compared with criteria and screening values
    protective of wildlife resources to further interpret contaminant levels within
    the Refuge.",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
