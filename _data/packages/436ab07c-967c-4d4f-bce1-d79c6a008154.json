	"notes": "This data set contains the forcing data for Phase 1 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-1). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from 29 Sep 1996 to 31 Dec 2007. The temporal resolution is hourly. The file format is WMO GRIB-1. nnThe chief source of NLDAS-1 forcing is NCEP's Eta model-based Data Assimilation System (EDAS) [Rogers et al., 1995], a continuously cycled North American 4DDA system. It utilizes 3-hourly analysis-forecast cycles to derive atmospheric states by assimilating many types of observations, including station observations of surface pressure and screen-level atmospheric temperature, humidity, and U and V wind components. EDAS 3-hourly fields of the latter five variables plus surface downward shortwave and longwave radiation and total and convective precipitation are provided on a 40-km grid, and then interpolated spatially to the NLDAS grid and temporally to one hour. Last, to account for NLDAS versus EDAS surface-elevation differences, a terrain-height adjustment is applied to the air temperature and surface pressure using a standard lapse rate (6.5 K/km), then to specific humidity (keeping original relative humidity) and downward longwave radiation (for new air temperature, specific humidity). The details of the spatial interpolation, temporal disaggregation, and vertical adjustment are presented by Cosgrove et al. (2003). nnGOES-based solar insolation (Pinker et al., 2003) provides the primary insolation forcing (shorwave down at the surface) for NLDAS-1. GOES insolation is not retrieved for zenith angles below 75 degrees and so is supplemented with EDAS insolation near the day/night terminator. Last from the GOES-based product suite, Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) and surface brightness temperature fields are included in the NLDAS-1 forcing files. nnNLDAS-1 precipitation forcing over CONUS is anchored to NCEP's 1/4th degree gauge-only daily precipitation analyses of Higgins et al. [2000]. In NLDAS-1, this daily analysis is interpolated to 1/8th degree, then temporally disaggregated to hourly values by applying hourly weights derived from hourly, 4-km, radar-based (WSR-88D) precipitation fields. The latter radar-based fields are used only to derive disaggregation weights and do not change the daily total precipitation. Last, convective precipitation is estimated by multiplying NLDAS-1 total precipitation by the ratio of EDAS convective to EDAS total precipitation. The Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is the final variable in the forcing data set, also interpolated from EDAS. nnThe data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter number. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_FORA_hourly.001.txt) shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition Section (PDS) IDs and units.nnFor more information, please see the README Document at ftp://hydro1.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/s4pa/NLDAS/README.NLDAS1.pdf.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
