	"notes": "Integration of three proven, non-contact, optical metrology techniques with an emerging new polishing approach in a single machine will enable the rapid production of large aspheric mirrors with nanometer-class overall accuracy, excellent smoothness, and nearly arbitrary radius of curvature (concave or convex) and aspheric form.rnrnTwo of the metrology approaches are a multi-point profilometer that we have previously demonstrated to have nanometer-level accuracy for low spatial frequencies; and a curvature-measuring profilometer that we have previously demonstrated to have 0.1-nanometer-level accuracy for mid-spatial frequencies.  In addition, we propose the simple addition of a scatterometry-based measurement head for high spatial frequencies.  The baseline polishing approach is fluid jet polishing, which has been shown to be capable of both fine grinding and polishing. A new understanding of the synergism of these metrology techniques with ductile polishing promises to take in situ metrology and optical fabrication to a major new level.rnrnNASA is continually pushing the frontier in astronomical and earth-observing optical systems.  Many of these systems, whether they operate in the x-ray (at normal incidence), ultraviolet, visible, or infrared, have the meter-class (and beyond) optics that would greatly benefit from this technology.  rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
