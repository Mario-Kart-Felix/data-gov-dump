	"notes": "&lt;p&gt;The following are the objectives of this project:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Demonstration of 1600-element Kinetic Inductance Detector (KID) imaging array operating at 350 micron with near background-limited sensitivity, a critical development step for the Short Wavelength Camera (SWCam) on CCAT;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Demonstration of 400-element KID imaging array operating at 850 micron with near background-limited sensitivity, also a critical development step for CCAT cameras;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) Phase-contrast wavefront sensing at 850 micron with improved sensitivity and accuracy, targeting the eventual measurement of the CCAT telescope surface.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current worldwide state-of-the art for submillimeter imaging detectors is the U.K.&amp;rsquo;s SCUBA2 instrument, which has 5000 Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) detectors each at 450 and 850 micron. TES&amp;rsquo;s work well, but may have reached practical limits for a ground-based project in part due to the high detector cost (&amp;gt; $100/pixel).&amp;nbsp; KIDs, on the other hand, should achieve a detector cost of &amp;lt;$10/pixel in the medium term and are therefore the baseline for CCAT&amp;rsquo;s short-wavelength camera SWCam, which requires 50,000 detectors. KIDs&lt;br /&gt;manufactured at JPL have shown background-limited performance in the lab at 350 micron, and a 400-element first-generation prototype was tested at CSO in April 2013 (see Figure) with promising results. The SWCam detectors operate by absorbing radiation directly in the inductive element of a TiN film and are fabricated by remarkably simple lithography. 350 micron is the key band for CCAT, and the SWCam detector work to date has concentrated on this band.&amp;nbsp; By re-optimizing the detailed design according to the operating background power, KIDs can work at fundamental background-limited sensitivity limits over a wide range of applications. Given that 850 micron is also an important band for CCAT, we propose to test an 850 micron imaging KID array at CSO in FY14.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In FY12 and FY13, JPL and Caltech demonstrated the first (to our knowledge) implementation of phase-contrast (or Zernike) wavefront sensing applied to a submillimeter telescope (see Figure). In this approach, the detector images the power distribution incident on the pupil (primary mirror), and the phase of the field from a point source is modulated in the image plane in order to map the wavefront in the pupil plane. The resolution in the wavefront mapping improves as the number of imaging elements available grows. The testing demonstrated basic operation of the wavefront sensor, with induced ~&amp;pi;/4 wavefront shifts over ~3&#37; of the telescope surface detectable in a few minutes. This testing has been done so far at 850 micron with the (aging) SHARC2 instrument that was not originally designed for operation at that wavelength. One should be able to do much better with an improved detector.&lt;/p&gt;",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
