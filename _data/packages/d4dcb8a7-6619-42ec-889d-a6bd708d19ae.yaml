    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "<p>The Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS)
    is an administrative data system providing descriptive information about the national
    flow of admissions to providers of substance abuse treatment. The TEDS is a continuation
    of the former Client Data System (CDS) that was originally developed by the Alcohol,
    Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services Administration (predecessor to SAMHSA) in
    consultation with representatives of the state substance abuse agencies and appropriate
    national organizations. TEDS is one of the three components of SAMHSA's Behavioral
    Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information
    System (DASIS)). The core of BHSIS is the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment
    Services (I-SATS), formerly known as the National Master Facility Inventory (NMFI).
    The I-SATS is a continuously-updated comprehensive listing of all known substance
    abuse treatment facilities. The third component of BHSIS is the National Survey
    of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS), formerly called the Uniform Facility
    Data Set (UFDS) survey. The N-SSATS is an annual survey of the location, characteristics,
    and utilization of alcoholism and drug abuse treatment facilities. The N-SSATS/UFDS
    is available from the SAMHDA Web site. Together, they provide national- and state-level
    information on the numbers and characteristics of individuals admitted to alcohol
    and drug treatment and describe the facilities that deliver care to those individuals.
    TEDS includes facilities that are licensed or certified by the state substance abuse
    agency to provide substance abuse treatment (or are administratively tracked for
    other reasons), and that are required by the states to provide TEDS client-level
    data. While compromising a significant proportion of all admissions to substance
    abuse treatment, TEDS does not include all such admissions. The scope of admissions
    included in TEDS is affected by differences in state reporting practices, varying
    definitions of treatment admission, availability of public funds, and public funding
    constraints. In 1997, TEDS was estimated to include 83 percent of TEDS-eligible
    admissions and 67 percent of all known admissions. See the full documentation for
    additional information.</p>n<p>The TEDS series was designed to provide annual data
    on the number and characteristics of persons admitted to public and private substance
    abuse treatment programs receiving public funding. TEDS includes both Minimum Data
    Set (MDS) data (required reporting) and Supplemental Data Set (SuDS) data (optional
    reporting), as reported to state substance abuse agencies by the treatment programs.
    Additional variables, such as calculated age and census region, are added to the
    state data. TEDS provides information on service setting, number of prior treatments,
    primary source of referral, employment status, whether methadone was prescribed
    in treatment, presence of psychiatric problems, living arrangements, health insurance,
    substance(s) abused, route of administration, age at first use, pregnancy and veteran
    status, number of days waiting to enter treatment, and demographic variables.</p>n<p>The
    TEDS data collection effort began in 1989 with three-year development grants to
    states. Within each state, treatment providers that receive any state agency funding,
    including the federal Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant
    monies, are expected to provide TEDS data for all clients admitted to treatment,
    regardless of the source of funding for individual clients.</p>n<p>TEDS is sponsored
    by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality at the Substance Abuse
    and Mental Health Services Administration.</p>n",nt"license_title": "Other
