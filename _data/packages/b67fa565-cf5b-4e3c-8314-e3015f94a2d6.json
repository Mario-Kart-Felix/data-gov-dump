	"notes": "Spacecraft and lunar bases generate a variety of wastes containingnwater, including food wastes, feces, and brines.  Disposal of thesenwastes, as well as recovery of water, is necessary.  However,nevaporation of water also evaporates compounds with foul odors, some ofnwhich are much more volatile than water.  Even apart from a waternrecovery system, foul odors sap crew morale, and must be eliminated. NanoScale&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"n                      "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"&gt;n&lt;sup&gt;REG&lt;/sup&gt;n Corporation has developed a formulation of its proprietary sorbents,ntermed OdorKlenz&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;n, that has been shown to effectively remove odorous compounds from airnby destructive adsorption.  NanoScale proposes development of a similarnformulation, built around nanocrystalline metal oxides manufactured bynNanoScale's proprietary procedures, such as NanoActive TiO2, NanoActivenMgO, and NanoActive ZnO, to remove foul odors in a system that cannrecover water from wastes.  The odor control system will function duringnwaste storage, and also during water recovery . In Phase I, NanoScalenwill demonstrate feasibility by developing a formulation of metal oxidesncapable of removing odorous compounds from food and sanitary wastes, andncompatible with a water recovery system.  Specific test compoundsninclude skatole (3-methylindole, found in feces), putrescinen(1,4-diaminobutane, in rotten protein), ammonia (urine), ethanethiol,nhydrogen sulfide (rotten eggs, flatus), butyric acid (rancid butter),nand butyraldehyde.  Gas streams containing these compounds will benpassed through beds of the metal oxide formulation, with concentrationsnmeasured by GC, before and after passing through the bed.  In Phase II,nthe odor control system will be integrated into the specific details ofnspacecraft and envisioned lunar stations.  Then, brassboard hardwarenwill be developed and evaluated. NanoScale, having pioneered thensynthesis and manufacture of nanocrystalline metal oxides forndestructive adsorption of hazardous compounds, is uniquely qualified tonperform the proposed work.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
