  domestic water-supply wells completed in the Quaternary deposits of south-central
  Kansas were collected as part of the High Plains Regional Ground-Water Study conducted
  by the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment Program. The samples
  were analyzed for about 170 water-quality constituents that included physical properties,
  dissolved solids and major ions, nutrients and dissolved organic carbon, trace elements,
  pesticides, volatile organic compounds, and radon. The purpose of this study was
  to provide a broad overview of ground-water quality in a major geologic subunit
  of the High Plains aquifer. Water from five wells (25 percent) exceeded the 500-milligrams-per-liter
  of dissolved solids Secondary Maximum Contaminant Level for drinking water. The
  Secondary Maximum Contaminant Levels of 250 milligrams per liter for chloride and
  sulfate were exceeded in water from one well each. The source of these dissolved
  solids was probably natural processes. Concentrations of most nutrients in water
  from the sampled wells were small, with the exception of nitrate. Water from 15
  percent of the sampled wells had concentrations of nitrate greater than the 10-milligram-per-liter
  Maximum Contaminant Level for drinking water. Water from 80 percent of the sampled
  wells showed nitrate enrichment (concentrations greater than 2.0 milligrams per
  liter), which is more than what might be expected for natural background concentrations.
  This enrichment may be the result of synthetic fertilizer applications, the addition
  of soil amendment (manure) on cropland, or livestock production. Most trace elements
  in water from the sampled wells were detected only in small concentrations, and
  few exceeded respective water-quality standards. Only arsenic was detected in one
  well sample at a concentration (240 micrograms per liter) that exceeded its proposed
  Maximum Contaminant Level (5.0 micrograms per liter). Additionally, one concentration
  of iron and two concentrations of manganese were larger than the Secondary Maximum
  Contaminant Levels of 300 and 50 micrograms per liter, respectively. Some occurrences
  of trace elements may have originated from human-related sources; however, the generally
  small concentrations that were measured probably reflect mostly natural sources
  for these constituents. A total of 47 pesticide compounds from several classes of
  herbicides and insecticides that included triazine, organophosphorus, organochlorine,
  and carbamate compounds and three pesticide degradation products were analyzed in
  ground-water samples during this study. Water from 50 percent of the wells sampled
  had detectable concentrations of one or more of these 47 compounds. The herbicide
  atrazine and its degradation product deethylatrazine were detected most frequently
  (in water from eight and nine wells, respectively); other pesticides detected were
  the insecticides carbofuran (in water from one well) and diazinon (in water from
  one well), and the herbicide metolachlor (in water from two wells). However, all
  concentrations of these compounds were small and substantially less than established
  Maximum Contaminant Levels. The use of pesticides in crop production probably is
  largely responsible for the occurrence of pesticides in the ground-water samples
  collected during this study. Although concentrations of detected pesticides were
  small (relative to established Maximum Contaminant Levels), the synergistic effect
  of these concentrations and long-term exposure to multiple pesticides on human health
  are unknown.  In general, the occurrence and detection of volatile organic compounds
  were infrequent, detectable concentrations were substantially less than established
  Maximum Contaminant Levels, and the areal distribution of volatile organic compounds
  in ground water was extremely limited.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"4d7ad1cd-3641-420b-8116-e4082f49cd44\",\n\t\"extras\":
