	"notes": "The overall objective of this NASA SBIR program is to develop technology enablers for NASA's rotorcraft vision to facilitate rotorcraft operation in all weather environments.  Specifically, NanoSonic will build on its successful completion of Phase I objectives and first generation test article demonstration to optimize, scale up, and qualify high performance, multifunctional, nanostructured, icephobic appliquis with enhanced erosion resistance for rotorblade leading edges.  rnrnReliable all-weather service has specifically been identified as one of the barriers to achieving NASA's rotorcraft vision.  To truly revolutionize air transportation mobility, rotorcraft must be able to operate in similar environments to current fixed wing vehicles ? including environmental conditions in which icing may occur.  NanoSonic's multifunctional appliquis will help to enable NASA's rotorcraft vision by completely preventing ice buildup on rotorblades.  Implementation of NanoSonic's erosion resistant hydrophobic appliquis will facilitate mission critical operations in icing conditions and mitigate concerns of vibration transmission and shudder that are associated with ice buildup.  NanoSonic's appliquis integrate erosion resistant nanocomposites, enhancing rotorcraft operation in high erosion environments.   Maintenance and associated costs are reduced, as a new appliqui can be readily placed on the rotorblade leading edge when the existing appliqui has exhausted its functionality.rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
