	"notes": "We propose to develop a system that enables integrated and adaptive analysis and visualization of satellite network management data.  Integrated analysis and visualization will enable users to see important patterns that span diverse types of satellite network management data, such as the health status of network components, network resource levels, scheduled activities, and resource allocations.  This system will simplify the creation of linked visualizations that are implemented as tightly integrated displays showing time-oriented data, schematics, spatial data, and statistical graphics.  Adaptive capabilities will enable the system to select appropriate analyses and design visualizations automatically in order to answer higher-level user questions and show data patterns of interest.rnrnDuring Phase 1, we will acquire a more detailed understanding of the data analysis and visualization requirements, design representative data visualizations, produce a high-level system design, and develop a software prototype that demonstrates the utility and feasibility of our approach.  The Phase 2 project will produce TRL 6 data visualization software technologies that support greater situation awareness, enabling NASA to diagnose and manage the SCaN integrated network and other NASA space vehicles and ground-based systems more effectively.rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
