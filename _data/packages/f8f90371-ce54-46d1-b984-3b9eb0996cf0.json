SCARGLE**, AND CHRIS CUSANZA, DAVID BARNES, DENNISrnKANYGIN, RUSSELL SARMIENTO, SOWMYA SUBRAMANIAM, TZU-WANG CHUANG***rnrnAbstract. Consider piece-wise constant approximations to a function of several parameters, andrnthe problem of finding the best such approximation from measurements at a set of points in thernparameter space. We find good approximate solutions to this problem in two steps: (1) partitionrnthe parameter space into cells, one for each of the N data points, and (2) collect these cells intornblocks, such that within each block the function is constant to within measurement uncertainty.rnWe describe a branch-and-bound algorithm for finding the optimal partition into connected blocks,rnas well as an O(N2) dynamic programming algorithm that finds the exact global optimum over thisrnexponentially large search space, in a data space of any dimension. This second solution relaxesrnthe connectivity constraint, and requires additivity and convexity conditions on the block fitnessrnfunction, but in practice none of these items cause problems. From the wide variety of intelligentrndata understanding applications (including cluster analysis, classification, and anomaly detection)rnwe demonstrate two: partitioning of the State of California (2D) and the Universe (3D).",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
