    for the Lake Champlain Basin. The goal in creating this layer was to generate an
    "improved" version of NLCD 2001 using ancillayr GIS data and Landsat satellite
    imagery. The Lake Champlain Basin Program (LCBP) is a joint federal-state initiative
    that helps to monitor and protect Lake Champlain and its contributing watersheds.
    One area of particular concern is nutrient loading to the Lake, particularly phosphorus
    (P), from terrestrial and non-lake sources. In order to quantify how much P is entering
    the lake, it is crucial to have an accurate representation of land use for the Basin.
    This layer represents an updated digital land use - land cover (LULC) map for the
    entire Lake Champlain Basin, termed LCB 2001. This updated LULC layer was generated
    by using an expert system that integrated the 2001 National Land Cover Database
    (NLCD) with ancillary GIS datasets and circa 2001 Landsat satellite imagery. A primary
    focus of this expert system was to improve the mapping accuracy of the agriculture
    LULC class by reducing the confusion with urban open space. An accuracy assessment
    was carried out by comparing the classification to temporally comparable high resolution
    imagery. The overall accuracy of LCB 2001 was 88%. The user's accuracy for the urban
    and agricultural classes, those considered to be the greatest sources of phosphorous,
    was 84% and 89% respectively. LCB 2001 was produced largely by improving NLCD 2001
    using ancillary data. The process of generating LCB 2001 was comprised of three
    phases: 1) overlay of roads, 2) expert system classification, and 3) assessment
    and manual correction. Phase 1 was carried out using the aggregate 8-class version
    of NLCD 2001. The corrected road vector lines were converted to a raster layer with
    a cell size and alignment matching that of NLCD 2001. The road pixels were incorporated
    into the NLCD 2001 layer using standard raster overlay procedures in which any pixel
    in NLCD 2001 that corresponded with a road pixel was reassigned to the urban category.
    The expert system was employed largely to deal with the accuracy issues surrounding
    agriculture and urban open land. Edge effects and registration differences between
    NLCD 2001 and the improved CLU layer made simply overlaying the two an unacceptable
    solution. To overcome this limitation the expert system was developed and deployed
    using Definiens Professional software (Definiens AG, Munich, Germany). The expert
    system took advantage of Definiens Professional's ability to "segment" object
    polygons from image and thematic raster layers. Image object polygons are groups
    of pixels with similar spectral and spatial characteristics. Image object polygons
    allow for the inclusion of rules based on complex topological relationships. Image
    object polygons for this project were derived from both the spring and fall circa
    2001 Landsat satellite scenes, but were constrained to the boundaries of the Improved
    CLU layer and NLCD 2001. Thus, each object polygon consisted of groups of pixels
    that were spectrally and spatially similar and share the same attributes with respect
    to the Improved CLU layer and the NLCD 2001 layer. The expert system first evaluated
    whether or not the object fell into the confirmed agriculture or urban-open categories
    based on the Improved CLU layer. If either of these tests proved true then the object
    was assigned to the corresponding class. If the test failed then the alternate scenarios
    were evaluated. For objects originally classified as agriculture in NLCD 2001 the
    object was assigned to the output agriculture class only if the object bordered
    an object already classified as agriculture (to deal with edge effects and layer
    alignment issues) or if the object was also in the improved CLU layer's possible
    agriculture category. This rule ran in an iterative loop to compensate for the fact
    that once objects were classified as agriculture they would influence other border
    objects. The rule only stopped executing once all objects were finished changing
    their class assignment. If the object was not assigned to the output agriculture
    class at this stage (those classified as agriculture in NLCD 2001, but not in LCB
    2001) it was evaluated using a series of spectral and spatial rules to assign it
    to the output brush or urban-open classes. This set of spectral and spatial rules
    applied a fuzzy class assignment. The object was considered to be more likely to
    be brush the darker it was and the further it was from urban areas. The object was
    considered more likely to be urban if it was near urban areas and brighter. For
    all other classes the objects adopted the NLCD 2001 class. Following the running
    of the expert system the output classification was manually compared to the Landsat
    imagery and any objects that appeared to be misclassified were reassigned. As the
    goal of the project was to maintain as much consistency with NLCD 2001 as possible
    the layer was maintained in its original coordinate system - USA Albers Equal Area
