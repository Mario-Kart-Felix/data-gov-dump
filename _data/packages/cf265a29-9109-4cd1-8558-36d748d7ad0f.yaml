  city is a unit of local government for which the functions of an incorporated place

  results in both the primary incorporated place and the county or MCD continuing
  to exist as legal entities, even though the county or MCD performsn          few
  or no governmental functions and has few or no elected officials.  Where this occurs,
  and where one or more other incorporated places in the county or MCDn          continue
  to function as separate governments, even though they have been included in the
  consolidated government, the primary incorporated place is referredn          to
