	"notes": "SSCI is proposing to develop a set of topology control algorithms for anformation flying spacecraft that can be used to design and evaluatencandidate formation architectures. Properties of these topology controlnalgorithms include: (a) Preserving the connectivity of the underlyingnstate-dependent sensing graph during reconfiguration and re-targeting ofnthe formation; (b) Achieving a balanced interplay between performancenand robustness to communication delays; and (c) Using only localninformation to make local decisions that collectively guarantee thenglobal properties such as the network connectivity. Phase I effort willndeliver a preliminary software analysis tool to help the NASA TPFI teamnevaluate these trade-offs for candidate TPFI architectures. In order tonachieve these objectives we plan to carry out the following tasks: (i)nDevelop algorithms to maximize the connectivity under limited FOVnconstraints. (ii) Analyze the trade-off between network connectivity andnrobustness to communication delays. (iii) Design algorithms to maintainnconnectivity during a pre-specified reconfiguration with energy optimalntrajectories. (iv) Demonstrate the application of the developed methodsnto TPF-I baseline mission. In Phase II the goal is to deliver to NASA ancomplete set of algorithms and software tools to perform distributedncommunication design for TPF-I as well as other formation flyingnmissions that may involve a larger number of spacecraft. Thesenalgorithms and software will be tested on high fidelity formation flyingntestbeds at JPL such as FAST or FCT.Professor Mehran Mesabhi ofnUniversity of Washington will provide technical support under the project.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
