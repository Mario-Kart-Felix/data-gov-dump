    1840-1995. Notes on the data: File includes columns for Year AD (bimonthly resolution
    = dec/jan, feb/mar) and coral d18O. The coral used in this study grew (and still
    does grow) at Maiana Atoll, Republic of Kiribati (1N, 173E). The colony lies at
    a depth of ~6m (low tide) and is about 4m in height. Annual growth rate is roughly
    11mm/yr. Methods: Sampling and isotopic analysis: Cores (8.5 cm diameter) drilled
    from living coral colonies were slabbed and X-rayed to identify annual density bands
    and optimal sampling transects. Samples were drilled along the growth axis continuously
    at 1mm resolution. Stable isotopic analysis (d18O and d13C) of powdered samples
    was performed on a Micromass Optima with Isocarb automated preparation system at
    the University of Colorado's Institute for Arctic and Alpine Research. Analytical
    precision is =&oacute;&oacute;0.08 d18O and =&oacute;&oacute;0.05 d13C. The Maiana
    record is continuous except for a gap from 1901-1905, which we bridged through straight
    forward comparison and splicing of data from a coral record from nearby Tarawa Atoll.
    Age model: Seasonally varying d13C values and ephemeral annual density bands provide
    the basis for annual age assignment. Ages were adjusted subseasonally by comparison
    to major El Ni&oacute;&oacute;o and La Ni&oacute;&oacute;a anomalies in a regional
    rainfall index (available at http://tao.atmos.washington.edu/datasets/eqpacislandrainindex/);
    this procedure allows us to align major peaks and troughs that occur within the
    same calendar year with adjustments that are generally less than 3 months. Because
    corals grow at variable rates throughout the year, these small chronological adjustments
    are reasonable and customary (and do not affect estimates of multi-year variability).
    Near the base of the core, an age adjustment of 1 year was needed, suggesting an
    age uncertainty on the full record of &oacute;&oacute;1 year. The Maiana coral grew
    at a rate of 7-12 mm per year; we interpolated records to a common time step of
    bimonthly resolution for further analysis. Replication: The record from core MAI95-2-3
    is well replicated by additional records of 65-70 years from Maiana and Aranuka,
    ~75 km southeast of Maiana, (JEC, FEU, and JTO, manuscript in preparation) and by
    a published 97-year record from Tarawa Atoll, ~30 km north of Maiana. Correlation
    coefficients among coral and instrumental data over the common period 1950-89 are
    consistently high (Maiana_correlations.txt), adding confidence to single-core reconstruction
    of regional variability in western Kiribati. We focus on the MAI95-2-3 record for
    further analysis because it extends the record of ENSO into pre-instrumental periods
    and avoids nonstationarity that may be introduced through inclusion of records that
    differ in length. The 4-coral average correlates slightly better with instrumental
    data than most individual coral records, but only Mai 2-3 extends the instrumental
    record of ENSO. Linear correlation coefficients demonstrate a strong agreement between
    the Maiana record and ENSO variability (Table 1), and decadalaverages of the Maiana
    record correlate significantly over the past century (>95% confidence) with those
    from the Tarawa coral record and regional rainfall indices, substantiating the reality
    of these more subtle low-frequency signals (JEC, FEU, and JTO, manuscript in preparation).",nt"owner_org":
