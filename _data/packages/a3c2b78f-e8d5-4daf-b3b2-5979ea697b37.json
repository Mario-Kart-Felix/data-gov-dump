The  goal is to integrate the now provennpartially-averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS) method for unsteady flownsimulations with the most advanced closure models for compressibility,nhigh-enthalpy (flow - thermodynamics coupling) and  non-equilibriumn(flow - chemistry coupling) effects. The PANS model has been establishednas a reliable model for computing separation in low and high speednregimes in two recently conclude NASA NRA projects -- 1. RANS and PANSnmodeling of hypersonic turbulent mixing environment;  2. Modeling ofnstrongly separated flows with the PANS bridging method. The currentnproposal is to incorporate further hypersonic effect closures into PANS.nPhysics-based closure models for flow-thermochemistry interactions havenbeen under development in Girimaji's group at Texas A&amp;amp;M under AFOSRnMURI funding -- Transition and Turbulence modeling innnon-thermochemical-equilibrium hypersonic flows. Important closure modelnbuilding blocks for hypersonic processes are now available from thenabove fundamental research efforts. The combination of PANS and thesenadvanced high-speed models will lead to a unique capability forncomputing hypersonic flow separation with ablation, chemistry andncompressibility effects. For Phase I, we propose a logical sequence ofnverification-validation computations to demonstrate the potential of thenvarious individual closures in separated high-speed high-enthalpy flows.nWhile in-house codes are available for the proposed development, we willnalso consider using any of the NASA codes: USM3D, OVERFLOW, VULCAN ornany of the other codes suggested by the grantor. Subsequent work (PhasenII) will focus on the assembly of the individual components andndevelopment of an unique high-fidelity computational capability fornhypersonic vehicle design, testing and development.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
