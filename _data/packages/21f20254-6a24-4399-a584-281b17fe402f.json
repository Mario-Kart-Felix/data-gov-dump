	"notes": "&lt;p&gt;A hyperspectral visible radiometer instrument system has been developed for use on UAS platforms.&amp;nbsp; It has been successfully flown on three previous UAS field campaigns, and recently integrated for flight on board MIZOPEX a fourth.&amp;nbsp; In all of these experiments, the radiometer was configured in a fixed-look scan angle mode that allowed for observing along a single fixed track, and the science data were recorded internally on board the UAS and only made available upon the successful return of the UAS and its payload.&amp;nbsp; The focus of this project is to expand upon the present UAS capability for observing hyperspectral reflectance spectra.&amp;nbsp; By integrating a scanning subsystem and a remote telemetry capability, we will enable science investigator(s) to modify the scanning configuration in order to optimize the science data collection in a specific region in the cross-track domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hyperspectral radiometer instrumentation will be integrated into a scanning subsystem in order to allow the radiometer to scan across a range of angles as the UAV progresses along in its survey. &amp;nbsp;The configuration will consist of a series of lower spectral resolution radiometers that will be set to cross-track scan angles, a higher spectral resolution radiometer with a cosine collector set to zenith for measuring the downward radiance spectra, and a second higher resolution radiometer mounted to a servo motor for scanning along a cross-track scan angle that can either be preset or controlled remotely. &amp;nbsp;Real time spectral observations will be downscaled to send the spectra to a downlink computer in near real time.&amp;nbsp; These observations would then be available for re-tasking the scanning component of the radiometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to collect reflectance spectra of the ocean surface in real time can help scientists optimize their data collection strategies.&amp;nbsp; Optimization of data collection has become a growing area of research, especially for scienctists who are faced with collecting science data in a regions that have small space and time scales of variability.&amp;nbsp; This problem is also one of concern for UAS-enabled science instruments that would prefer to set their observational focus as a function of the observed spatial variability, allowing more observations to be collected along features of interest and less within areas that show little variability.&amp;nbsp; Such observing strategies lend well to 2D spatial mapping algorithms such as optimal interpolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present radiometer instruments and software is easily portable to a system configured with multiple radiometers.&amp;nbsp; The two major technical aspects of this project will be in regard to the control of the pointing system and with the real time data telemetry link.&lt;/p&gt;",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
