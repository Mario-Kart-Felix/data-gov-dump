    location where sworn officers of a law enforcement agency are regularly based or
    stationed. Law Enforcement agencies "are publicly funded and employ at least one
    full-time or part-time sworn officer with general arrest powers". This is the definition
    used by the US Department of Justice - Bureau of Justice Statistics (DOJ-BJS) for
    their Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey. Although
    LEMAS only includes non Federal Agencies, this dataset includes locations for Federal,
    state, local, and special jurisdiction law enforcement agencies. Law Enforcement
    agencies include, but are not limited to, municipal police, county sheriffs, state
    police, school police, park police, railroad police, federal law enforcement agencies,
    departments within non law enforcement federal agencies charged with law enforcement
    (e.g. US Postal Inspectors), and cross jurisdictional authorities (e.g. Port Authority
    Police). Although TGS' intention is to only include locations associated with agencies
    that meet the above definition, TGS has discovered a few locations that are associated
    with agencies that are not publicly funded. TGS is deleting these locations as we
    become aware of them, but some probably still exist in this dataset. Generally the
    requirements and training for becoming a sworn law enforcement officer are set by
    each state. Law Enforcement agencies themselves are not chartered or licensed by
    their state. County, city and other government authorities within each state are
    generally empowered by their state law to setup or disband Law Enforcement agencies.
    Never the less, the agencies have visibility to state level authorities because
    generally sworn Law Enforcement officers must report to the state the agency they
    are employed by. TGS did not verify any state attributes, only the name, physical
    street address, city, state, five digit zip code, phone number and location were
    verified through phone contact. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset
    have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search
    results. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish
    tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate
    use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this
    dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. Based upon this attribute the
