	"notes": "&lt;p&gt;The proposed instrument, which uses experimental techniques adapted from high energy physics, is a passive receiver of a naturally occurring signal generated by interactions of deep penetrating cosmic ray neutrinos. It could measure ice thickness directly,and at a significant savings to spacecraft resources. In addition to getting the global average ice thickness this instrument can beconfigured to make low resolution global maps of the ice shell. Such maps would be invaluable for understanding planetary features and finding the best places for future landers to explore. The approach and our findings so far are described in our paper in Icarus (Miller, et al., 2012, Icarus 220, 877&amp;ndash;888). The basic idea is to use radio receiver technology to detect cosmic ray neutrinos passing through the ice sheet and generating Cerenkov radio pulses (the Askaryan effect). The rate and directional distribution of the detected neutrino interactions will depend upon the thickness of the observed ice sheet. This technology has previously been demonstrated on Antarctic balloon flights by the ANITA neutrino project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this work we will extend the scope of our original investigation and explore in greater detail the possibility of making low resolution global maps of the ice shells - instead of simply getting a global average ice thickness. In addition, we will improve the fidelity of our initial simulation used to analyze the concept in several important areas in order to more precisely determine the final measurement capabilities of the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
