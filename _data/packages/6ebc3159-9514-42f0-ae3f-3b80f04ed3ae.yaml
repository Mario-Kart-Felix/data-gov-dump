    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;The proposed activity involves
    the development of multilayer structures for the enhancement of optical instrumentation
    for the field of X-ray, EUV, and neutron optics applications.&amp;nbsp; One of the
    final outcomes would be the marriage of multilayer technology with MSFC&amp;rsquo;s
    replication process and the developing differential deposition process to produce
    full shell, high-angular resolution- multilayer mirrors.&amp;nbsp; To this aim we
    are seeking funding for:&amp;nbsp; the design, acquisition, and assembly of a magnetron
    sputter deposition system for the development of novel multilayer thin film X-ray
    optics.&amp;nbsp; The system would be designed in such a way as to provide the flexibility
    in deposition geometry and motion control needed for the development of multilayer
    coatings on various substrates including deposition directly on mandrels needed
    to produce full shell replicated optics which is a key component for enhancing the
    performance of X-ray space telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multilayer X-ray mirrors
    are nanometer scale structures consisting of alternating layers of high and low
    refractive index materials.&amp;nbsp; Multilayer structures are advantageous due
    to the large selection of materials whose unique optical and mechanical properties
    can be exploited for the design and optimization of reflectivity over a much broader
    range of photon energies than single layer total reflection optics which is currently
    utilized by Chandra, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The large number of layers and
    the means to precisely control their thickness combined with advances in optimization
    algorithms has recently extended their application to broadband-type X-ray optics.
    These so called aperiodic or depth graded multilayers can be tailored to elicit
    a specific spectral reflectivity response over a particular photon energy range
    of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnetron sputtering is a technique for depositing
    thin films (i.e. nanometer scale thickness).&amp;nbsp; This deposition process requires
    a magnetic field behind a target of material from which the films are composed.&amp;nbsp;
    Atoms of a gas, such as argon, will become ionized as a result of the interaction
    with a high density of electrons trapped close to the target surface by the magnetic
    field.&amp;nbsp; Atoms of the target material are ejected due to the collisions
    of the gas ions which have been accelerated due to the Coulomb force between the
    negatively charged target surface and the positively charged gas ions.&amp;nbsp;
    These atoms are ejected by momentum transfer and then effectively evaporated onto
    a smooth substrate thereby forming a film of pure material which can be as thin
    as a few atomic layers thick.&amp;nbsp; A vacuum environment is required to ensure:
    a large mean free path, purity of the sputtered species, and purity of the gas used
    as the source of ions. The large and diverse selection of material compositions
    including compounds, dielectrics, and metals that can be sputtered by this technique
    is a distinct advantage over other methods such as thermal evaporation&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
