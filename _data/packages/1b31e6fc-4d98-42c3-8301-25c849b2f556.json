	"notes": " \n        The emphasis of this performance evaluation is primarily on the economic and financial assessment of one specific activity of the Fruit Tree Productivity Project, namely the \u201cExtension of fruit tree plantations. The evaluation is commissioned by APP\/ MCC to take the outcome of the previous exercises as the starting point; revise the assumption made therein in light of actual situation in terms of outputs achieved and likely outcomes to be realized, and fine-tune the working hypothesis with respect to the key variables such as the yields and production costs.\n\nThe approach of the present exercise has focused on three aspects that are of crucial importance to the economic and financial impact assessment of the project.  (i) The role and the significance of cereal crops in the livelihood of the smallholders in the project area, (2) the motivation of the stallholder to switch from traditional agricultural practices (TIP) being used in fruit tree husbandry to improved agricultural practices (IAP); and (3) the willingness of the stallholders to internalize wholly or partly the cost associated with the protection of the natural resource base.\n\nThe impact of the olive expansion activity is potentially positive on farmers' income, on food security, and on reducing poverty: \n\nThe Base constant-price ERR was estimated at 12.2% suggesting favorable outcomes on beneficiaries as a result of the intervention. While the ERR depends on a number of variables associated with fruit production, namely yields of fruit tree, oil content, prices and agricultural practices used by participating farmers, it also depends on the whether intercropping of cereal crops will be practiced during the life of the project and on their yields and prices. Intercropping will remain a critical factor in the economic viability of this project, especially if fruit tree yields are lower and\/or production costs are higher than their corresponding basic values. This ERR corresponds to an average intercropping rate of 78%. Without intercropping the project economic viability is questionable.\n\nThe ERR was estimated based on the assumption that the contractually required 100% planting success rate is achieved. If this if success rate is reduced by 20% and 30% the corresponding ERR is estimated at 11% and 10% respectively. \n\nDue lack of reliable information regarding the status of the Soil and Water Conservation works,  no attempt was made to assess the environmental benefits of these works and their impact on ERR. One important observation is that the ERR would be if the investment cost is reduced by a percentage equivalent to the weight of the in total investment cost.  \n\n-At full development and thanks to newly established fruit trees along with intercropping, the food security of the participating households is likely to be enhanced.\n-While the available information is not sufficient to confirm that the project interventions have reached the real poor in the project area, one thing is certain is that 80% of the farmers in the selected villages obtained 83% of the areas planted. The average area planted by each beneficiary is about 1.56Ha. The Provinces that have been targeted by the project have high poverty levels.\n-During its implementation over 2009-2013, the planting activity generated the equivalent of 5.6 million man-days of employment opportunities. Tree planting activities under the Project are labor intensive and hence expected to generate additional seasonal, but sustained, employment opportunities directly associated with the value chain of fruit trees such as pruning, treatment and harvesting, transportation services and transformation, in addition to casual labor. It is estimated that at full development, an average of 4,700 to 5,000 recurrent seasonal employment opportunities would be created annually.\n      ",
