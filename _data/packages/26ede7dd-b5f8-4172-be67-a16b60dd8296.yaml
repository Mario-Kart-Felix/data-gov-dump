    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    that represent physical phenomenon is ubiquitous in the science and engineering
    communities. There are two main approaches that can be taken to extract relevant
    features from these high-dimensional data streams. The first set of approaches relies
    on extracting features using a physics-based paradigm where the underlying physical
    mechanism that generates the spectra is used to infer the most important features
    in the data stream. We focus on a complementary methodology that uses a data-driven
    technique that is informed by the underlying physics but also has thernability to
    adapt to unmodeled system attributes and dynamics. We discuss the following four
    algorithms: Spectral Decomposition Algorithm (SDA), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
    (NMF), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
    and compare their performance on a spectral emulator which we use to generate artificial
    data with known statistical properties. This spectral emulator mimics the real-world
    phenomena arising from the plume of the space shuttle main engine and can be used
    to validate the results that arise from various spectral decomposition algorithms
    and is very useful for situations where real-world systems have very low probabilities
    of fault or failure. Our results indicate that methods like SDA and NMF provide
    a straightforward way of incorporating prior physical knowledge while NMF with a
    tuning mechanism can give superior performance on some tests. We demonstrate thesernalgorithms
    to detect potential system-health issues on data from a spectral emulator with tunable
    health parameters.",nt"owner_org": "d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed",nt"extras":
