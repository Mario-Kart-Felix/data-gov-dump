A unique identifier called StateID is common in all of these databases, and it may be used to join the databases together, and also back to the original data (the Raw file). nnThese data have been processed and interpreted as part of the Thermal Quality Analysis task.  Processing details, and file and field name definitions for these databases may be found  8_GPFA-AB_ThermalModelMethods.pdf (Smith and Horowitz, 2015), which was provided within the final report for this project. nnThe only difference between the database entitled AASG_Thermed.xlsx and AASG_Thermed_AllThicksAndConds.xlsx is that the latter has columns for the formation thicknesses (Layer) and thermal conductivities (Cond) corresponding to each thickness for each well. There are also columns for the temperature at 10 m (T0) to 5000 m (T499) in 10 m increments.n nNote that some records in AASG_Thermed.xlsx and AASG_Thermed_AllThicksAndConds.xlsx have -9999 in the Depth50C, Depth80C, and Depth100C. This is because the maximum depth for these fields was 20000 m, and for these records one would have to go deeper than 20000 m to reach 50 u00b0C, 80 u00b0C, or 100 u00b0C. nThe calculation of the geotherm and surface heat flow for these wells was done using the code repository developed by Smith, Horowitz, and Whealton (2015) and described in 8_GPFA-AB_ThermalModelMethods.pdf (Smith and Horowitz, 2015).n ",

The Rome Trough (e.g. Repetski et al. [2008]) defines the boundary between the Allegheny Plateau Correction section and the Zero Correction section. The Zero Correction section is for everywhere southeast of the Rome Trough in Pennsylvania, and is also used for Maryland because the well cluster in Maryland appears to be consistent with the well cluster across the border in Pennsylvania. The Allegheny Plateau is used for all wells located northwest of the Rome Trough. West Virginia, Virginia, and Kentucky all have a separate correction section defined based on wells in West Virginia. Further details about the use of BHT correction sections are provided in the file entitled 2_GPFA-AB_BHTCorrections.pdf (Whealton, Stedinger, and Horowitz, 2015), contained within the project final report.

This file contains the binary grid (raster) for Western Pennsylvania.nnThe 14 files .zip files contain the data used and the products of the worm-based delineation of interpolation boundaries using ArcGIS. The gravity and pseudogravity (magnetic) worms are contained in two SQLite databases that are part of a separate data submission, u201cRisk of Seismicity in Low-Temperature Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis for the Appalachian Basin (GPFA-AB)u201d.  These databases were loaded into QGIS and queried for only those worm levels (worm_level) that were greater than 18, which is essentially deeper than 18 km. These were converted into a shapefile for display purposes (GravWorms_18+.shp and MagWorms_18+.shp). Digitization of the interpolation boundaries was done in ArcGIS using the Editor toolbar, and was based primarily on the gravity worms. Only one region, SWPA, required information from the magnetic worms because of a strong magnetic contrast that defines this section. Names of the boundaries were made according to geographic location within the Appalachian Basin. For example, the so-called Valley and Ridge boundary roughly follows the Valley and Ridge physiographic province. Further details, including full names of the sections, are provided within the file called 9_GPFA-AB_InterpolationThermalFieldEstimation.pdf (within the project final report). Note that section MT and section WWV are used interchangeably to refer to the same section.nnSection names used in the file name schema:  nCNY = Central New York; nCT = Chautauqua County, New York; nCWV = Central West Virginia; nENY = Eastern New York; nENYPA = Eastern New York and Eastern Pennsylvania; nMT = Western West Virginia; nNWPANDY = Northwestern Pennsylvania and Northwestern New York; nSWPA = Southwestern Pennsylvania; nVR = Valley and Ridge; nWPA = Western Pennsylvaniau2003n",

	"notes": "This collection of files are part of a larger dataset uploaded in support of Low Temperature Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis for the Appalachian Basin (GPFA-AB, DOE Project DE-EE0006726). Phase 1 of the GPFA-AB project identified potential Geothermal Play Fairways within the Appalachian basin of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and New York.  This was accomplished through analysis of 4 key criteria or u2018risksu2019: thermal quality, natural reservoir productivity, risk of seismicity, and heat utilization.  Each of these analyses represent a distinct project task, with the fifth task encompassing combination of the 4 risks factors.  Supporting data for all five tasks has been uploaded into the Geothermal Data Repository node of the National Geothermal Data System (NGDS). nnThis submission comprises the data for Thermal Quality Analysis (project task 1) and includes all of the necessary shapefiles, rasters, datasets, code, and references to code repositories that were used to create the thermal resource and risk factor maps as part of the GPFA-AB project. The identified Geothermal Play Fairways are also provided with the larger dataset. Figures (.png) are provided as examples of the shapefiles and rasters. The regional standardized 1 square km grid used in the project is also provided as points (cell centers), polygons, and as a raster. Two ArcGIS toolboxes are available: 1) RegionalGridModels.tbx for creating resource and risk factor maps on the standardized grid, and 2) ThermalRiskFactorModels.tbx for use in making the thermal resource maps and cross sections. These toolboxes contain u201citem descriptionu201d documentation for each model within the toolbox, and for the toolbox itself. This submission also contains three R scripts: 1) AddNewSeisFields.R to add seismic risk data to attribute tables of seismic risk, 2) StratifiedKrigingInterpolation.R for the interpolations used in the thermal resource analysis, and 3) LeaveOneOutCrossValidation.R for the cross validations used in the thermal interpolations.nnSome file descriptions make reference to various 'memos'.  These are contained within the final report submitted October 16, 2015.   nnEach zipped file in the submission contains an 'about' document describing the full Thermal Quality Analysis content available, along with key sources, authors, citation, use guidelines, and assumptions, with the specific file(s) contained within the .zip file  highlighted.",
