    Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, from 21 January - 14 February 2010, marine invertebrate quantitative
    assessments were conducted, as part of Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA), during
    the Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruise HI1001 in the Pacific Remote
    Island Areas. Such cruises are conducted at biennial intervals by the Coral Reef
    Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC).
    At specific reef sites, marine invertebrate zoologists along with coral and algal
    biologists entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~100 m2) and high degree
    of taxonomic resolution benthic REA survey for coral, algae, and key invertebrate
    species. Invertebrate surveys were focused on quantifying key non-coral invertebrate
    species common to the reef habitats, and were conducted using a belt-transect survey
    method. In belt-transect surveys, quantitative counts of key invertebrates were
    recorded along two consecutively-placed 25m long and 2m wide belt transects (total
    area = 100 m2). For any species that cannot be identified in the field, a photograph
    and a representative specimen, if possible, is collected for later identification.
    Based on data from previous REA surveys, a group of target invertebrate species
    was chosen for quantitative counts at 13 REA sites at Tutila Island in the Pacific
    Remote Island Areas. The species in the list were chosen because they have been
    shown to be common components of the reef habitats and they are species that are
    generally visible (i.e.; non-cryptic) and easily enumerated during the course of
    a single 50-60 minute SCUBA survey.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
