    meter cell size representing the bathymetry of a sharply sloping swath of the St.
    John Shelf, a selected portion of seafloor south of St. John, USVI, derived from
    data collected from 3/28/2011 to 4/14/2011. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch,
    in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private
    sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data south of St. Thomas and St.
    John, USVI, from 3/28/11 to 4/14/2011. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg
    Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) for water depths greater than 75 meters.
    It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors
    applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water
    (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone
    20 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE
    surface based on CUBE. A BAG file was exported from the BASE surface, and converted
    to a GeoTIFF in ESRI ArcMap 10.The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and
    2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should
    individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs
    and standards.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
