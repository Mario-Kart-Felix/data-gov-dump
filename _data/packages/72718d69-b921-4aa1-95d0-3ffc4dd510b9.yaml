  Minnesota County Biological Survey (MCBS). It includes polygons representing the
  highest quality native plant communities remaining in surveyed counties. These native
  plant communities are important areas for conservation. Native plant communities
  (sometimes also referred to as \"natural communities\") are groups of native plants
  that interact with each other and their surrounding environment in ways not greatly
  altered by modern human activity or by introduced plant or animal species. These
  groups of native species form recognizable units, such as an oak forest, a prairie,
  or a marsh, that tend to repeat across the landscape and over time. Native plant
  communities are generally classified and described by considering vegetation, hydrology,
  land forms, soils, and natural disturbance regimes. The native plant community types
  and subtypes in this data layer are classified primarily by vegetation and major
  habitat features. Classification and inventory of native plant communities is an
  ongoing effort of the Natural Heritage and Nongame Research Program and the Minnesota
  County Biological Survey. The Minnesota County Biological Survey located higher
  quality native plant communities using aerial photo interpretation followed by field
  survey of selected sites. Areas that were not mapped as native plant community polygons
  primarily represent: 1) land where modern human activities such as farming, overgrazing,
  wetland drainage, recent logging and residential and commercial development have
  destroyed or greatly altered the natural vegetation; and 2) native plant community
  polygons that were below minimal size criteria. Note: some areas that were not mapped
  are important for conservation. They may include habitat for native plants and animals,
  corridors for animal movement, buffers surrounding high quality natural areas and
  open space, and target areas for restoration.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\":
