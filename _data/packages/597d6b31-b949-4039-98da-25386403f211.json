	"notes": "The five files included in this U.S. Geological Survey data release are data from a set of sediment cores acquired from the continental slope, north of Monterey Canyon, offshore central California. Vibracores and push cores were collected with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Instituteu2019s (MBARIu2019s) remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Doc Ricketts in 2014 (cruise ID 2014-615-FA; http://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/fan_info.php?fan=2014-615-FA). One spreadsheet (NorthernFlankMontereyCanyonCores_Info.xlsx) contains core name, location, and length. One spreadsheet (NorthernFlankMontereyCanyonCores_MSCLdata.xlsx) contains Multi-Sensor Core Logger P-wave velocity and gamma-ray density whole-core logs of vibracores. One zipped folder of .bmp files (NorthernFlankMontereyCanyonCores_Photos.zip) contains continuous core photographs of the archive half of each vibracore. One spreadsheet (NorthernFlankMontereyCanyonCores_Radiocarbon.xlsx) contains radiocarbon sample information, results, and calibrated ages. One .pdf file (NorthernFlankMontereyCanyonCores_Figures.pdf) contains combined displays of data for each core, including graphic diagram descriptive logs. This particular metadata file describes the information contained in the file NorthernFlankMontereyCanyonCores_MSCL.xlsx. All vibracores are archived by the U.S. Geological Survey Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center. Other remaining core material, if available, is archived at MBARI.",
