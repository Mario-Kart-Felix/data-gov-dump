  classified as civil townships, but as special district governments. Special district
  governments exist to provide only one or a limited number ofdesignated functions,
  and with sufficient administrative and fiscal autonomy to qualify as separate governments.
  Iowa townships today provide governmental functions that are outside the realm of
  both county and municipal authority. The three main functions of Iowa townships
  are fire protection, cemetery management, and fence maintenance and boundary dispute
  resolution within the township. The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related
  database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic
  information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated
  Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents
  a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line
  File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined
  to cover the entire nation. County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties
  and their equivalent entities for the reporting of Census Bureau data, and they
  include legally minor civil divisions (MCDs) and statistical census county divisions
  (CCDs), and unorganized territories. For the 2010 Census, the legal MCDs are the
  primary governmental and/or administrative divisions of counties in 29 States and
  Puerto Rico; Tennessee changed from having CCDs for Census 2000 to having MCDs for
  the 2010 Census. In MCD States where no MCD exists or is not defined, the Census
  Bureau creates statistical unorganized territories to complete coverage. The entire
  area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by county
  subdivisions. The boundaries of all 2010 Census legal MCDs are as of January 1,
  2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).
  For the 2010 Census, CCDs or their equivalents are delineated in 21 States. The
  boundaries of all 2010 Census statistical CCDs were delineated as part of the Census
  Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).\",\n\t\"license_title\":
