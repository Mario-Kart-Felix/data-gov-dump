    and are generated in areas as disparate as sensor recordings in aerospace systems,
    music and video streams, medical monitoring, and financial systems. Domain experts
    are often interested in searching for interesting multivariate patterns from these
    MTS databases which can contain up to several gigabytes of data. Surprisingly, research
    on MTS search is very limited. Most existing work only supports queries with the
    same length of data, or queries on a fixed set of variables. In this paper, we propose
    an efficient and flexible subsequence search framework for massive MTS databases,
    that, for the first time, enables querying on any subset of variables with arbitrary
    time delays between them. We propose two provably correct algorithms to solve this
    problem u2014 (1) an R-tree Based Search (RBS) which uses Minimum Bounding Rectangles
    (MBR) to organize the subsequences, and (2) a List Based Search (LBS) algorithm
    which uses sorted lists for indexing. We demonstrate the performance of these algorithms
    using two large MTS databases from the aviation domain, each containing several
    millions of observations. Both these tests show that our algorithms have very high
    prune rates (>95%) thus needing actual disk access for only less than 5% of the
    observations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first flexible MTS search
    algorithm capable of subsequence search on any subset of variables. Moreover, MTS
    subsequence search has never been attempted on datasets of the size we have used
    in this paper.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
