    for Porites in the Au'au Channel region. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modeling software
    was used to create this ensemble model, which is an average of 10 model replicates.
    MaxEnt works by analyzing the distribution of environmental variables where species
    are present, so it can find other areas that meet all of the same environmental
    constraints. Georeferenced records containing information about mesophotic coral
    occurrence and environmental predictors describing the seafloor's depth, vertical
    structure, available light, surface temperature, currents and distance from shoreline
    were used to train MaxEnt. Model performance and accuracy were assessed using Receiver
    Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) and a randomly chosen,
    spatially independent data subset. The average test AUC for this predictive ensemble
    model was 0.9, and the overall accuracy of this ensemble predictive model was 73.1%
    (when the habitat suitability threshold = 0.25). The habitat suitability threshold
    of 0.25 represents the sum of the maximum ROC sensitivity and specificity values.
    Extreme care should be taken when selecting a habitat suitability threshold because
    it affects the probability of correctly identifying the presence and absence of
    mesophotic corals. For more information describing how this predictive surface was
    developed and its limitations, please see the following website: https://coastalscience.noaa.gov/projects/detail?key=48",nt"owner_org":
