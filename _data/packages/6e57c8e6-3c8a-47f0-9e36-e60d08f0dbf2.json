	"notes": "In 2001, the USFWS Arlington, Texas Field Office initiated a one-year study on the mainstem of the South Canadian River in the Texas Panhandle to determine the impact of anthropogenic discharges on the aquatic habitat of the federally listed Arkansas River shiner. Surface water, sediment and biological samples were collected at six sites (five in Texas and one in New Mexico) on the mainstem of the south Canadian River during high flow and low flow conditions. Surface water samples were analyzed for total fecal coliforms and nutrient content. Sediment samples were analyzed for total metals and total petroleum hydrocarbons during the high flow phase and total metals, total petroleum hydrocarbons, and organochlorines during the low flow sampling phase. Resulting data from the surface water and sediment analyses were compared with other studies and criteria protective of aquatic wildlife. The biological samples consisted of fish and macroinvertebrates. Data from the fish sampling were used to calculate Indices of Biotic Integrity (IBI), while data from the macroinvertebrate sampling were used to calculate diversity indices as well as IBI. At the time this study was conducted, anthropogenic discharges into the South Canadian River did not appear to be affecting the fish and macroinvertebrate communities in an adverse manner at the sites sampled. Residual contaminants, possibly associated with past discharges, were detected in sediments throughout the stream, but with the exception of nickel, these contaminants were below levels where adverse effects to fish and wildlife resources would be expected to occur. In comparison to other lotic systems, the fish and microinvertebrate assemblages measured within the South Canadian River during the course of this study were classified as limited to intermediate; however, this appears to be more of a factor associated with natural conditions (elevated salinity and periods of limited surface water flow), the lowering of groundwater levels, and the construction of surface water impoundments (Meredith, Ute, and Conchas Reservoirs) within the watershed which have modified in-stream habitat and flow regimes rather than to actual discharges.",
