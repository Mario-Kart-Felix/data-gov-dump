The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile isn          designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.n          n          Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs) are defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and consist of two or more adjacent Core Based Statistical Areasn          (CBSAs) that have significant employment interchanges.  The CBSAs that combine to create a CSA retain separate identities within the larger CSA.  Because CSAsn          represent groupings of CBSAs, they should not be ranked or compared with individual CBSAs.nn          The CSA boundaries are those defined by OMB based on the 2010 Census and published in 2013.",
