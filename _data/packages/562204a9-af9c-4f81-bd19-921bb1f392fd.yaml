    of land use density and functional characteristics such as regional location and
    links to major transportation corridors. Example centers serve to illustrate reinvestment
    opportunity areas derived through discussions with local officials, as well as qualitative
    and quantitative analysis, but do not comprise an exhaustive list. Many rural communities
