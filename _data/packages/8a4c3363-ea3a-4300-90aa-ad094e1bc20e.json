	"notes": "Preliminary screening assessments for abnormal amphibians were initiated on national wildlife refuges (NWRs) in the southeast region in 2000, with additional refuges included in each subsequent year (2001-2008) (Table 1). Seven national wildlife refuges in the Southeast Region were assessed during 2008 (Figure 1). Three new refuges were sampled this year including Coldwater River, Banks Lake and Okefenokee NWRs. Choctaw, Noxubee, and St. Vincent NWRs participated in their second year of sampling. Clarks River NWR, Kentuckyu2019s only NWR, completed its second consecutive year of sampling in 2008 and its third year overall. Successful collections were conducted at Clarks River (n=6), Coldwater River (n=3), Noxubee (n=5), and Okefenokee (n=5) NWRs, but not at Banks Lake, Choctaw, or St. Vincent NWRs because of a sparse number of metamorphs. During 2008, the incidence of abnormalities exceeded background levels (3 percent; Dubois 1979, Johnson and Lunde 2001, Ouellet et al. 1997, Stocum 2000) in two of five samples taken from Noxubee NWR (3.8-3.9% abnormal) and one of three samples taken from Coldwater River NWR (8.9% abnormal). As with the previous reports, the abnormalities encountered consisted primarily of missing or clubbed digits, feet, or limbs. Other observations such as variant colorations, abrasions and similarly obvious soft tissue damages were not reported as abnormalities. A total of 13 abnormal specimens were collected across the Southeast Region during 2008 during the collection of 1164 individuals from full collections and several hundred more from partial collections. The abnormal specimens collected were preserved and shipped for radiographic analysis to Dr. Mike Lannoo at Indiana University School of Medicine, Terre Haute, Indiana with the exception of the 2 samples from collection NXB12 (Fowleru2019s toad) which were lost prior to submission for radiology. Examination and final determination for specimens examined by Dr. Lannoo have not yet been received. Interpretations of the pending radiographs will lead to the final determinations on the field results. Samples of live metamorphs were not successfully collected for parasitological analysis this year. The primary goal of the Abnormal Amphibian Monitoring Project for 2008 season was the completion of data validation and quality assurance to ensure the best possible evaluation of the cumulative data. This validation was performed to facilitate the analysis of the regionu2019s, as well as the nationu2019s, cumulative survey data. The regional and national data have been analyzed and a draft report is currently in review. Based on the outcome of the cumulative data analysis, the strategy for the upcoming 2009 season will include 3 main components. First, the national and region cumulative data review and analysis will be completed. Second, several refuges were determined to require follow up surveys based on the initial refuge results (high abnormality rates). Of these, both Overflow and Felsenthal will be able to perform follow up amphibian surveys in 2009. And finally, the program will continue to expand to include consecutive sampling years at more refuges in the Southeastern Region. Coldwater River NWR in Mississippi and Okefenokee and Banks Lake NWRs in Georgia will continue sampling in 2009 for their second year of sampling each. Relative geographic location of refuges to be sampled during the 2009 season is shown in Figure 2.",
