    NASA and industry stakeholders to facilitate design, identify materials, novel fabrication
    processes, and conduct validation testing and analysis of a lightweight airlock
    hatch system test article.&amp;nbsp; MASH project will meet its objective through
    a combination of concept designs and trades, system and conop requirements definition,
    component development, and system design, fabrication, and testing in conjunction
    with mission architecture and operations studies.&amp;nbsp; The project will address
    mission needs, technical challenges, risks related to the use of soft goods materials
    and structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MASH project has 2 elements.&amp;nbsp; The
    first element is a series of trade studies and evaluations that will 1) establish
    basic requirements and figure of merits (FOM) for the hatch system, 2) evaluate
    hatch concepts against requirements and FOMs, 3) survey candidate materials for
    hatch design, and 4) support mission impact studies that will inform the hatch design
    requirements. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second element (WBS 2.2),
    hatch technology development, uses a building block approach to systematically develop
    and demonstrate a soft goods hatch system.&amp;nbsp; The approach includes design,
    analysis, fabrication and testing of first, hatch components and then, an integrated
    hatch system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In FY14, the requirements and FOMs were determined
    from existing NASA standards for soft good structures and hatch design as well as
    customer needs. An initial trade evaluation informed the design of the hatch system
    at the beginning of the project and down selected a minimal set of design options.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    This minimal set of concept options will be matured with analysis and design details
    in the first quarter of FY15.&amp;nbsp; A final trade evaluation with updated requirements
    and FOMS will be conducted to select a primary hatch design for maturation, fabrication
    and demonstration.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In addition, a materials survey will be conducted
    to inform the current state of the art (SOA) and advance material options for the
    hatch system design.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In FY15, the MASH project will
    work with a HAT vehicle analysis team to define a reference airlock.&amp;nbsp; The
    reference airlock will be used to inform and evaluate the performance of the hatch
    system against the key performance parameters, mass and volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In
    FY15 MASH will also futher the technology development of a soft goods hatch system
    design.&amp;nbsp; Material candidate(s) from the materials survey and performance
    evaluations will be selected for implementation into the hatch design.&amp;nbsp;
    Design analysis cycles will be conducted to inform fabrication of hatch components.&amp;nbsp;
    Hatch components will be experimentally tested to validate performance.&amp;nbsp;
    Specifically, sealing tests for required pressure loads and packaging evaluations
    will be peformed.&amp;nbsp; The design, analysis, and component test validation
    along with customer needs will inform a final hatch design for a hatch system demonstration
    in FY16.&amp;nbsp; The potential customers will be invited to participate in the
    design selection and evaluation to ensure the soft hatch design continues to be
    relevant to their needs.&amp;nbsp; The technical review of the final hatch system
    design will be conducted prior to a continuation review of the project, and fabrication
    of a hatch system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In FY16 MASH project activities will
    focus on the fabrication and experimental testing of the integrated hatch system.
    &amp;nbsp;Design details for fabrication and the procurment statement of work (SOW)
    will be completed and ready for award the first quarter of FY16.&amp;nbsp; An award
    kick-off and an intermin review for fabrication will be held during the fabrication
    process to ensure the fabrication of the hatch will meet requirements.&amp;nbsp;
    On reciept of the fabricated hatch system, evaluations&amp;nbsp; will include analysis
    focused on structural performance for require loads and test evaluations focused
    on packaging to detemine compact stowage parameters.&amp;nbsp; Analysis and hardware
    evaluation will assess the expected mass of the system.&amp;nbsp; Operation functions
    will be defined and examined in conjunction with customer needs and requirements.&amp;nbsp;
    A final technical review of the design, analysis, and evaluations will be conduct
    to confirm the level of TRL advancement of the MASH project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key
    Deliverables:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MASH project will provide potential users with
    a soft hatch concept of operations, detailed design, interface, and performance
    information, as well as the results of formal trade studies and test results at
    the completion of the project (FY16).&amp;nbsp; Interim reports and presentations
    will also be provided throughout the project.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
