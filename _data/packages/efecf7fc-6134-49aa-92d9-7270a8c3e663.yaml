  backscatter mosaic of the bathymetry of a reef shelf/bank and the steep slopes and
  canyons of the NE Reserve, offshore of Fajardo, Puerto Rico. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA
  Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory,
  federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the
  Northeast Reserve from 3/05/2013 to 3/29/2013. Data was acquired with a moon pool
  mounted Reson 7125 multibeam echosounder (400 kHz). Data is in UTM zone 20 north,
  datum NAD83. The backscatter component of the bathymetry data were geometrically
  and radiometrically corrected using .HSX and .7k file pairs that were converted
  to GSF in Hypack 2012, then processed in Fledermaus Geocoder Toolbox 7.3.3c. Acoustic
  backscatter mosaics are an important piece of information when characterizing surficial
  seafloor features and delineating benthic habitats. The project was conducted to
  meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth.
  All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to
  their own needs and standards.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819\",\n\t\"extras\":
