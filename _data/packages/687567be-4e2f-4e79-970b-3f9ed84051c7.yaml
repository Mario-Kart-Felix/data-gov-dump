    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "This dataset depicts the terrestrial boundaries
    of the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCC) within Alaska. Those LCCs are:
    Aleutian and Bering Sea Islands, Arctic, North Pacific, Northwest Boreal, and Western
    Alaska. These boundaries are derived from the master LCC Boundary dataset maintained
    by USFWS, but portions of these polygons have been modified. The specific modification
    are listed below: ARCTIC LCC: Portions of the polygon were edited to more closely
    match the coastline and the boundary was also edited to include the Colville River.
    WESTERN ALASKA LCC: Nulato Hills expansion: There are a number of reasons why the
    boundary of the Western Alaska LCC (WALCC) was modified to include the Nulato Hills
    Ecoregion. First, this Ecoregion is a transitional zone that fits equally well within
    either the WALCC or the Northwest Boreal LCC. Also, the Nulato Hills are the primary
    land route linking the northern and southern portions of the WALCC and as such,
    will likely serve as a conduit allowing species to migrate north from more southern
    portions of the LCC. Finally, including the Nulato Hills as part of WALCC was advantageous
    because it encouraged close coordination among stakeholders involved in establishing
    the LCC and completion of the Bureau of Land Managementu00e2u0080u0099s Seward Peninsula-Nulato
    Hills-Kotzebue Lowlands Rapid Ecoregional Assessment. Lake Clark expansion: The
    south central portion of the WALCC was modified so that it included all the watersheds
    that flow into Bristol Bay. Yukon River drainage contraction: The villages of Koyukuk,
    Nulato, Kaltag, Grayling, Anvik, and Holy Cross are including within the NWBLCC.
    These Athabascan communities have more cultural similarities to other villages within
    the NWBLCC, and are represented by the Alaska Native non-governmental organization,
    Tanana Chiefs Conference, which participates in the NWBLCC LCC partnership community.
    The final boundary in the Nulato Hills area was placed at the hydrological divide
    between the Norton Sound and the tributaries of the Yukon and Koyukuk Rivers. This
    is a logical division from a geographic and ecological perspective, particularly
    with respect to the fisheries resources and the terrestrial vegetation types of
    the area. NORTHWEST BOREAL LCC: Nulato Hills contraction: Portions of the Nulato
    Hills art of the Lime Hills ecorgeion were removed. Yukon River drainage expansion:
    The villages of Koyukuk, Nulato, Kaltag, Grayling, Anvik, and Holy Cross are including
    within the NWBLCC. These Athabascan communities have more cultural similarities
    to other villages within the NWBLCC, and are represented by the Alaska Native non-governmental
    organization, Tanana Chiefs Conference, which participates in the NWBLCC partnership
    community. The final boundary in the Nulato Hills area was placed at the hydrological
    divide between the Norton Sound and the tributaries of the Yukon and Koyukuk Rivers.
    This is a logical division from a geographic and ecological perspective, particularly
    with respect to the fisheries resources and the terrestrial vegetation types of
    the area. Lake Clark contraction: The southwest portion of the LCC was modified
    so that all the watersheds that flow into Bristol Bay now belong to WALCC.",nt"license_title":
