    are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land
    Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal
    agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the
    National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Bureau
    of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).
    Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle.
    These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic
    layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database
    (NLCD 2001 2011 Edition) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent
    imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit
    Product. With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between
    the image capture date and product release. In some areas, the land cover can undergo
    significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually
    out of date. To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD
    2006 2011 Edition) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent
    land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time
    between image capture and product release. NLCD 2006 (2011 edition) is designed
    to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that
    can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring
    between 2001 (2011 Edition) and 2006 (2011 Edition) for the conterminous United
    States at medium spatial resolution. For NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition), there are 4 primary
    data products: 1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Edition); 2) NLCD 2001/2006 Land Cover
    Change Pixels (2011 Edition) labeled with the 2006 land cover class; 3) NLCD 2006
    Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 Edition), and 4) NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed
    Imperviousness Change (2011 Edition). In addition, ancillary metadata includes the
    NLCD 2006 Path/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs
    used to derive 2001/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates included
    in the attribute table. As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2001 data products
    have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition) to provide full compatibility with
    all other NLCD 2011 Edition products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the
    over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes. Land cover maps,
    derivatives and all associated documents are considered "provisional" until a
    formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. The NLCD 2006 is created on a path/row
    basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. Questions about the NLCD
    2006 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2006 land cover mapping team
    at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.",nt"license_title":
