	"notes": "SSC needs the sensors that are capable and can be operated in liquid oxygen (LOX) and or liquid hydrogen (LH2) cryogenic environment to improve SSC cryogenic testing.  In particular, the Stennis Space Center (SSC) would like to develop a sensor to monitor the quality of LOX in the delivery line during the testing of a rocket engine.  Spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) with its relative simplicity and multi-molecule analysis can be easily employed to develop a sensor for on-line, real-time measurement. The goal of the proposed effort is to develop a SRS sensor, which is able to provide sub-millisecond sampling time for detecting nitrogen percent concentration in cryogenic propellants. During Phase I, a SRS system based on photo multiplier tube detection will be designed. The experimental parameters will be evaluated to achieve optimum response time and sensitivity. A prototype will be delivered to NASA/SSC at the end of Phase I. The study from Phase I will provide the necessary information to improve the phase II prototype design to achieve sub millisecond response time and better sensitivity. In Phase II, a prototype SRS system will be developed and tested at SSC and will be delivered to NASA/SSC for on line measurement",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
