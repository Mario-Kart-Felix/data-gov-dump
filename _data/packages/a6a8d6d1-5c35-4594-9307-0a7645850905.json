	"notes": "This data set contains data on the type and amount of marine resources that are discarded or interacted with by vessels that are selected to report to the Southeast Fisheries Science Centers Coastal Fisheries Logbook Program. The supplemental discard program was initiated by the SEFSC in July 2001 and data collection began in August. To reduce the reporting burden on the fishermen, a 20 sample of the vessels with a Gulf of Mexico, South Atlantic snapper-grouper, king mackerel, Spanish mackerel or shark permit was selected to report. To assure that the sample is representative of the total universe of vessels with Federal permits, a stratified, random sample is selected from the universe of all vessels with the above types of Federal permits. The first year a 3 tiered stratification was used. One tier was geographical, and the universe was divided into two geographical strata - the Gulf of Mexico (Florida Keys to the Texas-Mexican border) and the South Atlantic (which extends from the North Carolina - Virginia border to the Florida Keys). The second stratum was based on the type of gear. There were 5 categories in this stratum - handline, longline, trolling, trap and gill nets. The third stratum was based on the fishing activity of the vessels during calendar year 2000. There were two strata in this tier - (1) vessels that made between 1 and 10 trips and (2) vessels that made more than 10 trips. In all, there were 20 strata for the sampling in the first year. However, there were too few boats that used gill nets in the Gulf of Mexico, so all of the boats that used gill nets in the Gulf were combined into a single stratum. As a result, 20 of the vessels in the in 19 strata were selected at random to submit a discard form along with their regular coastal fisheries logbook form for each trip. For subsequent years, the strata were reduced to only two, instead of three. The fishing activity stratum was eliminated because too many of the vessels changed their fishing patterns and moved to a different stratum throughout the year. Consequently, 10 strata, two geographical and 5 gear strata, continue to be used for random selections of vessels that are required to submit their discard information. In addition, the selections are made without replacement. That is, if a vessel is selected, it is removed from selection for the next couple of years, until all vessels have been selected in the respective strata. Fishermen are asked to provide the numbers of fish or shellfish that they discarded during the fishing trip. They are also asked to record any interactions with marine mammals or endangered species that they had during the trip. In addition, they are asked to estimate the condition of the fish (animals) when they were released. The fishermen are given 6 options for the condition of released fish. These options are all animals are dead, majority of the animals are dead, all animals are alive when released, majority of animals are alive, the fish are kept but not sold, and the condition of the animals is unknown. The fishermen are also asked to specify one of two reasons why the fish (animals) were discarded. The choices are either regulatory discards or because the fish were not marketable.",
