    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "With recent advancements in prognostics
    methodologies there has been a significant interest in maturing Prognostics and
    Health Management (PHM) to increase its technology readiness level for onboard deployments.
    Active research is underway both in industry and academia to address shortcomings
    in availability of run-to-failure data, accelerated aging environments, real-time
    prognostics algorithms, uncertainty representation and management (URM) techniques,
    prognostics performance evaluation, etc., to name a few. At this juncture it is
    highly desirable to close the loop by connecting the high level customer requirements
    for mission planning and execution to performance specifications for prognostics
    methodologies at the lower technical level. This calls for integrating the pragmatics
    of safety, reliability, cost, and real-time viability into the prognostics methodologies
    to establish a connection between top-down and bottom-up approaches currently pursued
    in the PHM community. In this paper we identify key areas that must be addressed
    to bridge these gaps and provide an overview of how these areas have been addressed
    in part at various levels. We also discuss on how these issues can be further developed
    into a comprehensive and more coherent portfolio of technologies that will ultimately
    lead to specifying guidelines for prognostics performance.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
