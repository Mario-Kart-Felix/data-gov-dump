	"notes": "We build a tool that accelerates Research and Development (R&amp;D) aimed at introducing Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS).  In the proposed effort, FACET will form the basis of a collaborative R&amp;D platform, an environment where users can share open source software modules (software and data sets developed to reside outside the FACET Application Programmers Interface (API)) between users at the same or different universities, so that each user can benefit from the open source software and data contributions of others.  Thus, when a student who has never used FACET before enters into a collaborative study of UAS integration in the NAS, he/she is able to download open source software and data to get going on rich R&amp;D experiment without having to start from scratch.  A student can download weather data sets, Special Use Airspace (SUA) data, air traffic demand data, UAS models (e.g., Base of Aircraft Data (BADA)) and flight plans, metrics, or anything that is posted on the open source library, to get a "running start" with R&amp;D.  When completing innovative modules outside the API, the student can post software to the open source repository for others to benefit.  This collaborative environment will also allow for FACET-based research to be performed in a distributed manner &amp;#150; where simulations at one university may be run with models and parameters provided by other users at different universities, and the results posted back to the common repository for all users to share.  This open-source collaborative platform is demonstrated on R&amp;D problems aimed at introducing",

What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
