    have been studied for many decades as a means to protect crew from deep space radiation&amp;nbsp;environments.
    These studies yield architectures that are significantly massive and too costly
    to launch and assemble in space largely&amp;nbsp;due to the magnet size and field
    strength required to deflect galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) spectra and solar particle
    events (SPE)&amp;nbsp;for meaningful crew protection in space. Since then state-of-the-art
    superconducting technology has made great strides in performance&amp;nbsp;including
    higher temperature superconductivity (HTS) and greater current carrying capacity
    allowing for simpler magnet cooling&amp;nbsp;systems and greater magnetic field
    strength per unit mass.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Phase I, the pros and
    cons of more than 20 potential coil configurations were analyzed by Advanced Magnet
    Lab (AML) personnel and INFN with the University of Perugia. Substantial progress
    has been made to develop a feasible solution for the required large HTS coils. The
    work performed showed that single layer expandable coils with diameters of 4 to
    8 m and lengths of 15 to 20 m, arranged in a 6-around-1 configuration constitute
    the best solution among all concepts analyzed. The single compensator coil closely
    surrounds the habitat serving as a habitat thermal radiation shield for the outer
    coils and compensates for outer coil fringe fields trying to enter the habitat.
    AML has secured separate funding from Space Florida to demonstrate the concept of
    expandable HTS coils. The phase 2 proposal effort will continue with the creative
    method of the &amp;ldquo;expandable&amp;rdquo; coil concept. The team will refine
    the structural concept to house such a coil assembly. This will include a more comprehensive
    structural loads analysis and structural design to manage field forces on each of
    the coils and the habitat. Concept design and analysis will include effects of the
    compensation coil on the entire system. The team will evaluate safety implications
    for the phase 1 coil concept including quench performance, fault scenarios and mitigation
    strategies.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
