	"notes": "Fuel cell air handling systems require clean and contaminant-free inlet air, which dictates that oil-free, motorized, compressor/expander systems should be used.  Although there is no sliding contact in the steady state operation of the foil bearing, occasional contact between the foil and journal surfaces at startup and shutdown and during overload situations, could limit the bearing life.  Therefore, to ensure that the compressor system is highly efficient and reliable the foil air bearings need wear resistant, low friction coatings.  rnrnThe objective of the proposed STTR investigation is to identify new coatings for use in fuel cell propulsion compressor bearings that would allow the foil bearing to be functional from low temperature start-up conditions to the maximum temperatures encountered during operation. The proposed program will build on a novel hydrogenated diamond like carbon (DLC) coating developed at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). The goal of this joint MiTi&lt;SUP&gt;REG&lt;/SUP&gt; and ANL STTR Phase I program is to demonstrate the feasibility of ANL hydrogenated DLC and MiTi&lt;SUP&gt;REG&lt;/SUP&gt; KorolonTM coating technology for fuel cell propulsion compressor bearings.  This will be accomplished through coating adhesion and tribological testing of the coatings against various potential shaft coatings such as the NASA developed PS304 and/or Korolon 1350B.rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
