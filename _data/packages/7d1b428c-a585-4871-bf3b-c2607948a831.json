	"notes": "This proposal is for the development of a highly extensible and user-configurable software application for end-to-end mission simulation and design. We will leverage the plug-and-play architecture of our existing  simulation, visualization and command software, developing new capabilities for data fusion, operations planning, plan validation, and adjustable automation. The core application, VisualCommander, has been developed over the last 4 years under SBIR and IR&amp;D funding as a revolutionary way of providing integrated design and simulation from mission conception through  mission operations. The software design of VisualCommander (VC) has been driven by the goals of extensibility, re-use of functionality, and user-configurability. As such, it serves as an ideal foundation upon which to build additional in-depth functions that are valuable for this purpose. VisualCommander is designed to integrate legacy engineering software with user-generated design and simulation tools into a single, user-friendly environment. It automates the flow of data between analysis, design, and simulation applications with minimal user manipulation. rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
