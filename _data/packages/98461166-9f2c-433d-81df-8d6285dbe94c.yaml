  true,\n\t\"url\": null,\n\t\"notes\": \"A prognostic system makes it possible to
  anticipate loss of functionality before it occurs with sufficient lead time to take
  actions that mitigate the impact of this loss. We focus on the forms of mitigation
  within the flight vehicle that influence the operational dynamics but do not directly
  amend the mission plan. Thus, we focus upon the reconfiguration of the feedback
  control strategy for the flight system.rnrnThe high degree of complexity in the
  design and dynamics of modern aircraft is typically handled using a hierarchical
  control scheme in which there are several levels of control at increasing levels
  of responsibility: the component level, the subsystem level, and the system level.
  Our reconfiguration strategy involves mitigating problems that are detected at the
  component level at both the level in which the fault is detected and higher levels
  as well. There are, thus, two subproblems to the reconfiguration: (a) an adaptive
  control problem at the lower level to extend component life and derive new component
  performance limits, and (b) a supervisory control problem at the higher level to
  adapt the system controller to maximize system capability while respecting the performance
  limitations. Since our reconfiguration occurs in the context of a dynamic system,
  we need to respect the stability implications of the reconfiguration. To address
  this, we apply bandwidth analyses at the component level and the systems level in
  a robust performance context. A conservative criterion for stability is to impose
  rate limits for reconfiguration that insure that undesired, and possibly unmodeled,
  modes of behavior are not driven by reconfiguration activities. For specific hardware,
  extensions beyond this conservative approach may be warranted (e.g. to catch faulty
  behavior) and validated on a case-by-case basis, essentially by extending the component
  modeling to include a model of behavior under certain types of reconfiguration.\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
