Reputational risks arernparticularly common in developing countries whererninfrastructure and/or regulation may not be sufficientrnto provide all users with access to safe and reliablerndrinking water supplies. Regulatory risks are defined asrnthe exposure to the impacts of water-related regulationsrnon a given company. As physical and reputational pressuresrnincrease, many local and national governmentsrnare responding with more stringent water policies.rnIf unanticipated, these regulatory changes can proverncostly to companies and, in some cases, limit industrialrnactivities in particular geographic areas.",
