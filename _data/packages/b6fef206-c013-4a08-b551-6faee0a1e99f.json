	"notes": "An integrated environment for rapid design studies of small satellite missions will be developed. This environment will be designed to streamline processes at the NASA Ames Mission Design Center. Several key concepts are introduced. The proposed environment introduces modern Product Data Management and Product Lifecycle Management (PDM\/PLM) tools and processes to satellite mission design. Specifically, the notion of product structure, or bill of material (BOM), is expanded to a simulation BOM, or SBOM, with the capability to manage engineering analysis data, files and processes in the context of a product, in this case satellite mission. This approach constitutes a significant step beyond mere document management, which limits the traceability of which model of which analysis belongs to which version of the geometry or other analysis. It is a key enabler for model re-use. A Linked Model Environment (LME), i.e. an environment where all engineering analysis models are associatively linked, which was developed concurrently in the commercial aerospace and automotive industry, will extended to satellite mission design. This environment significantly reduces the amount of manual intervention engineers have to perform to translate information from one simulation tool to another. The concept of digital mockup (DMU), which typically addresses form and fit of components in an assembly, is expanded to include function, such that the inclusion of components in a satellite assembly that are functionally incompatible is rejected. Repetitive-iterative engineering tasks will be automated with the help of an integration framework tool which automates the execution of a sequence of codes and provides the capability to wrap drivers like optimizers or quality engineering tools around an automated analysis workflow.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
