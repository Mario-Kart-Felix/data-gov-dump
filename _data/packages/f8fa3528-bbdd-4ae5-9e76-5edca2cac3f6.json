	"notes": "Future NASA space exploration missions will use nanometer-scale electronic technologies which call for a shift in how radiation effects in such devices and materials are viewed. The energy deposition by ionizing particles (so called single event effects) can no longer be treated as an average deposition (linear energy transfer, LET). Nano-scale electronic device responses are strongly related to the microstructure of the radiation event. This requires a much more detailed physics-based modeling approach. It is also important to convert such results into engineering models used in device and circuit designs. Hence, the proposed innovation: detailed high-energy-physics-based simulations of radiation events efficiently coupled with advanced device response computations. The innovative Technology Transfer: interface specification and implementation to allow smooth, automated integration between Vanderbilt University high-energy particle advanced computations and CFDRC Device Simulator, and to enable statistically meaningful runs on a massively parallel supercomputing cluster. Significance for NASA:  the impact of such radiation events has implications for nano-scale devices operating in space exploration environments. The new approach to understanding the single-event response of semiconductor materials, devices, and circuits is necessary for reliable engineering models used for early design assessment, radiation hardening, and to reduce the amount of radiation testing cost and time.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
