	"notes": "Broadband fan noise ? closely tied to turbulent flow on and around the fan blades ? represents a key challenge to the noise reduction community due to the interaction of a highly turbulent flow field with complex, moving geometries. Prediction and high-fidelity simulation of fan noise demands a fundamental innovation in CFD methods due to moving geometries and accuracy requirements. The objective this work is to develop a flexible approach to handling multiple, overset grids for use in simulations of turbomachinery. In Phase 1 we will develop an innovative computational software tool for efficiently managing multiple, overlapping structured meshes in relative motion. This application will be used concurrently with a compressible Navier-Stokes solver and is an enabling technology in enabling high-fidelity simulations of turbulent flows in complex, moving geometries. Phase 1 will demonstrate software feasibility using a simplified model of the NASA Glenn Source Diagnostic Test (SDT) fan at realistic take-off conditions. We propose a simulation that includes a moving "rotor" blade row adjacent to a static blade row. Tailored post-processing of simulation results will provide information on the turbulent flow ? and implied turbulent noise sources ? including unsteady blade surface pressures, acoustic modes, and overall radiated noise. In Phase 2 we focus primarily on broadband turbulent noise sources of modern turbofan engines. By utilizing a realistic NASA SDT fan geometry and take-off flow conditions, we will use our new tools to simulate real-world systems and commercialize our software product.",

What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
