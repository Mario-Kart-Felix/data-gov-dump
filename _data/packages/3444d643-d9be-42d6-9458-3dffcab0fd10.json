	"notes": "The U.S. Geological Survey's Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) collects aerial photography of the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) floodplain on a regular basis. These data are used to support the Center's long-term goals of understanding the UMRS and developing useful products for the Long Term Resource Monitoring Program (LTRMP). In 2000, 1:16,000-scale true color aerial photos were collected on the Mississippi River from Cairo, IL to Minneapolis, MN and the on Illinois River from its confluence with the Mississippi near Grafton, IL to Lake Michigan\/Chicago, IL. The photos were collected using a 60% stereo overlap between photos in the same flight line and a 30% overlap between flight lines. At the time this document was prepared, UMESC was in the process of scanning, georeferencing and compiled approximately every other photo into georeferenced mosaics for the navigation pools. These mosaics are served as compressed .sid images, so they'll be easier to download vial the Internet. Note: While the photos have been georeferenced, they have not been orthorectified.",
