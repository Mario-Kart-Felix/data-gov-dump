    of a constant recharge value for the Enid isolated terrace aquifer in northwestern
    Oklahoma. The Enid isolated terrace aquifer covers approximately 82 square miles
    and supplies water for irrigation, domestic, municipal, and industrial use for the
    City of Enid and western Garfield County. The Quaternary-age Enid isolated terrace
    aquifer is composed of terrace deposits that consist of discontinuous layers of
    clay, sandy clay, sand, and gravel. The aquifer is unconfined and is bounded by
    the underlying Permian-age Hennessey Group on the east and the Cedar Hills Sandstone
    Formation of the Permian-age El Reno Group on the west. Cedar Hills Sandstone Formation
    fills a channel beneath the thickest section of the Enid isolated terrace aquifer
    in the midwestern part of the aquifer. The polygons boundary was digitized from
    a photocopy of a paper map from a ground-water modeling thesis and report. The map
    digitized was published at a scale of 1:62,500. The recharge value reported in the
    ground-water modeling thesis and report for the Enid isolated terrace aquifer is
    2.3 inches per year. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that
    simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations
    of aquifer characteristics may produce similar results. Therefore, values of recharge
    used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within
    a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data.",nt"license_title":

    digitized from a map published at a scale of 1:62,500 and represents the recharge
    polygon as reported by Beausoleil (1981) on plate 4. The recharge polygon represented
    at this scale is indicative of broad, regional trends and should not be interpreted
    as site specific. The recharge polygon was digitized from a photocopy of a paper
    map (19.0 inches by 17.5 inches) with a maximum registration root-mean-squared error
    (RMSE) of 0.007 map inches (0.018 map centimeters) and 36 feet (11 meters) ground
    distance. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and
    aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer
    characteristics may produce similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge
    are closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are in balance the model
    has a small mean residual; it represents the natural system numerically. If the
    hydraulic conductivity is accurately known, the model can be used to accurately
    determine recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly known, then
    the recharge will be poorly determined. Therefore, values of recharge used in the
    model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable
    range when compared to independently collected data. Recharge probably varies considerably
    over the local area, and model recharge is at best an average over an area at least
