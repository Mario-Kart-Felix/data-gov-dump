    and metals on fish and wildlife of the lower Gila River and associated agricultural
    drainage canals in Maricopa County, Arizona, were investigated in 1994-95. Residues
    of DDT, an insecticide that has been suspended from use in Arizona for 25 years,
    are still present in fish, turtles, and birds. DDT was detected in 86, 62, and 50%
    of the fish collected from Buckeye Canal, Gillespie Dam, and Allenville, respectively.
    DDT was recovered in all turtles from Gillespie Dam, and in all black-crowned night-herons
    from Painted Rock. DDE residues in fish from the lower Gila River drainage were
    the highest in the United States associated with agriculturally applied pesticides.
    Although DDE residues declined over the past decade; current levels remain extremely
    high. DDE was present at concentrations known to impact biotic resources. Fish collected
    from agricultural drainage canals generally contained higher DDE residues than fish
    from the river. DDE residues were highest in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) from
    Buckeye Canal (11.17 ug/g wet weight), an agricultural drain and tributary to the
    Gila River. The overall frequency of occurrence of organochlorine compounds is declining,
    however, as only 6 compounds were detected in samples collected in 1994-95 versus
    16 recovered in samples collected from the same sites in 1985. Residues of all other
    pesticides and PCBs were below levels associated with adverse effects on fish and
    wildlife. Concentrations of 11 potentially toxic metals were detected in fish. Carp
    collected near Allenville had the second highest aluminum concentration ever recorded
    in Arizona. Copper exceeded the national 85th percentile in 31 of 48 samples. Because
    of its occurrence at relatively high levels and its propensity to interact with
    other compounds and elements, copper remains a contaminant of concern. Concentrations
    of most metals remained unchanged from 1985 to 1994-95. Spiny softshell turtles
    (Trionyx spiniferus) generally contained higher organochlorine and metal concentrations
    than fish. DDE and most metals were highest in turtles from the middle river sampling
    sites. Residues of DDE and chlordane declined by about one-half from 1985 to 1994-95.
    PCB, dieldrin, and DDT levels remained relatively constant over the past decade
    while copper, nickel, vanadium, and zinc concentrations declined. Levels of arsenic,
    mercury, and selenium in turtles collected in 1994-95 were statistically similar
    to concentrations in turtles collected in 1985. Whiptail lizards (Cnemodophorus
    spp.) collected from areas adjacent to the lower Gila River contained higher organochlorine
    residues than lizards collected from other Arizona locations. DDE and selenium exceeded
    toxic threshold levels that could be hazardous to avian predators that consume a
    large proportion of lizards in their diet. Mean mercury concentrations increased
    from 1985 to 1994-95 and were about 3- to 10-times higher in lizards collected in
    the Gila River basin than in lizards from other Arizona locations. DDE, mercury,
    and selenium pose a significant environmental challenge to black-crowned night-herons
    (Nycticorax nycticorax) and possibly to other avian species nesting and wintering
    on the lower Gila River. All night-heron and two of four red-winged blackbird (Agelaius
    phoeniceus) carcasses contained > 3.4 ug/g wet weight DDE; the level associated
    with impaired reproduction. One-half of the blackbird carcasses contained sufficiently
    high DDE residues to represent a hazard to predatory birds that regularly feed on
    blackbirds. Mercury concentrations in five of six night-heron livers approached
    or exceeded the toxic threshold and the maximum concentration, 28.07 ug/g dry weight,
    was 4.5-times higher than the toxic threshold. Selenium concentrations in night-heron
    livers (13 - 18 ug/g dry weight) indicate that adults are not at risk of selenium
    intoxication, but selenium impacts on reproduction are possible.",nt"license_title":
