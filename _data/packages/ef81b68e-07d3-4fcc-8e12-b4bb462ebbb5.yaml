    Row River from Dorena dam to the confluence with the Coast Fork; Coast Fork from
    Cottage Grove dam to the confluence with the Middle Fork; Silk Creek from River
    Mile 1.7 to the confluence with the Coast Fork. The basis for these features is
    the Willamette Flood Insurance Study u00e2u0080u0093 Phase One (2013). The hydraulics
    and hydrology for the FIS were reused in the production of these polygons; the reports
    and information associated with the FIS are applicable to this product. The Digital
    Elevation Model (DEM) utilized for the Willamette FIS submittal was produced by
    combining multiple overlapping topographic surveys for the Middle Fork and Coast
    Fork of the Willamette River. This DEM was created from four sources: LiDAR of the
    Springfield area that was flown in 2008, LiDAR of Silk Creek that was flown in 2011,
    LiDAR of Fall Creek that was flown in 2012, and photogrammetry of the Middle Fork
    and Coast Fork of the Willamette River that was flown in 2004. In areas where no
    high-resolution elevation data were available, USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED)
    data were used to supplement the DEM. The shapefiles Hi_Res_Extents.shp and Low_Res_Extents.shp
    define the limits of these areas. The horizontal datum of the DEM is NAD 1983 State
    Plane-Oregon South HARN with units of International Feet (NAD83). The vertical datum
    of the elevation model is NAVD 1988 with units of international feet (NAVD-88).
    In addition, some areas show surveyed bathymetry within the channel. These can be
    noted by the sharp increase in apparent depth, creating a stripe across the depth
    grid when compared to the LiDAR data, which represents the water surface elevation
    at the time of the aerial data collection. Bridge decks are generally removed from
    DEMs as standard practice. Therefore, these features may be shown as inundated when
    they are not. An effort to clip flood extents on bridge decks was made, but judgement
    should be used when estimating the usefulness of a bridge during flood flow. Comparing
    the bridge to the surrounding ground can be more informative in this respect than
    simply looking at the bridge itself. The features and depth grids stop as the Coast
    Fork approaches the Middle Fork on the northern end of the reach. See cfwgoshOR_breach.shp
    for information regarding this file. This represents the depth grid for the 33,900

    Constraints: The estimated inundated areas are based on flows at the Goshen gage
    (USGS 14157500), using the Willamette FIS Hydrology Report (phase one). The hydrology
    of a specific storm will likely be different than presented. This feature should
    never be separated from the feature classes Hi_Res_Extents and Low_Res_Extents,
    which delineate the areas of 1m LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and NED data.
    The area downstream of the confluence with the Middle Fork (forming the mainstem
    Willamette River) is shown in the Middle feature class. Flooding that is not due
    to the Coast Fork, Row or Silk Creek within the reaches shown above is not reflected
    in this feature class. Uncertainties and Limitations for Use of Flood-Inundation
    Maps: Although the flood-inundation maps represent the boundaries of inundated areas
    with a distinct line, some uncertainty is associated with these maps. The flood
    boundaries shown were estimated based on water stages and streamflows at the USGS
    streamflow-gaging station 14157500, Coastal Fork Willamette River Near Goshen, OR.
    Water-surface elevations along the stream reaches were estimated by steady-state
    hydraulic modeling, assuming unobstructed flow, and using streamflows and hydrologic
    conditions anticipated at the USGS streamgage. The hydraulic model reflects the
    land-cover characteristics and any bridge, dam, levee, or other hydraulic structures
    existing as of 2011. Unique meteorological factors (timing and distribution of precipitation)
    may cause actual streamflows along the modeled reach to vary from those assumed
    during a flood, which may lead to deviations in the water-surface elevations and
    inundation boundaries shown. Additional areas may be flooded due to unanticipated
    conditions such as: changes in the streambed elevation or roughness, backwater into
    major tributaries along a main stem river, or backwater from localized debris or
    ice jams. The accuracy of the floodwater extent portrayed on these maps will vary
    with the accuracy of the digital elevation model used to simulate the land surface.
    Additional uncertainties and limitations pertinent to this study may be described
    elsewhere in this report. If this series of flood-inundation maps will be used in
    conjunction with National Weather Service (NWS) river forecasts, the user should
    be aware of additional uncertainties that may be inherent or factored into NWS forecast
    procedures. The NWS uses forecast models to estimate the quantity and timing of
    water flowing through selected stream reaches in the United States. These forecast
    models (1) estimate the amount of runoff generated by precipitation and snowmelt,
    (2) simulate the movement of floodwater as it proceeds downstream, and (3) predict
    the flow and stage (water-surface elevation) for the stream at a given location
    (AHPS forecast point) throughout the forecast period (every 6 hours and 3 to 5 days
    out in many locations). For more information on AHPS forecasts, please see: http://water.weather.gov/ahps/pcpn_and_river_forecasting.pdf.
