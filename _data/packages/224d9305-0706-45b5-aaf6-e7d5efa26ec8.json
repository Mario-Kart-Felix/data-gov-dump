The compilation of this data is a collaborative effort between the Arkansas Geographic Information Office and the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) to build a comprehensive geographic database of Rural Health Clinics as a component of the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS). The Rural Health Clinics form a sub-component of the existing CDC Bioterrorism plan that involves the visualization application for disease detection and surveillance. A visual aid of health clinic locations overlaid on current digital aerial photography, associated road names, and landmarks, were produced to representatives of ADH to confirm the accuracy of the location.",
