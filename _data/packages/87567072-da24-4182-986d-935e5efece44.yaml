    Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, from 3-5 February 2010, belt transect surveys of coral population
    and diseases quantitative assessments were conducted, as a part of Rapid Ecological
    Assessments (REA), during the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP)
    Cruise HI1001 in the Pacific Remote Island Areas at biennial intervals by the Coral
    Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center
    (PIFSC). During the cruise, there were 8 surveys in total conducted at REA sites
    around Howland Island in the Pacific Remote Island Areas. At the specific REA sites,
    coral biologists along algal biologists and marine invertebrate zoologist entered
    the water and conducted a fine-scale (~300 m2) and high degree of taxonomic resolution
    REA survey to assess and monitor species composition, abundance, percent cover,
    size distribution, diversity, and general health of corals, macro-invertebrates,
    and algae in shallow-water (< 35 m) habitats. As a part of REA surveys, the coral
    belt surveys were focused on quantifying the diversity, abundance, density, and
    size-class distribution of the anthozoan and hydrozoan corals as well as the condition
    and health state of the coral reef populations. The surveys were conducted along
    two consecutively-placed, 25m transect lines. The belt width was 1-m wide, 0.5-m
    on each side of the transect line. Within each 25m transect, five 2.5-meter segments
    were surveyed (beginning at points: 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 meters), whereby in each
    segment, all coral colonies whose center fell within 0.5m of either side of the
    transect line were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible (genus or species)
    and two planar size metrics were collected: maximum diameter and diameter perpendicular
    to the maximum diameter. In addition, the extent of mortality, both recent and old,
    was estimated for each colony. Observers paid special attention to identifying as
    best as possible the extent of the former live colony. When a coral colony exhibited
    signs of disease or compromised health, additional information was recorded including
    type of affliction (bleaching, skeletal growth anomaly, white syndrome, tissue loss
    other than white syndrome, trematodiasis, necrosis, other, pigmentation responses,
    algal overgrowth, and predation), severity of the affliction (mild, moderate, marked,
    severe, acute), as well as photographic documentation and sometimes tissue samples.
    Tissue samples were catalogued and fixed in buffered zinc-formalin solution for
    further histopathological analyses. Raw survey data included species presence and
    relative abundance, colony counts per taxon, size (width and length), mortality,
    predation, and health status. A surveyed area was ranging from 10m2 to 25m2 per
    site.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
