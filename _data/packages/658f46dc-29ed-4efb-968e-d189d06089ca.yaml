    it has unaltered data straight from the satellite. This product can be used to show
    exactly what was recorded by the GMI instrument. The 1AGMI product also contains
    all of the data sent down by the satellite. If there is enough bandwidth, the entire
    circle of GMI samples will be sent down. The 1AGMI product's swaths 4 and 5 contain
    all of the samples that are sent down. Later products only use the subset of these
    data that contains the Earth view, hot load, and cold sky samples.The 1AGMI product
    has two purposes: To repackage the raw satellite data from binary Consultative Committee
    for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) packets to Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), and to
    geolocate the sample data. The counts in the 1AGMI product are the raw counts taken
    directly from the packets created by the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) instrument.
    There is no calibration or interpretation performed at the 1AGMI level. There are
    five swaths in the 1AGMI product: 1. Earth view, hot load, and cold sky samples
    for low-frequency channels. 2. Earth view, hot load, and cold sky samples for high-frequency
    channels. 3. Scan housekeeping data provided by instrument. 4. All samples for low-frequency
    channels. 5. All samples for high-frequency channels. Swaths S1 and S2 are subsets
    of swaths S4 and S5, respectively. The samples to subset are noted in the 1AGMI
    product in the gmi1aHeader/sampleRangeFile table. This is a table determined during
    testing and the Launch and Early Orbit (L&EO) phase of the Global Precipitation
    Measurement (GPM) Mission. Geolocation is performed on the samples using the PPS
    Geolocation Toolkit. The details on GMI geolocation can be found in the GMI Calibration
    Data Book.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
