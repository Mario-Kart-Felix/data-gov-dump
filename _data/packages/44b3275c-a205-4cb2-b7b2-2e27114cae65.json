The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile isn          designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.n          n          School Districts are single-purpose administrative units within which local officials provide public educational services for the area's residents.  Then          Census Bureau obtains the boundaries, names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels for school districts from State officialsn          for the primary purpose of providing the U.S. Department of Education with estimates of the number of children in poverty within each school district.  Thisn          information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to States and school districts.n          n         TIGER/Line Shapefiles include separate shapefiles for elementary, secondary and unified school districts.  The school district boundaries are those in effectn         for the 2011-2012 school year.",
