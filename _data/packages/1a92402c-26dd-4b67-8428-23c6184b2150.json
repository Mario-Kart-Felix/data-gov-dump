	"notes": "tThis Phase II proposal is to develop a miniature, low power consumption, fused deep UV Raman and native fluorescence (DUV-RF) 1 meter stand-off sensor. The proposed instrument has an enhanced ability to measure the spatial distribution of chemical species containing C/N/H/O/S/Cl, and water, ice, and hydrated-minerals on a 1-5 mm spatial scale enabled by a novel wide-aperture, high-sensitivity ultraminiature UV Raman spectrometer. rntRaman spectroscopy is a non-contact, non-destructive, method of identifying unknown materials without sample acquisition or processing; ideal for in-situ rovers. However traditional Raman instruments are plagued with fluorescence backgrounds, require sample altering, high-powered lasers, and require the use fiber optics; an instrument design with operational constraints and high power requirements. Our innovative instrument design incorporates our deep UV lasers for fiberless resonance Raman spectroscopy in a fluorescence free zone where resonance effects lead to enhancements by &gt; 2-3orders of magnitude over 532 and 785 nm systems and can be coupled to native fluorescence for ppt detection of aromatic organics compounds.  rntThe New Frontiers has placed a South pole-Aitken Basin sample return as a future mission scenario. The enhanced detection capabilities of DUV-RF can be used to provide an understanding of organics and water distribution in the lunar regolith. rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
