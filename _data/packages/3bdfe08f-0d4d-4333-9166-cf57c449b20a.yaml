  in this report are as follows: I. This study was conducted to determine the effects
  of consumption of halogenated hydrocarbon compounds, primarily polychlorinated biphenyls
  (PCBs), contained in Great Lakes fish by the domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus).
  In this article we report the results of feeding White Leghorn hens for a period
  of 8 wk diets that contained 31-35% ocean fish and/or carp (Cyprinus carpio) from
  Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, Ml, which provided 0.3 (control), 0.8 (low-dose group),
  or 6.6 (high-dose group) mg PCB/kg, wet weight (ww). These concentrations were analogous
  to 3.3, 26, or 59 pg 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) equivalents (TEQs)/g
  diet, ww, respectively. There were no significant effects on feed consumption among
  the groups. An unexpectedly high incidence of fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS)
  was observed in hens from the control (78% FLHS) and low dose (75% FLHS) groups
  when compared to the high-dose group (15% FLHS). Birds in the control and low-dose
  groups had a significant increase in liver and body weights. Significant decreases
  in egg production, weight, and fertility were immediate in all dose groups, with
  the effect being permanent in the control and low-dose groups. Although the incidence
  of FLHS was an unexpected complication, the fact that there were no significant
  effects on egg production, egg weights, or fertility in the high-dose group suggests
  that the no-observable-adverse-effect concentration (NOAEC) for these parameters
  is in excess of 26 mg total weathered PCBs/kg egg, ww. This value was the average
  concentration of PCBs in the high-dose group eggs during the last week of the study.
  II. Carp from Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, MI, was fed to White Leghorn chickens for
  a period of 8 wk. The diets contained 0.3 (control; 0% carp), 0.8 (3.4% carp), and
  6.6 (35% carp) mg polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)/kg diet, by wet weight (ww).
  These concentrations corresponded to 3.3, 26, and 59 pg 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
  (TCDD) equivalents/g diet ww, respectively. Though the diets were not acutely toxic
  to the adult laying hens, dose- and time-dependent responses were observed in the
  embryos and chicks. Toxicity was manifested as a dose-dependent increase in embryo
  mortality and decreased hatching rates. Furthermore, embryos and chicks displayed
  various deformities, including (1) head and neck edema and hemorrhage, (2) abdominal
  edema and hemorrhage, (3) foot and leg deformities, (4) skull and brain deformities,
  (5) yolk-sac deformities, and (6) miscellaneous deformities. The types of deformities
  observed were similar to those reported for embryos and chicks of colonial waterbirds
  in Saginaw Bay, as well as in controlled studies where technical mixtures or individual
  congeners of polychlonnated diaromatic hydrocarbons (PCDAHs) were fed to chickens.
  Increasing concentrations of carp also significantly affected the various organ
  weights in 18-d embryos and hatched chicks. At 18 d of incubation, weights of the
  embryos' livers were directly proportional to the concentration of PCBs in the diets.
  The weights of the spleens and bursae were inversely proportional to the dietary
  PCB concentration. After 3 additional days of incubation, significant effects in
  body, brain, liver, heart, and bursa weights were observed in hatched chicks. The
  concentrations of total PCBs, as well as 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents (TEQs) in the
  diets, were in the range of those that have been shown to cause similar adverse
  effects in other species. This study has shown that fish, the primary food source
  of colonial waterbirds in Saginaw Bay, are capable of causing adverse reproductive
  effects in a model avian species, the chicken. However, due to differences in the
  relative potency to cause effects on different endpoints in different species, the
  results of this study should not be used to predict the threshold for effects in
  other species.\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"License Not Specified\",\n\t\"extras\":
