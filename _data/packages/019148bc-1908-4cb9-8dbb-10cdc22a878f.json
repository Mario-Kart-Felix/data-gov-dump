	"notes": "The individual software tools that make up the analytical capabilities for the design of entry vehicles using an aero-assist/aero-capture device have been fully developed. In fact the performance of such software against the flight data has been superb, and NASA has used the results to make real-time decisions on the entry vehicles. However, the couplings among such software for estimation of weight and performance has not been developed. In part, the couplings of areas such as the fluid-structure interaction and trajectory still remain undeveloped. Lack of coupling of such software for space application has been the result of the types of structures that have been flown to date, i.e. the entry vehicles have exhibited relatively large stiffness and the TPS has been an integral part of the vehicles. However, when inflatable decelerators are becoming an essential part of the future interplanetary missions, the influence of inflation or structural displacements of an inflatable decelerator on lift and drag should be considered. Furthermore, development of a computational environment that hosts a combination of important disciplines to provide answers in a timely manner should be given a priority. A successful coupling of such software is the essential ingredient for engineering of inflatable decelerators.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
