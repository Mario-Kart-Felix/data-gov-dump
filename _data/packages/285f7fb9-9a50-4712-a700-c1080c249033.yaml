    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "VTHYDRODEM was created to produce a "hydrologically
    correct" DEM, compliant with the Vermont Hydrography Dataset (VHD) in support of
    the "flow regime" project whose goal it is to derive stream perenniality for the
    VHD through application of logistic regression techniques. Some very important notes
    about the data: 1)Produced specifically for hydrologic modeling purposes and elevation
    surface has been altered and should not be used for analyses requiring unmodified
    elevation values; 2) ELEVATION VALUES, i.e., "Z units", are in CENTIMETERS (details
    below); and 3) Source data spans a five year period where varying techniques were
    used. This may explain observed inconsistencies both between and within tiles (detailed
    in the Attribute Accuracy Report below). This dataset has elevation values present
    in the surface that accurately reflect the down gradient nature and location of
    surface water features, i.e. the VHD. This process is also known as "hydro-enforcement"
    or "drainage enforcement". It is largely unknown that the 1:24k scale National
    Elevation Dataset (NED) is not "hydrologically correct" in relation to the National
    Hydrography Dataset (NHD) vector data of the same scale, e.g., the flow paths in
    the NED surface are not perfectly coincident to those in the scale NHD surface water
    features. This fact precluded the use of the NED data for hydrologic modeling efforts
    and reaffirmed the need to create a new "hydrologically correct" DEM. All processing
    was done using ARCINFO workstation (v.8.3) commands. The ARCINFO "TOPOGRID" command
    was used to create VTHYDRODEM as it was specifically designed to create "hydrologically
    correct" digital elevation models (DEM's) from elevation, stream and lake data
    sets. Single line "1D" streams and lake/pond "2D" polygons, from the 1:5k scale
    VHD, were given priority over input elevation data in the interpolation process
    to ensure that the resulting data is "hydrologically correct". Both the VHD and
    VTHYDRODEM share a common base of the state digital orthophotos, ensuring their
    interoperability. The Triangulated Irregular Networks (TIN) method was not considered
    but interested readers should review West Virginia's approach http://www.wvgis.wvu.edu/stateactivities/wvsamb/elevation/topogrid_vs_tin.pdf.
    This report notes the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. It should be
    noted that the WV effort included more recent imagery, and a much tighter sampling
    interval of source data. Nonetheless, it makes a strong case for the TIN approach
    that should be considered in any subsequent DEM development efforts. The density
    of input points used to create VTHYDRODEM was lower than the 1:24k NED but the vertical
    accuracy of those points tested at a higher accuracy and these points were generated
    with less variability in technique than that of the NED (see http://gisdata.usgs.net/website/USGS_GN_NED_DSI/viewer.htm
    and check "production methods" under "Layers" for NED data sources and methods).
    Vertical accuracy was derived using the FGDC National Standards for Spatial Data
    Accuracy (NSSDA) standards. For the sake of comparison, VTHYDRODEM tested at 6.05
    meters, vertical accuracy at the 95% confidence level, whereas, the 1:24k National
    Elevation Dataset (DEM_24) tested at 21.3 meters. VTHYDRODEM was created for a specific,
    in-house project to support hydrologic modeling activities using the 1:5k scale
    VHD. It was interpolated from: 1) the Vermont Mapping Program (VMP) "x, y, z"
    data known as the "DEM points" (originally used to georectify the state digital
    orthophotos); and 2) VHD surface water features. A 10-meter cell resolution was
    chosen for VTHYDRODEM as a balance between input data accuracy and practical considerations
    and does not necessarily reflect the accuracy of the input data. The 10-meter resolution
    of this dataset was chosen arbitrarily for reasons noted below and should not be
    confused with an accuracy of 10 meters. This data should not be confused with the
    "1/3 arc second" 10m NED data. The lower 10m cell resolution has the following
    advantages when compared to the existing 30m 1:24k NED: 1) Stream confluences (junctions)
    can be defined with a greater degree of precision; 2) Confluences in close proximity
    can be represented individually; 3) Smaller landscape features can be represented
    and larger ones in greater detail; 4) Exponential improvement in volumetric measurement
    and tripling of precision in linear measurement of derived vector features, e.g.,
    a watershed boundary is composed of aggregated 10m, i.e., 3 cells equals 30m vs.
    30m resolution where 3 cells equals 90m. Similarly the concept applies to volumetric
    measurements); and 5) Improved cartographic accuracy for derived vector features.
    NOTE! Elevation units, e.g., "Z units" are in CENTIMETERS. This seeming arbitrary
    decision has a number of advantages worth considering. The output grid can now be
    stored as an "integer" type grid while simultaneously preserving the precision
    of the input data to the nearest centimeter. Integer type grids require one-tenth
    the storage space and are consequently much faster to process, e.g., deriving watershed
    boundaries. While it is unlikely that the input data is accurate to the nearest
    centimeter, this approach allows for greater precision storage, improves the overall
    appearance of the DEM and precludes problems with the model's depiction of over
    land flow in hydrologic related analyses when compared to coarser vertical resolutions.
    This approach mirrors a trend among the USGS and its contractors, who are now producing
    DEM's with a vertical resolution of decimeters (0.1 meter) for the benefits outlined
    above.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key": "bbox-east-long",ntt"value":
