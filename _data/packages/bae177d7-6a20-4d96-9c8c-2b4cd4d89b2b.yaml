    and proportional contribution of main species to canopy cover were measured at 60
    sampling points at 50 m intervals along six transects in the vicinity of the MODIS
    validation site tower in Kataba Forest, near Mongu, Zambia, in late February to
    early March 2000 as part of the SAFARI 2000 Wet Season Campaign. The aim of the
    study was to provide a broad description of the tree canopy layer around the tower.Tree
    and shrub species composition was recorded for each grid and measurements of canopy
    cover (% and rank) and frequency of occurrence (%) were made. Basal area was estimated
    at each grid site in a single 360 degree sweep using a basal area prism. Four estimates
    of canopy cover, oriented north, south, east, and west around the sample point,
    were taken at each grid site using a spherical densiometer and the data were averaged
    to give a single value for each grid. Only the canopies of trees and shrubs above
    1.5 m height were measured.The data are stored in an ASCII file, in csv format.
    The file lists all tree and shrub species recorded and provides the proportional
    contribution of these species to canopy cover in each grid. Total tree basal area
    (m2 ha-1) and overall tree canopy cover (%) in each grid is also provided. The companion
    file provides additional vegetation data, graphics, long-term meteorological data,
    a discussion of the study results, and photographs of the study site.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
