	"notes": "NASA is seeking innovative spatial and visual methods for search analysis and display of scientific data, to aid outreaching of this data to the interested mass-users. To address this need, AGNC proposes to develop innovative Attribute Image Map Fused 3D Web-Objects (AIMFO-3DWO) technology and software toolsets, based principally on new organization of geospatial datasets that integrates topographical maps, attributive information, remotely sensed imagery and DEM into one unified data aggregate and format. The AIMFO-3DWO will bring together a fully functional Web-GIS, relational database management system (RDBMS) and image processing tool with new means of data management and manipulation, based on singular software toolset including super-compact data format that will be very effective in fused datasets distribution over networks and will make it possible to deploy PDA and even mobile phone clients.rnThe AIMFO-3DWO will be operated by XML/GML compatible non-schema non-SQL mass-user oriented man-machine interface. The AIMFO-3DWO for the first time provides rapid network access to geospatial datasets by means of unique Geospatial Image Language and interoperable system architecture.rnPhase I is devoted to the AIMFO-3DWO proof-of-concept. Phase II will result in development of a fully functional AIMFO-3DWO system. ",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
