    surface (incorporated into the las format as intensity) for an area of shallow seabed:
    1. Surrounding St. Thomas and St. John (STT/STJ): 3m x 3m grid 2. Mouth of Salt
    River Bay (SARI) in St. Croix: 5m x 5m grid 3. Buck Island Reef National Monument
    (BUIS) in St. Croix: 3m x 3m grid Fugro LADS, in collaboration with NOAA's National
    Ocean Service (NOS), National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS), Center
    for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment (CCMA), Biogeography Branch, the University
    of New Hampshire and the National Park Service, acquired bathymetry, relative seafloor
    reflectivity and hyperspectral imagery in St. Thomas and St. John on thirteen separate
    dates between 1/29/2011 to 2/28/2011 and in St. Croix (SARI and BUIS) on 2/21/2011
    and 2/22/2011. 1. STT/STJ Hyperspectral data were acquired using a Hyspex VNIR-1600
    sensor. Bathymetry and reflectivity data were acquired using a LADS (Laser Airborne
    Depth Sounder) Mark II Airborne System from altitudes between 1,200 and 2,200ft
    at ground speeds between 140 and 210 knots. The 900 Hertz Nd: YAG (neodymium-doped
    yttrium aluminum garnet) laser (1064 nm) acquired 3x3 meter spot spacing and 200%
    seabed coverage. For STT/STJ, 168.1 square kilometers of LiDAR were collected between
    0 m and 40 m in depth. Data was flown for charting. This data met IHO Order 1 standards.
    2. SARI Hyperspectral data were acquired using a Hyspex VNIR-1600 sensor. Bathymetry
    and reflectivity data were acquired using a LADS (Laser Airborne Depth Sounder)
    Mark II Airborne System from altitudes between 1,200 and 2,200ft at ground speeds
    between 140 and 175 knots. The 900 Hertz Nd: YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum
    garnet) laser (1064 nm) acquired 5x5 meter spot spacing and 200% seabed coverage.
    For SARI, 1.62 square kilometers of LiDAR were collected between 0 m and 34 m in
    depth. This data was collected for research, not charting. It was collected using
    the same acquistion parameters as STT/STJ, but its uncertainties were not quantified.
    As such, it is not known if this data meets IHO Order 1 standards. 3. BUIS Hyperspectral
    data were acquired using a Hyspex VNIR-1600 sensor. Bathymetry and reflectivity
    data were acquired using a LADS (Laser Airborne Depth Sounder) Mark II Airborne
    System from altitudes between 1,200 and 2,200ft at ground speeds between 140 and
    175 knots. The 900 Hertz Nd: YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet) laser
    (1064 nm) acquired 3x3 meter spot spacing and 200% seabed coverage. For BUIS, 35.9
    square kilometers of LiDAR were collected between 0 m and 49 m in depth. This data
    was collected for research, not charting. It was collected using the same acquistion
    parameters as STT/STJ, but its uncertainties were not quantified. As such, it is
    not known if this data meets IHO Order 1 standards. The data received from NCCOS
    were in GEOTIFF format for both the lidar and seafloor reflectivity. The NOAA Office
    for Coastal Management converted these two data sets to text format and then combined
    them into one text file based on x and y. The text file was then converted to las
    format, where the seafloor reflectivity is represented as intensity. The data's
    horizontal coordinate system was NAD83 UTM 20 North, and depth values were collected
    in meters referenced to Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) depths. Upon receipt of the
    data, the NOAA Office for Coastal Management converted the data to geographic coordinates
    and ellipsoid heights for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes.
    Environmental factors such as wind strength and direction, cloud cover, water clarity
    and depth influenced the area of data acquisition on a daily basis. The data was
    processed using the LADS Mark II Ground System and data visualization, quality control
    and final products were created using CARIS HIPS and SIPS and CARIS BASE Editor.

    their own needs and standards.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
