    and contamination from previous activities on the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National
    Wildlife Refuge. In April 2013, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service initiated a formal
    process to remove/modify a CERCLA land use restriction to allow the refuge to manage
    its bison herd similar to other bison herds across the country, which would include
    removing surplus bison from the site. Bison were sampled for organochlorine pesticides
    and mercury. The Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge was created from
    a former Department of Defense installation. There is a well-documented history
    of disturbance and contamination from previous activities on this site. In April
    2013, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service initiated a formal process to remove/modify
    a CERCLA land use restriction to allow the refuge to manage its bison herd similar
    to other bison herds across the country, which would include removing surplus bison
    from the site. To remove/ modify this restriction, defensible data is needed to
    support a risk determination demonstrating that there is not an unacceptable risk
    from consumption of refuge bison. Sample design was based on the pharmocokinetics
    of organochlorine pesticdes, especially dieldrin. Samples were collected from both
    sexes and a wide range of ages. All animals tested were born or have spent the majority
    of their lives on the Refuge. A goal was to create a method to sampe bison tissue
    from live animals. Such a method would provide a relatively cost-effective surveillance
    technique to allow detection of any contaminants without sacrificing animals. In
    addition, a set of samples was provided to the USDA Food Inspection Service for
    testing under their methods.In 2014 and 2015, 112 tissue samples collected from
    necropsies were analyzed to support risk-based site-specific assessment. Only one
    sample yielded a dieldrin detection. Dieldrin is known to accumulate in fat tissue
    and this detection (21 ppb) was found in tail-head fat tissue. This detection in
    fat and not in other tissues within the animal further confirms the lipophilic nature
    of these chemicals. Even with the reported dieldrin concentrations in fat in this
    single detection, bison meat samples have very low fat content (2%), so the dieldrin
    concentrations in meat from this animal were well below site-specific screening
    levels for organochlorine pesticide residues. This result is also consistent with
    the USDA analysis, although the USDA detection levels were not as low as for this
    study.Inorganic mercury is known to accumulate in kidneys. A total of 10 animals
    had low mercury concentrations (0.02 u2013 0.03 mg/kg) in kidney. These low levels
    of mercury are consistent with the low soil concentrations of mercury in RMA surface
    soils and with what is known about demethylation in the digestive organs of ungulates.
    In addition, inorganic mercury is poorly absorbed from plants so it is rarely detected
    in meat. The EPA has adopted a standard for methylmercury in fish (30 ppb) as well
    as a FDA action level (1.0 ppm). No standards exist for inorganic mercury in terrestrial
    biota.It appears current bison grazing activities on the Rocky Mountain Arsenal
    National Wildlife Refuge do not result in animals encountering contaminants that
    could present any risk to humans through direct consumption. Analysis of samples
    collected from multiple tissues and organs during the necropsy of eighteen animals
    reaffirms past studies demonstrating that even extremely low levels of contaminants
    are not present in potentially edible tissue. This information can be utilized to
    complete required data summary and evaluation reports to support a change in the
    CERCLA land use restriction affecting possible consumption of refuge bison. Data
    may also be used in combination with existing information on the site to support:
    (1) elimination of further sampling for mercury in bison; and (2) the decision to
    proceed with a surveillance program as bison experien",nt"license_title": "License
