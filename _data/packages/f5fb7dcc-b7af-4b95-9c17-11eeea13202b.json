	"notes": "slowed rotor / compound (SL/C) aircraft offer VTOL combined withnfixed-wing flight-efficiencies.  They are safer than any other typenaircraft -- with much lower acquisition, maintenance and operationalncost than helicopters and tiltrotors.  Carter Aviation Technologiesnbegan developing SL/C aircraft in 1994 and began flying a prototype, thenCarterCopter Technology Demonstrator (CCTD) in 1998.  This proposal,nusing CCTD data, will provide a prototype 2-seat SR/C, VTOL aircraftnthat meets NASA?s PAVE goals.  Reduced community noise is provided by ancomputerized propeller, designed for quietness, which operates at lowntip-speeds and is protected by tail-booms.  The non-stallingnautorotating rotor provides low tip-speeds, eliminates the helicoptern?dead man zone? and provides the equivalent of an emergency parachute.nLow cost per seat mile is provided by simplified construction, reducednparts count and high flight-efficiency.  During VTOL and low-speednflight, SR/C aircraft fly like an autogyro having the same hp to weightnratio.  Autogyros are the easiest aircraft to learn to fly safely.nPilot workload is simplified by an automated tilting pylon that keepsnthe wings in best L/D, an automated boosted collective and automatednrotor flapping controls.  The landing gear absorbs 24 ft/sec impacts.nOnly the tilting pylon is untested.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
