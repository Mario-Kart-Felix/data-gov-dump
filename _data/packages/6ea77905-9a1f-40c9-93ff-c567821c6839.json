Although one of the guiding principles of the NLCD 2001 design was to maintain as much compatibility with NLCD 1992 as possible, there were enough differences in the classifications to confound any direct comparison of the two datasets. Taking into consideration inherent differences in source image seasonality and georegistration, mapping methodologies, classification accuracy, and map legends, it became clear that a direct post classification comparison of NLCD 1992 and NLCD 2001 would be subject to unavoidable error.",
