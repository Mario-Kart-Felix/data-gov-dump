    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The primary objective of algorithm 3A25
    is to compute various rainfall statistics over a month from the level 2 PR products.
     The statistics are derived at two spatial resolutions: (1) a standard space scale
    of 5 degrees by 5 degrees (latitude x longitude) cells and (2) a high resolution
    subset of 0.5 degree x 0.5 degree cells.nnThe output variables include rainfall
    rate (mm/hour) profile at 2, 4, 6, 10, and 15 km, fractional rain, snow ice layer,
    and surface rain rate (mm/hour). The output statistics include probabilities of
    occurrence, means and standard deviations, histograms, and correlation coefficients.nnAll
    statistics in 3A-25, except near-surface rain rate, are computed only when rain
    is judged in 1C-21 to be "certain." When rain is judged in 1C-21 to be "possible,"
    the observation is treated as a "no-rain" observation. For the near-surface rain
    rate, the statistics (mean, standard deviation, and histogram) are computed for
    "rain-possible" as for the usual "rain-certain." Because the "rain-possible"
    cases are dominated by noise so that the probability of false-alarm is high, the
    "rain-certain" statistics should be considered as more representative of the TRMM
    radar data.nnThree types of rain rates are defined in 3A-25: (1) a "near-surface"
    rain rate that is obtained from the range bin closest to the surface which is not
    corrupted by the surface clutter, (2) a path-averaged rain rate calculated by summing
    the values from the storm top (first gate where rain is detected) to the last gate
    (gate nearest to the surface uncontaminated by surface clutter) and dividing by
    the number of gates in the interval, and (3) those at fixed heights above the ellipsoid
    (2, 4, 6, 10, and 15 km).nnSpatial coverage is between 40 degrees North and 40 degrees
    South, owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite.nnThe data are stored
    in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF). The low resolution grids are in the Planetary
    Grid 1 structure, and the high resolution grids are in the Planetary Grid 2 structure.
    The file size (one file per month) is about 16 MB (uncompressed). The description
    of file component objects can be obtained from Volume 4 - Levels 2 and 3 File Specifications
    provided by the TRMM Science Data and Information System (TSDIS): "http://pps.gsfc.nasa.gov/".nnThe
    Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japan satellite mission
    to monitor tropical and subtropical precipitation and to estimate its associated
    latent heating. TRMM was successfully launched on November 27, at 4:27 PM (EST)
    from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan.nnThe TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR),
    the first of its kind in space, is an electronically scanning radar, operating at
    13.8 GHz that measures the 3-D rainfall distribution over both land and ocean, and
    defines the layer depth of the precipitation.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
