	"notes": "Padilla Bay is a tidal estuary in Puget Sound, Washington with extensive eelgrass beds and mudflats. The estuary is an important natural resource which provides habitat for a wealth of wildlife and aquatic life, including species of high economic value such as salmon and dungeness crab. Potential contaminant threats to Padilla Bay include spills and emissions from two large oil refineries, runoff from agricultural lands, and active and inactive landfills. The purposes of this study were to document existing contaminant concerns, and provide background information on contaminant levels in the event of an oil spill. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service collected sediment, bivalves, and eelgrass samples from several sites throughout Padilla and Fidalgo Bays during the summer of 1988. Samples were analyzed for trace elements, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), aliphatic hydrocarbons (AH), and organochlorine (OC) pesticides. Overall, the results from this study indicated that the occurrences of elevated contaminant residues in Padilla Bay were few and localized. Statistical analyses were not conducted due to the limited number of samples. Nickel in sediment exceeded biological effect levels at about half of the sites. Sites where nickel exceeded these levels occurred throughout the study area. Eight of the nine PAHs with identified biological effect levels were exceeded in a single sediment sample from the mouth of Joe Leary Slough. Chromium effect levels were exceeded in sediment from one site (Guemes Island), and zinc concentrations exceeded effect levels at two sites (No Name Slough, Little Indian Slough). Total AHs were found to be elevated in sediments at the mouth of Telegraph Slough. Cadmium and chromium residues in littleneck clams, and arsenic residues in eelgrass were higher at the site closest to the March Point Landfill. Metal residues in softshell clams and PAH residues in both eelgrass and softshell clams were generally highest at the sites (MP3, FB4). These two sites were closest to the piers and pipelines used to transfer crude oil from tankers to the refineries on March Point and to associated discharge outfalls. These results are consistent with the shipping and industrial activity in the area. The contaminant residues measured in biota were not present at levels indicating a need for remediation. Recommendations included: identify and examine the potential sources and the extent of nickel contamination in sediments throughout the study area; examine the extent of PAH contamination of sediments at Joe Leary Slough; and, conduct further remediation on March Point Landfill to control the discharge source of contaminants.",
