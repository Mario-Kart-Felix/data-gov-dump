	"notes": "The AquaScan, a miniaturized UV/VIS/NIR hyperspectral imager will be built for deployment on a UAV or small manned aircraft for ocean coastal remote sensing applications.  The hyperspectral system includes a data acquisition system with remote operation capability proving a real-time waterfall display of the hyperspectral scans.  OKSI teamed with Scripps Institution of Oceanography to define and design a sensor that explicitly meets the performance requirements needed for ocean remote sensing of coastal regions, but can also be used for terrestrial remote sensing.  Specifically, some key requirements called for: 1) high spatial resolution (&lt; 1 meter), 2) high spectral resolution (&lt; 10 nm), UV  NIR coverage (300  1000 nm), 4) high sensitivity for low reflectivity of ocean surfaces, 5) provide simultaneous downwelling solar radiation measurements, and 6) allow for operating mode that avoids specular reflections off ocean surface.  rnThe AquaScan design was completed during the Phase I effort.  During Phase II the sensor will be manufactured, tested, calibrated, and prepared for flight testing.  The system will then be demonstrated during several airborne tests off the Southern California coast.  The tests will include measurements of spatially/spectrally unique ocean phenomena including red tide blooms and river plume run-offs after heavy rain storms.  Coordinated ship-based remote sensing and in situ measurements will take place concurrently with the newly developed miniature UV/VIS/NIR airborne measurements. The ship-based measurements will serve as ground truth for validation/verification.  In addition, OKSI will attempt to coordinate data collections with satellite passes (e.g., MODIS, MERIS, SeaWiFS).  Comparison with satellite data will serve as validation and demonstration of the capability to support future satellite programs (e.g., GEO-CAPE).rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
