The compilation of this data is a collaborative effort between the Arkansas Geographic Information Office and the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) to build a comprehensive geographic database of heliports as a component of the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS). The heliports form a sub-component of the existing CDC Bioterrorism plan that involves the visualization application for disease detection and surveillance. A visual aid of heliport locations overlaid on current digital aerial photography, associated road names, and landmarks, were produced and provided to the local field representatives to confirm the accuracy of the location.",
