  files (.dbf) are an extract of selectedn          geographic and cartographic information
  from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
  Encoding and Referencingn          (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents
  a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line
  shapefile isn          designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they
  can be combined to cover the entire nation.n           n          A tribal block
  group is a cluster of census tabulation blocks within a single tribal census tract
  delineated by American Indian tribal participants or then          Census Bureau
  for the purpose of presenting demographic data on their reservation and/or off-reservation
  trust land.  The tribal block groups are definedn          independently of the
  standard county-based block group delineation.  For federally recognized American
  Indian Tribes with reservations and/or off-reservationn          trust lands with
  a population less than 1,200, a single tribal block group is defined.  Qualifying
  reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands with an          population greater
  than 1,200 could define additional tribal block groups within their area without
  regard to the standard block group configuration.  Tribaln          block groups
  do not necessarily contain tabulation blocks always beginning with the same number
  and could contain seemingly duplicate block numbers.n          Tabulation block
  numbers are still assigned by using standard block groups, not the tribal block
  groups.  To better identify tribal block groups, the lettern          code range
  A through K (except I, which could be confused with a number 1) is used uniquely
  within each tribal census tract.n          n          The boundaries of tribal block
  groups and tribal census tracts are those delineated through the Tribal Statistical
  Areas Program (TSAP) for the 2010 Census.n        \",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\":
