	"notes": "Recent studies have demonstrated that of various fish feeds contain significant concentrations of contaminants, many of which can bioaccumulate and bioconcentrate in fish. It appears that numerous organchlorine (OC) contaminants present in fish oils and fish meals used in feed manufacture, and some researchers speculate that all fish feeds contain measurable levels of some contaminants. To determine the presence and concentration of contaminants in feeds used in National Fish Hatcheries managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, we systematically collected samples of 11 hatcheries that raise cold-water species and analyzed them for suite of chemical contaminants. All of the samples (collected from October 2001 to October 2003) contained measurable concentrations of at least one dioxin, furan, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congener, or dichlorodiphenylthrichloroethane (DDT) metabolite. All samples which were assayed, 24 of 55 contained furans and 24 of 55 samples contained DDT or its metabolites. There were 10- to 150-fold differences in the range in concentrations of the additive totals for PCB's, dioxins, furans, and DDT. Although PCBs were the most commonly detected contaminant in our study (all samples in which it was assayed), the concentrations (range: 0.07 to 10.46 ng g-1 wet weight) were low compared to those reported previously. In general, we also found lower levels of organochlorine contaminants than have been reported previously in fish feed. Perhaps most notable is the near absence of OC pesticides-except for DDT (and its metabolites) and just two samples containing benzene hexachloride (Lindane). While contaminant concentrations were generally low, the ecological impacts cannot be determined without a measure of the bioaccumulation of these compounds in the fish and the fate of these compounds after the fish are released from the hatcheries.",
