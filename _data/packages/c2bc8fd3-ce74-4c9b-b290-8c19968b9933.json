	"notes": "Chronos Technology (the R&amp;D division of Frequency Management International, FMI) proposes to deliver a comprehensive, and fully investigated &amp; validated feasibility study (in Phase 1) for a novel approach leading to design &amp; fabrication of extreme Environment Silicon Carbide (SiC) circuit blocks  used in a variety of spacecraft power &amp; propulsion system. The circuits shall be used for a wide range of both manned and unmanned space missions. The resulting solutions uniquely enable new extreme environment and high temperature performance levels offered commercially in compact, miniature size &amp; rugged construction. There are no present alternatives for the proposed devices applicable to the extreme environment operating conditions. Based on the technology selection investigation and the road map defined, our proposed technology investigation and the resulting design effort in phase 1 shall conclude with identifying the best fit semiconductor fabrication process as well as component level design &amp; implementation/fabrication methodology plan. With the already stated interest from SiC processing companies such as Cree, we would be focused on targeting device designs for circuits like counter, basic gate, buffer/driver &amp; amplifier, all operating at industry std low voltages rnIn phase 2, we will complete the design/fabrication of successful extreme environment integrated circuit blocks as described that will be used in high efficiency spacecraft power &amp; propulsion systems. We envision to deliver devices that will enable high efficiency power management as well as much improvement in energy density and specific power as required for the state of the art modular power unit architecture. Coupled with the extreme environment, high temperature operation and radiation hardened capabilities the resulting innovative devices will play its significant role as part of the emerging power and propulsion system for future missions.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
