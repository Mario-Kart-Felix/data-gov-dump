    topography in Northeast Puerto Rico derived from a bathymetry model with a principle
    component analysis (PCA). The area covered includes the shallow water area (0-60m
    deep) of the Northeast Ecological Reserves: including the waters off of Fajardo
    and Luqillo, to the Former Roosevelt Roads Navy Base, the Vieques Sound, La Cordillera
    Reserve, the Luis Pena Reserve, and the waters around Culebra Island. The PCA image
    was created using Envi 5.1, and is based on nine morphometric derivatives of the
    bathymetry, such as slope, curvature and rugosity. The bathymetry model was created
    by integrating soundings from several different sources (1900-2013), including high
    resolution coastal LiDAR, NOAA Single-beam and multibeam bathymetry, and historical
    lead line soundings, into a multi resolution (4m, 20m, 100m) depth model. The PCA
    image was used to delineate the different shallow water benthic habitats of NEPR.",nt"owner_org":
