	"notes": "The proposed research program aims at developing a variable-fidelitynsoftware tool set for aeroservothermoelastic-propulsive (ASTE-P)nmodeling that can be routinely applied to the design of aerospacenvehicles. The tool set can be applied to conventional vehicle types asnwell as hypersonic vehicles. The major issues involved in ASTE-Pnmodeling and simulation will be significantly and extensivelyninvestigated in this project, which include full coupling betweennfluid/structure/control dynamics, the aeroservothermoelastic-propulsiveninstability, the viscous/turbulent effects, shock and shock-boundarynlayer interaction, as well as the large unsteady and highly nonlinearnaerothermal dynamic loading on structure of vehicles. The interface ofnthe structure/control surface dynamic vibration modes with flows will benmodeled using particle-based material point method (MPM) in annintegrated dynamic fluid-structure interaction environment.  The MPM isnessentially a particle-based method which avoids dealing with thentime-varying mesh distortions and boundary variations due tonstructure/control surface deformations and/or motions (i.e. wingnflutters, FCS/structural mode interaction, PSD turbulence response),nthus being significantly more robust and computationally efficient thannthe traditional finite element methods that must utilize moving-boundarynand mesh-regeneration. Phase I will build and demonstrate the initialncapability; the end software in Phase II will be fully capable of ASTE-Pnanalysis and evaluation for aerospace vehicles.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
