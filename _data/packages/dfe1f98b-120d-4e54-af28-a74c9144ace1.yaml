  related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic
  information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated
  Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents
  a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line
  File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined
  to cover the entire nation. The primary legal divisions of most States are termed
  counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which
  has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs,
  and municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated
  cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.
  In four States (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more
  incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute
  primary divisions of their States. These incorporated places are known as independent
  cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation.
  The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered
  an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats
  the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation:
  Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities
  in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin
  Islands. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas
  is covered by counties or equivalent entities. The 2010 Census boundaries for counties
  and equivalent entities are as of January 1, 2010, primarily as reported through
  the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).<br /><br /> This table
  contains data on household income and poverty status from the American Community
  Survey 2006-2010 database for counties. The American Community Survey (ACS) is a
  household survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that currently has an annual
  sample size of about 3.5 million addresses. ACS estimates provides communities with
  the current information they need to plan investments and services. Information
  from the survey generates estimates that help determine how more than $400 billion
  in federal and state funds are distributed annually. Each year the survey produces
  data that cover the periods of 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year estimates for geographic
  areas in the United States and Puerto Rico, ranging from neighborhoods to Congressional
  districts to the entire nation. This table also has a companion table (Same table
  name with MOE Suffix) with the margin of error (MOE) values for each estimated element.
  MOE is expressed as a measure value for each estimated element. So a value of 25
  and an MOE of 5 means 25 +/- 5 (or statistical certainty between 20 and 30). There
  are also special cases of MOE. An MOE of -1 means the associated estimates do not
  have a measured error. An MOE of 0 means that error calculation is not appropriate
  for the associated value. An MOE of 109 is set whenever an estimate value is 0.
  The MOEs of aggregated elements and percentages must be calculated. This process
  means using standard error calculations as described in \"American Community Survey
  Multiyear Accuracy of the Data (3-year 2008-2010 and 5-year 2006-2010)\". Also,
  following Census guidelines, aggregated MOEs do not use more than 1 0-element MOE
  (109) to prevent over estimation of the error. Due to the complexity of the calculations,
  some percentage MOEs cannot be calculated (these are set to null in the summary-level
  MOE tables).<br /><br /> The name for table 'ACS10INCCNTYMOE' was added as a prefix
  to all field names imported from that table. Be sure to turn off 'Show Field Aliases'
  to see complete field names in the Attribute Table of this feature layer. This can
  be done in the 'Table Options' drop-down menu in the Attribute Table or with key
  sequence '[CTRL]+[SHIFT]+N'. Due to database restrictions, the prefix may have been
  abbreviated if the field name exceded the maximum allowed characters.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
