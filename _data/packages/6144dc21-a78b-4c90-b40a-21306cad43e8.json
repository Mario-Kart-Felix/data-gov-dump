	"notes": "The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japann                              satellite mission to monitor tropical and subtropical precipitationn                              and to estimate its associated latent heating. TRMM was successfullyn                              launched on November 27, at 4:27 PM (EST) from the Tanegashima Spacen                              Center in Japan.n                              n                              The Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) is a five-channeln                              visible/infrared radiometer, which builds on the heritage of then                              Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument flownn                              aboard the NOAA series of Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmentaln                              Satellites (POES). The VIRS detects radiation at 1 visible, 2 nearn                              infrared and 2 thermal infrared wavelengths, allowing determination ofn                              cloud coverage, cloud top height and temperature, and precipitationn                              indices. The central wavelengths for the VIRS channels are 0.63, 1.60,n                              3.75, 10.8, and 12.0 microns. All channels are in operation during then                              daytime, but only channels 3, 4 and 5 operate during the nighttime.n                              n                              The Level 1A product file (1A01) is a concatenation of the Level 0n                              data with a header record and, as such, is reversible to Level 0. Then                              header record contains information pertaining to orbit times, orbitn                              number, times of the first scan, and number of scans, among othern                              things. The Level 0 data contain the actual channel data expressed asn                              "sensor counts". A Level 1A file contains data for a single orbit andn                              has a file size of about 31 MB (uncompressed).  There are 16 filesn                              of VIRS 1A01 data produced per day.n                              n                              Spatial coverage is between 38 degrees North and 38 degrees Southn                              owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite. This orbitn                              provides extensive coverage in the tropics and allows each location ton                              be covered at a different local time each day, enabling the analysisn                              of the diurnal cycle of precipitation.",

What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
