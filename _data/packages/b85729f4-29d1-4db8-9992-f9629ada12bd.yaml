    has become a significant energy source in the Powder River Basin of northeastern
    Wyoming. In Wyoming, coalbed methane (CBM) gas is extracted by drilling wells into
    coal seams and removing water to release the gas. Each CBM well produces an average
    of 10 gallons per minute (gpm) of water and a maximum of 100 gpm. Disposal of CBM
    produced water is accomplished by direct discharge to surface drainages, and also
    by a variety of other treatment and disposal methods. Untreated CBM produced water
    discharged to surface drainages is the primary method of disposal provided that
    the CBM produced water meets Wyoming water quality standards. Water failing to meet
    water quality standards cannot legally be discharged into surface drainages and
    is alternately discharged into closed containment ponds for soil-ground water infiltration
    and evaporation. In 2000 and 2001, we collected and analyzed water from CBM discharges
    and receiving waters and sediment and biota from CBM produced water impoundments.
    In 2002, we collected and analyzed water from CBM closed containment impoundments.
    All the samples were analyzed for trace elements. The biota included pondweed (Potamogeton
    vaginatus), aquatic invertebrates, fish, and tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum).
    One CBM produced water discharge exceeded the chronic criterion for iron and several
    CBM produced water discharges exceeded the acute criterion for copper. Terminal
    sinks receiving CBM produced water have the potential for the eventual increase
    in trace element concentrations in water, sediment and wildlife dietary items such
    as pondweed and aquatic invertebrates. Waterborne copper, iron, lead, and manganese
    exceeded chronic criteria in several impoundments receiving CBM produced water.
    Arsenic, cadmium, nickel, and zinc in sediments from a terminal sink receiving CBM
    produced water exceeded the threshold effects concentrations for sediment-dwelling
    organisms. Cadmium and chromium in aquatic invertebrates and pondweed, respectively,
    from terminal sink sites were elevated. Waterborne selenium concentrations in six
    of the seven closed containment impoundments and all seven associated CBM discharges
    ranged from 2.2 to 8.4 :g/L, exceeding the 2 :g/L threshold for bioaccumulation
    in sensitive species of fish and aquatic birds. Closed containment ponds containing
    high selenium water may present a risk to aquatic birds using these ponds if the
    ponds provide a dietary route of exposure through submerged aquatic vegetation or
    aquatic invertebrates. CBM operators, land managers, and landowners should evaluate
    the disposal options for CBM produced water on a site by site basis to prevent adverse
    impacts on soils, groundwater, and surface water as well as fish and wildlife and
    their habitats.",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras":
