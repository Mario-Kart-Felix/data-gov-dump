  Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
  reef ecosystems, from 20120227 to 20120325, belt transect surveys of coral population
  and diseases quantitative assessments were conducted, as a part of Rapid Ecological
  Assessments (REA), during the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP)
  cruise HA1201 in Pacific Remote Island Areas at periodic intervals between one and
  three years by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands
  Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). During the cruise, there were 10 surveys in total
  conducted at REA sites around Johnston. At the specific REA sites, coral biologists
  along with algal biologists and marine invertebrate zoologist entered the water
  and conducted a fine-scale (approximately 300 m^2) and high degree of taxonomic
  resolution REA survey to assess and monitor species composition, abundance, percent
  cover, size distribution, diversity, and general health of corals, macro-invertebrates,
  and algae in shallow-water (less than 35 m) habitats. As a part of REA surveys,
  the coral belt surveys were focused on quantifying the diversity, abundance, density,
  and size-class distribution of the anthozoan and hydrozoan corals as well as the
  condition and health state of the coral reef populations. The surveys were conducted
  along two consecutively-placed, 25 m transect lines. The belt width was 1 m wide,
  0.5 m on each side of the transect line. Within each 25 m transect, five 2.5 m segments
  were surveyed (beginning at points: 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 meters), whereby in each
  segment, all coral colonies whose center fell within 0.5 m of either side of the
  transect line were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible (genus or species)
  and two planar size metrics were collected: maximum diameter and diameter perpendicular
  to the maximum diameter. In addition, the extent of mortality, both recent and old,
  was estimated for each colony. Observers paid special attention to identifying as
  best as possible the extent of the former live colony. When a coral colony exhibited
  signs of disease or compromised health, additional information was recorded including
  type of affliction (bleaching, skeletal growth anomaly, white syndrome, tissue loss
  other than white syndrome, trematodiasis, necrosis, other, pigmentation responses,
  algal overgrowth, and predation), severity of the affliction (mild, moderate, marked,
  severe, acute), as well as photographic documentation and occasional tissue samples.
  Tissue samples were cataloged and fixed in buffered zinc-formalin solution for further
  histopathological analyses. Raw survey data included species presence and relative
  abundance, colony counts per taxon, size (width and length), mortality, predation,
  and health status. A surveyed area was ranging from 10 m^2 to 25 m^2 per site.\",\n\t\"owner_org\":
