The MTDB representsn               a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent datan               set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. American Indian tribal subdivisions are administrative subdivisions of federally recognizedn               American Indian reservations / off-reservation trust lands or Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs). These entities are internal units ofn               self-government and/or administration that serve social, cultural, and/or economic purposes for the American Indian Tribe or Tribes on the reservationsn               / off-reservation trust lands or OTSAs. The Census Bureau obtains the boundary and attribute information for tribal subdivisions on federally recognizedn               American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands from federally recognized tribal governments through the Census Bureau's Boundary andn               Annexation Survey (BAS). For the 2010 Census, the boundaries for tribal subdivisions on OTSAs were also obtained from federally recognized tribaln               governments through the Tribal Statistical Areas Program (TSAP). Note that tribal subdivisions do not exist on all reservations / off-reservation trustn               lands or OTSAs, rather only where they were submitted to the Census Bureau by the federally recognized tribal government for that area.n            ",
