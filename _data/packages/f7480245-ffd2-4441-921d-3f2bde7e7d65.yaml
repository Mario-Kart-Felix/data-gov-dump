  1 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of the south shore of St. John, US
  Virgin Islands. Due to the large file size of the St. John project area, it was
  divided into four component grids for improved manageability, named STJ_1m_grid1,
  STJ_1m_grid2, STJ_1m_grid3, and STJ_1m_grid4 from west to east.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA
  Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel, in collaboration with NOAA vessel
  Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam
  bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired
  with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed
  by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied
  (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using
  final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84.
  The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath
  angle with footprint size 3*3. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface
  and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool
  'Feature to Raster', with cell size 1, was used to generate the final ESRI Geotiff.
  While the project was conducted to meet IHO Order 2 accuracy standards, there is
  a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in the dataset that the user should take into
  consideration when performing any analysis.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819\",\n\t\"extras\":
