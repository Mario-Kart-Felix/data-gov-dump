  backscatter mosaic of the moderate-depth portion of the NPS's Virgin Islands Coral
  Reef National Monument, south of St. John, US Virgin Islands. The backscatter values
  are in relative 8-bit (0 - 255) values, since neither intensity surface was calibrated.
  Soft bottom and rhodolith habitat types were delineated and classified from this
  backscatter image. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with
  NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired
  multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04 and 2/1/05
  to 2/12/05. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder
  (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data
  is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The backscatter component of the bathymetry
  data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using Geocoder 3.2.1 software.
  Acoustic backscatter mosaics are an important piece of information when characterizing
  surficial seafloor features and delineating benthic habitats. The project was conducted
  to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and
  depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according
  to their own needs and standards. For a complete description of the data acquisition
  and processing parameters, please see the data acquisition and processing reports
  (DAPRs) for projects: NF-04-06-VI and NF-05-05-VI (Monaco & Rooney, 2004; Battista
  & Lazar, 2005).\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\": \"bbox-east-long\",\n\t\t\"value\":
