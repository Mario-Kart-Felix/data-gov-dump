    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Planktonic larval stages of many benthic
    marine invertebrates are especially susceptible to environmental stress, such as
    the presence of pollution. Recruitment of these larvae onto the seafloor frequently
    controls benthic community structure. We thus evaluated larval availability and
    recruitment of macrobenthos over a period of 14 months at 12 stations within Mamala
    Bay, to assess the ecosystem impacts of major point and non-point sources of pollution.
    The major point source of pollution in the Bay, the Sand Island outfall, had no
    detectable negative impact on larval recruitment, even though the sewage plume frequently
    bathed our stations nearest the outfall. In contrast, larval availability and recruitment
    were significantly reduced at two study sites located 1 km west of the Pearl Harbor
    Channel (1 and 3 km offshore respectively). These two sites are likely bathed by
    a larval- depleted water mass whose source is not presently known. Possible sources
    include: 1) Pearl Harbor, whose outflow may be larval-depleted due to larval mortality
    caused by non-point source pollution, or the settlement of larvae inside Pearl Harbor
    before they are advected offshore (recruitment shadow), 2) offshore waters, or 3)
    coastal waters west of Pearl Harbor. It is difficult to determine the source(s)
    of waters bathing our offshore Pearl Harbor study sites because circulation patterns
    in the area are complicated by the convergence of semi-diurnal tidal flows located
    offshore of the area between Keehi Lagoon and the Honouliuli outfall (MB-6). The
    scale of hydrographic observations conducted as part of MB-6 were spatially too
    coarse to determine the location of the convergence therefore making it impossible
    to determine the source of water that most frequently bathes our western offshore
    Pearl Harbor study sites. Outflow from Keehi Lagoon produced a distinct, low-clarity
    water mass which appeared to enhance larval availability and recruitment of some
    taxa (especially balanomorph barnacles). Coral recruitment rates were extremely
    low across the bay (6 x 10-5 cm-2). Low coral recruitment rates are most likely
    due to inadequate larval supply since percent cover of live adult coral (coral larval
    source) is less than 5% throughout most of the bay. Coral recruitment rates observed
    in earlier studies in Maunalua Bay (located east of Diamond Head), which has similar
    live coral cover and few significant inputs of pollution, are also extremely low.
    This suggests that pollution inputs to Mamala Bay are not responsible for the observed
    low coral recruitment rates.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
