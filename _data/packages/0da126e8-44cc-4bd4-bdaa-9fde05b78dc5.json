	"notes": "Samples were collected at six National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) in Tennessee (Chickasaw, Cross Creeks, Hatchie, Lake Isom, Lower Hatchie and Reelfoot) from 1988 and 1990. Fish samples were obtained at each of these refuges and sediment samples were collected at three (Cross Creeks, Lower Hatchie and Reelfoot). Results for analyses of a bald eagle egg collected at Reelfoot NWR and turtles collected at Cross Creeks NWR are also included. All fish and sediment samples were analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 22 chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides or related compounds, and 13 metals. Sediment samples from Reelfoot NWR and Lower Hatchie NWR (Sunk Lake) were also analyzed for six chlorophenoxy herbicides, none of which were detected. Nine additional organochlorine compounds were analyzed in fish and sediment samples from Lower Hatchie (Sunk Lake), but were not detected. Ten additional metals were analyzed in fish samples from Reelfoot and Cross Creeks NWRs. Thallium was analyzed in samples from Chickasaw, Hatchie, Lake Isom and Lower Hatchie NWRs, but was not detected. Thirty-four fish samples representing 12 species were collected. Gar specimens, either spotted or shortnose, were obtained from all refuges except Cross Creeks, where channel catfish and blue catfish were collected. Of the 34 fish samples collected, DDE was detected in all except the blue catfish from Pool 8 at Cross Creeks NWR. Mercury (Hg) was found in all 34 fish and five turtle samples. PCBs were detected in all four fish samples from Chickasaw NWR, three gar samples from Lower Hatchie NWR, and four catfish samples and one turtle sample from Cross Creeks NWR. DDT was detected only at Hatchie NWR, where it was found in four of the five samples collected. None of the pesticides, herbicides or PCBs analyzed in this study were detected in the sediment samples which were collected. The PCB residues in our fish samples were well below whole-body concentrations linked to mortality and reduced growth in adult fish of the same, or closely related, species. At several locations, total PCBs exceeded the whole-body residue (0.4mg\/kg) for Aroclor 1242 which has been associated with low egg survival and fry deformities in rainbow trout (USEPA 1980). The total PCB concentration (5.4 ppm) in the bald eagle egg from Reelfoot NWR was in the lower ranges reported for the Columbia River and the Great Lakes. It also fell into the range of concentrations associated with production of one young per active nesting pair in the Great lakes (Kubiak and Best 1991). DDE in the bald eagle egg from Reelfoot NWR was in the lower range of concentrations associated with reduced productivity in bald eagles and 12-15% eggshell thinning in ospreys. It was well below the egg residue associated with 10% eggshell thinning in bald eagle eggs from the Columbia River basin. Mercury residues in fish samples were well below concentrations associated with mortality in walleye, brook trout and fathead minnows. In one sample (bowfin - Lower Hatchie NWR), the Hg concentration (0.7 ppm) approached lower concentrations associated with diminished predator avoidance behavior in mosquitofish (Kania and O'Hara 1974). Mercury in the bald eagle egg from Reelfoot NWR was below the geometric mean in unhatched bald eagle eggs reported by Wiemeyer et al. (1984). It was also well below the concentration associated with decreased reproductive success by Newton and Galbraith (1991).",
