  is an important part in running an efficient and cost-effective building. Many problems
  in a buildingu2019s system can go undetected for long periods of time, leading to
  expensive repairs or wasted resources. This project aims to help detect and diagnose
  the buildingu2018s health with data driven methods throughout the day. Orca and
  IMS are two state of the art algorithms that observe an array of building health
  sensors and provide feedback on the overall systemu2019s health as well as localize
  the problem to one, or possibly two, components. With this level of feedback the
  hope is to quickly identify problems and provide appropriate maintenance while reducing
  the number of complaints and service calls.rnrn rnrn**Introduction:**rnrnrnTo prepare
  these technologies for the new installation, the proposed methods are being tested
  on a current system that behaves similarly to the future green building. Building
  241 was determined to best resemble the proposed building 232 and therefore was
  chosen for this study.rnBuilding 241 is currently outfitted with 34 sensors that
  monitor the heating & cooling temperatures for the air and water systems as well
  as other various subsystem states. The daily sensor recordings were logged and sent
  to the IDU group for analysis. The period of analysis was focused from July 1st
  through August 10th 2009.rn rnrn**Methodology:**rnrnrnThe two algorithms used for
  analysis were Orca and IMS. Both methods look for anomalies using a distanced based
  scoring approach.rnOrca has the ability to use a single data set and find outliers
  within that data set. This tactic was applied to each day.  After scoring  each
  time sample throughout a given day the Orca score profiles were compared by computing
  the correlation against all other days. Days with high overall correlations were
  considered normal however days with lower overall correlations were more anomalous.
  \ IMS, on the other hand, needs a normal  set of data to build a model, which can
  be applied to a set of test data to asses how anomaly the particular data set is.rnThe
  typical days  identified by Orca were used as the reference/training set for IMS,
  while all the other days were passed through IMS resulting in an anomaly score profile
  for each day. The mean of the IMS score profile was then calculated for each day
  to produce a summary IMS score. These summary scores were ranked and the top outliers
  were  identified (see Figure 1).  Once the anomalies were identified the contributing
  parameters were then ranked by the algorithm.rnrn rnrn**Analysis:**rnrnrnThe contributing
  parameters identified by IMS were localized to the return air temperature duct system.rnrn-7/03/09
  (Figure 2 & 3) AHU-1 Return Air Temperature (RAT) Calculated Average Return Air
  Temperaturern-7/19/09 (Figure 3 & 4) AHU-2 Return Air Temperature (RAT) Calculated
  Average Return Air TemperaturernrnrnIMS identified significantly higher temperatures
  compared to other days during the month of July and August.rn rnrn**Conclusion:**rnrnrnThe
  proposed algorithms Orca and IMS have shown that they were able to pick up significant
  anomalies in the building system as well as diagnose the anomaly by identifying
  the sensor values that were anomalous.  In the future these methods can be used
  on live streaming data and produce a real time anomaly score to help building maintenance
  with detection and diagnosis of problems.\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S. Government

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
