	"notes": "Ongoing work in advanced air-vehicles, such as ultra-light-weight truss-braced and elastically tailored concepts is beginning to provide the insight necessary to meet NASA's N+3 transport system goals.  Unfortunately, contemporary analysis methods are unsuited for aeroservoelastic analysis of such configurations suffering from accessibility, usability, fidelity or resource constraints.  Design tools have typically been developed using configuration dependent low-fidelity approaches that are unsuitable to reliably analyze advanced configurations.  Contemporary aeromechanics solvers (i.e. viscous compressible Computational Fluid Dynamics coupled to Finite Element structural models) can analyze advanced concepts, but require significant user input to support advanced configurations, not to mention extensive computational resources.  What has long been needed is an approach that bridges the middle ground to enable aeroservoelastic analysis at the \"appropriate level of fidelity for the problem at hand\", while reliably permitting the novel application of aeroelastic knowledge to new concepts, in addition to supporting wind-tunnel and flight tests by enabling the efficient investigation of flight dynamics, flutter, stability and control.  By exploiting Continuum Dynamics Inc.'s extensive experience developing fully-coupled aeromechanics methods, we propose the development of a new rapid, reliable, variable&amp;#150;fidelity first-principles physics-based aeroservoelastic analysis to support concept evaluation, wind-tunnel\/flight testing and design.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
