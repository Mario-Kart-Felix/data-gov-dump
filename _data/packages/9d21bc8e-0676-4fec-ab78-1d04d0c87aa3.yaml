    or are in final preparation for submission from the Phase I data. Phase II has been
    completed, with a total of 12 subjects finishing the protocol. Each subject attempted
    to complete 9 laps of our obstacle course at two different paces; one representing
    the average pace of the Apollo astronauts during lunar EVAs (VO2 of ~20 ml/kg/min)
    and one at an estimated suited Martian cost of 30 ml/kg/min. All subjects were able
    to complete the course at the Lunar pace. However, at the Martian pace, 5 of the
    12 subjects failed ~ lap 5. Subjects who completed the Martian pace had a VO2max
    on average of 44.3 &amp;plusmn; 5.0 ml/kg/min, while the 5 who failed (3 men, 2
    women) had a VO2max of 36.8 &amp;plusmn; 2.9 ml/kg/min. Further, the Martian pace
    was likely at or above the critical speed of the subjects who failed. EMG and Near
    InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) signals differed by pace, but were not different between
    those who successfully completed both paces and those who failed at the Martian
    pace. Initial analysis of EMG and NIRS data failed to find any differences in the
    responses between those that failed and those that successfully completed the 9
    laps. These results are being written up for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In
    addition, the hoist suspension system is operational to the point of being able
    to conduct pilot experiments. We have acquired preliminary VO2 responses during
    ambulation at 3 mph under 1-g, Martian (3/8-g), and Lunar (1/6-g) offloading. In
    addition, during the Lunar offloading, subjects naturally and unconsciously assumed
    an almost skipping stride pattern, very similar to that adopted by the Apollo astronauts
    during lunar EVAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
