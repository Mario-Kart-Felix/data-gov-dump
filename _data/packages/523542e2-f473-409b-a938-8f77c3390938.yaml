  national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile
  is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to
  cover the entire nation. nThe Coastline Shapefile includes all features within the
  MTDB Class \"Coastline\" distinguished where the MAF/TIGER Feature Classification
  Code (MTFCC) for the feature in MTDB is L4150. The coastline included in this shapefile
  was delineated by the Census Bureau in the MAF/TIGER database based on water measurement
  class for display of statistical information only; its depiction and designation
  for statistical purposes does not constitute a determination of jurisdictional authority
  or rights of ownership or entitlement and it is not a legal land description. This
  shapefile should be used for data presentation purposes only.  It is not the official
