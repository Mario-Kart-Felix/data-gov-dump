    backscatter mosaic of the southern shore of St. John, US Virgin Islands.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA
    Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel, in collaboration with NOAA vessel
    Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam
    bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired
    with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed
    by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied
    (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using
    final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84.
    The backscatter component of the bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically
    corrected using Geocoder 2.7 software.While the project was conducted to meet IHO
    Order 2 accuracy standards, there is a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in the
    dataset that the user should take into consideration when performing any analysis.",nt"owner_org":
