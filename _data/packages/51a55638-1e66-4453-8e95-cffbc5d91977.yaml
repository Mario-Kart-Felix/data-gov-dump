    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The minimization of vibration-induced damage
    has become a critical issue for rocket launch ground support electronics (GSE).
    GSE located near a major rocket launch can be exposed to damaging environments including
    heat, rocket plume impingement, vibration, and acoustics. This extreme vibratory
    environment results in the need for extensive check out and frequent repairs of
    GSE systems after each launch. Another consequence is the need for extensive design
    and qualification testing to ensure equipment survivability.rnrnPassive GSE vibration
    isolation systems often have natural resonances within the broad excitation spectrum,
    resulting in poor equipment protection. Additionally, passive isolation systems
    can only be tuned for one excitation type (amplitude / frequency) and one GSE rack
    arrangement. If the expected vibration spectrum changes, the passive isolation system
    is no longer optimized and requires redesign. Furthermore, if the inertial properties
    of the GSE rack itself changes (rack or drawer is replaced or rearranged), the passive
    isolation system will no longer function properly which may lead to catastrophic
    failure.rnrnTo overcome these deficiencies, Techno-Sciences Inc, in collaboration
    with the University of Maryland, proposes to develop an innovative Adaptive Magnetorheological
    Isolator (AMI) system that will automatically adjust its energy absorbing capabilities
    to real-time environmental measurements as well as GSE rack properties. Such a system
    will utilize internal motion sensors coupled with an on-board microcontroller to
    provide automatic adaptation to the excitation as well as the inertial properties
    of the supported rack. In doing so, the system will eliminate damaging natural resonances
    and provide optimal vibration isolation at all times. Because of its adaptability
    and optimal vibration isolation capabilities, the AMI system will significantly
    reduce design and life-cycle costs and enhance equipment reliability.rn",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
