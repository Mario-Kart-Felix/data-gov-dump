	"notes": "Spaceports of the future will utilize new granular materials in unique applications including insulation for cryogenic tanks and Lunar regolith processing for usable resources. New granular insulation materials such as microspheres provide the opportunity to construct and operate safe and energy-efficient cryogenic storage tanks in the future. These materials have been demonstrated in small-scale tanks; however, no basis for reliable extrapolation to larger scales currently exists. Technology Applications, Inc. and the Colorado School of Mines propose to develop Advanced Granular Systems Modeling (AGSM) software to provide for reliable predictions of detailed mechanical behavior in these applications. AGSM is an innovative approach in modeling the behavior of granular materials through modified distinct element modeling (DEM) combined with a unique experimental validation technique leading to predictions in larger (macroscale) systems currently unattainable. The Phase 1 work plan will focus on the case of microsphere-based cryogenic insulation and is expected to result in a clear correlation in predicted stress concentration trends with respect to system scale and experimental results. In Phase 2, AGSM will be developed to provide predictions of granular material behavior for other materials, containment geometries, and scales to meet the needs of NASA as well as other industrial applications.rnrn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
