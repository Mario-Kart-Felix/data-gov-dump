	"notes": "This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate monolayer and dual layer coating of SiC fiber by leveraging Laser Chemical Vapor Deposition techniques developed by Free Form Fibers for direct fiber production. Ceramic fibers, particularly SiC, must be coated in order to protect the fibers from oxidizing environments, and to allow their use in SiC CMC's. FFF's LCVD techniques can be modified for fast, high purity coating. The Phase I effort includes creating a custom reactor that leverages FFF's existing gas precursor delivery infrastructure, and passing existing monofilament SiC fiber through the reactor to coat with BN in real time. Reversing direction and coating the coated fiber with SiC will be done for dual layer coating. Phase II would scale the process to serially dualcoat a unidirectional moving parallel array of hundreds or thousands of moving fibers. If successful, industry would finally have a reliable in-line approach to fiber coating prior to tow production, because spreading and coating already-sized tows is nearly impossible. Based on prior coating experience and other related proposals, Phase I work would take us from TRL3 to TRL4. Phase II could take us to TRL4 or TRL5, either on a FFF or other commercial fiber production facility. ",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
