    files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information
    from then               U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically
    Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The
    MTDB representsn               a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps
    between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as
    an independent datan               set, or they can be combined to cover the entire
    nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of
    a county or equivalentn               entity, and were defined by local participants
    as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau
    delineated the censusn               tracts in situations where no local participant
    existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary
    purpose of censusn               tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic
    units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial
    censuses. Censusn               tracts generally have a population size between
    1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated,
    census tracts weren               designed to be homogeneous with respect to population
    characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census
    tracts variesn               widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical
    changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and
    so forth, mayn               require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts
    occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial
    populationn               decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible
    and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil
    division (MCD)n               or incorporated place boundaries in some States and
    situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the
    governmentaln               boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.
    State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census
    geographicn               hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may
    consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census
    tracts aren               coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are
    themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400
    through 9499n               was enforced for census tracts that include a majority
    American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily
    coveredn               by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or
    off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those
    censusn               tracts that contained little or no population and represented
    a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation,
    orn               a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998
    was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.n
