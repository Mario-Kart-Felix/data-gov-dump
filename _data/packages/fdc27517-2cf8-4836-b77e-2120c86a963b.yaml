  geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore of Pacifica map area, California. The
  vector data file is included in \"Geology_OffshorePacifica.zip,\" which is accessible
  from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshorePacifica/data_catalog_OffshorePacifica.html.
  The continental shelf within Californiau2019s State waters in the Pacifica area
  is shallow (water depths of 0 to about 40 m) and flat continental shelf with a very
  gentle (less than 0.5 degrees) offshore dip. The morphology and geology of this
  shelf result from the interplay between local tectonics, sea-level rise, sedimentary
  processes, and oceanography. Tectonic influences are related to local faulting and
  uplift (see below). Sea level has risen about 125 to 130 m over the last about 21,000
  years (for example, Lambeck and Chappel, 2001; Gornitz, 2009), leading to progressive
  eastward migration (a few tens of km) of the shoreline and wave-cut platform, and
  associated transgressive erosion and deposition (for example, Catuneanu, 2006).
  The Offshore of Pacifica map area is now mainly an open shelf that is subjected
  to full, and sometimes severe, Pacific Ocean wave energy and strong currents. Most
  of the offshore map area is covered by marine sediments; artificial fill (unit af)
  occurs only at the site of the Pacifica Pier. Given their relatively shallow depths
  and exposure to high wave energy, modern shelf deposits are mostly sand (unit Qms).
  More coarse-grained sands and gravels (units Qmss and Qmsc) are primarily recognized
  on the basis of bathymetry and high backscatter (Bathymetry--Offshore of Pacifica
  map area, California, and Backscatter--Offshore of Pacifica map area, California).
  Unit Qmsc occurs as nearshore bars (less than 12 m water depth) for about two kilometers
  north of Mussel Rock and more locally offshore Pacifica, and in two isolated patches
  farther offshore at about 25 m water depth. Unit Qmss forms erosional lags in features
  known as u201crippled scour depressionsu201d (for example, Cacchione and others,
  1984) or u201csorted bedformsu201d (for example, Trembanis and Hume, 2011), at water
  depths of about 15 to 25 m, in contact with offshore bedrock uplifts and unit Qms.
  Such features are common along this stretch of the California coast where offshore
  sandy sediment can be relatively thin (thus unable to fill the depressions) due
  to both lack of sediment supply from rivers and to significant sediment erosion
  and offshore transport during large winter storms. Although the general areas in
  which both unit Qmss scour depressions and unit Qmsc bars occur are not likely to
  change substantially, the boundaries of the unit(s) are likely ephemeral, changing
  seasonally and during significant storm events. Areas where shelf sediments form
  thin (less than 2 m) veneers over low relief bedrock of the Franciscan Complex (see
  below) occur in the northern half of the map and are mapped as unit Qms/KJf. This
  hybrid unit is recognized and delineated based on the combination of flat relief,
  continuity with moderate to high relief onshore or offshore bedrock outcrops, high-resolution
  seismic-reflection data, and in some cases moderate to high backscatter. The thin
  sediment layer is regarded as ephemeral and dynamic, and may or may not be present
  at a specific location based on storms, seasonal to annual patterns of sediment
  movement, or longer-term climate cycles. In a nearby, similarly high-energy setting,
  Storlazzi and others (2011) have described seasonal burial and exhumation of submerged
  bedrock in northern Monterey Bay. Offshore bedrock exposed at the seafloor is mapped
  as Jurassic and Cretaceous Franciscan Complex, undivided (unit KJf); Cretaceous
  granite (unit Kgr); Tertiary and (or) Cretaceous rock, undivided (unit TKu); unnamed
  sansdstone, shale and conglomerate of Paleocene age (unit Tss); and the Upper Miocene
  and Pliocene Purisima Formation (unit Tp). These units are delineated by extending
  outcrops and trends from mapped onshore geology and from their distinctive surface
  textures as revealed by high-resolution bathymetry (Bathymetry--Offshore of Pacifica
  map area, California). Purisima Formation outcrops in the southernmost part of the
  offshore map area form distinctive \"ribs,\" caused by differential erosion of variably
  resistant, interbedded lithologies (for example, sandstone and mudstone). In contrast,
  granitic rocks have a densely cross-fractured, rough surface texture, and both the
  Franciscan Complex and the unnamed Paleocene sedimentary unit have a more masssive,
  irregular, and smoother surface texture. Purisima Formation outcrops occur in water
  as deep as 35 m, whereas other bedrock units occur in shallower (less than 20 m)
  water depths, most commonly adjacent to coastal points underlain by bedrock (for
  example, Pedro Point and Montara Point). Map unit polygons were digitized over underlying
  2-meter base layers developed from multibeam bathymetry and backscatter data. The
  bathymetry and backscatter data were collected between 2006 and 2010. References
