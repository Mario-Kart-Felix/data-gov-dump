    Raster model characterizing the contribution of phosphorus (P) to streams from weathering
    and erosion of surficial geologic materials for the conterminous United States,
    and has been created as part of the SPARROW (Spatially Referenced Regressions on
    Watershed Attributes) water-quality model implementation. SPARROW provides estimates
    of total nitrogen and phosphorus load in surface waters from point and non-point
    sources. This data set represents only potential for P contributions, and does not
    include N. The characterization of contribution of P from geologic materials will
    help separate the effects of natural or background sources from anthropogenic sources
    of P, such as from municipal wastewater or agricultural practices. The potential
    of a watershed to contribute P from naturally occurring geologic materials in the
    watershed to the adjacent receiving stream is characterized using geochemical data
    from bed-sediment samples (USGS National Geochemical Survey, National Uranium Resource
    Evaluation (NURE), Smith 1979) collected from first-order streams in relatively
    undisturbed watersheds. Bed sediment samples were collected from 1975 through 1980.
    The bed-sediment phosphorus concentrations (BSPconc) in this data set represent
    BSPconc in the absence of anthropogenic sources and therefore spatial variation
    in BSPconc can be used to indicate spatial variation in the potential to contribute
    naturally occurring P from the geologic materials in the watershed to the stream.
    A continuous mapped distribution of BSPconc in headwater streams for the conterminous
    U.S. was prepared by summarizing BSPconc from 50,740 bed-sediment samples by geologic
    unit using regional-scale geologic map units (GMU's). The GMU's delineate areas
    with similar lithochemistry based on geologic age as well as ecoregion units. GMUu00e2u0080u0099s
    were created by combining surficial geology (Hunt, Charles D., 1979) with Level
    IV Ecoregion units (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2011). This data set represents
    the mean BSPconc value for each GMU. The spatial pattern of BSPconc in headwater
    streams is offered as a data layer, representing best available information at the
    regional scale, with the caveat that its performance as a surrogate for contribution
    of P from watershed geologic materials to in-stream levels of P is weakened by not
    accounting for variability across headwater streams in the rates of net deposition
    and processing of P in the streambed.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
