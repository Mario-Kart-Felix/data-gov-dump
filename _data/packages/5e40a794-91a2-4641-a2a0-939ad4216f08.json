	"notes": "&lt;p&gt;rntEnergy consumption and cost are a continuing issue in the world, including JSC Buildings.&amp;nbsp; New technologies and designs in the commercial world have made available LED lighting tubes that can be easily retrofitted/replaced into standard fluorescent rod light fixtures found commonly in JSC offices/buildings.&amp;nbsp; While the upfront cost of the hardware exceeds standard fluorescent rods (by 2 to 4 times), the energy savings is quoted as up to 50&#37; or more.&amp;nbsp; The retrofit time/complexity is minimal, in that the ballast must be removed or bypassed, but the rods then fit into existing fixtures. The proposal is to evaluate and test at least two COTS versions of LED light rods, in a typical office area, for the factors of overall lighting quality, energy savings, labor time/cost for retrofit, and delta in maintenance required based on quoted hardware life expectancy vs. typical cost for repair/replacement of fluorescent&amp;nbsp; fixtures.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntThis project completed retrofit of three typical office areas in Bldg. 7 with prototype LED rods from two vendors.&amp;nbsp; The measured savings in operating power was approximately 73&#37;, which did not include the savings for air conditioning from removal or bypass of the hot ballast.&amp;nbsp; The measured quality of the lighting (in Foot Candles at varying distance) was greater with the LED bulbs, without consideration to the fixture covering.&amp;nbsp; Retrofit was demonstrated as simple to implement.&amp;nbsp; The benefits of this technology are significant, and further study to implement this new technology into laboratories and other areas of JSC is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;div style="margin-left: 0.5in"&gt;rnt&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rnt&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
