	"notes": "NASA Ames Research Centeru2019s Sustainability Base is a newrn50,000 sq. ft. LEED Platinum office building. Plug loadsrnare expected to account for a significant portion of the overallrnenergy consumption. This is because building design choicesrnhave resulted in greatly reduced energy demand from Heating,rnVentilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and lightingrnsystems, which are major contributors to energy consumptionrnin traditional buildings. In anticipation of the importance ofrnplug loads in Sustainability Base, a pilot study was conductedrnto collect data from a variety of plug loads. A number of casesrnof anomalous or unhealthy behavior were observed includingrnschedule-based rule failures, time-to-standby errors, changedrnloads, and inter-channel anomalies. These issues prevent effectivernplug load management; therefore, they are importantrnto promptly identify and correct. The Inductive MonitoringrnSystem (IMS) data mining algorithm was chosen to identifyrnerrors. This paper details how an automated data analysis programrnwas created, tested and implemented using IMS. Thisrnprogram will be applied to Sustainability Base to maintainrneffective plug load management system performance, identifyrnmalfunctioning equipment, and reduce building energyrnconsumption.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
