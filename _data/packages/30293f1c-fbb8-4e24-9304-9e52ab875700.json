	"notes": "This data set contains three ASCII files (.txt format). One data file contains above-ground biomass, litter, litterfall, herbivory, biomass change, and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) estimates for a late secondary moist subtropical forest based on measurements from 16 permanent study plots located along an elevational (60-290 m) and topological gradient within the 132-ha Cinnamon Bay watershed on St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands. The purpose of the study was to provide information on forest structure, species composition, and forest productivity along environmental gradients, including the effects of hurricanes and drought. The other two files provide climate records from nearby weather stations (1917-1981).Above-ground biomass was measured every 5 years (1983-2003). Litterfall accumulation was determined in 1992-1993. In 1983, total above-ground biomass on all plots combined averaged 13,870 g\/m2; by 2003 during a post-hurricane recovery period, it had declined by nearly 7 percent. In 1983, biomass was greatest on the summit, intermediate on slopes and valleys, and least on ridges; by 2003, the quantities for all sites had converged except on the summit plot.In 1992, ANPP was estimated based on annual litterfall accumulation (897 g\/m2\/year) plus biomass change due to delayed mortality (142 g\/m2\/year) plus estimated herbivory (25 g\/m2\/year), giving a total ANPP of 1,064 g\/m2\/year. Periodic storms and drought appear to maintain the forest in a disturbed state.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
