    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The availability of an air vehicle to perform
    missions or generate sorties is negatively impacted by time spent on the ground
    due to scheduled servicing and maintenance. Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) helps
    maximize the availability of air assets by servicing the air vehicle based on actual
    condition as opposed to a fixed number of operating hours. Prognostics and Health
    Management (PHM) enables improved CBM on air vehicles by comparing in-situ sensor
    data to prognostic models of components and subsystems to predict wear as it occurs.
    Integration of these PHM systems with an autonomic logistics infrastructure can
    lead to even greater increases in sortie generation rates and decreases in maintenance
    cost and logistics burden by eliminating unnecessary preventative maintenance as
    well as identifying failures occurring outside the normal scheduled maintenance
    cycle. Aurora's innovative approach utilizes information from existing sensors (i.e.,
    does not require additional sensors added to the vehicle, hence, 'sensor-free')
    to determine PHM.rnCurrent implementation of PHM is focused on new designs of manned
    aircraft to allow co-development of the PHM system and its specific sensors. Unmanned
    Aerial Systems (UAS) have sensors and subsystems already installed that can provide
    the capability for a PHM retrofit on in-fleet systems. UAV specific subsystems,
    such as the autopilot, also provide the opportunity for new PHM capabilities beyond
    those considered in manned aircraft.rnrnAurora proposes the Integrated Vehicle Health
    Management System (IVHMS). Aurora's IVHMS will compare models of the aircraft in
    different configurations to an estimate of the current state of the aircraft in
    order to generate a better understanding of the real-time operating condition of
    the vehicle and its constituent components. The IVHMS uses these capabilities to
    generate a vehicle-wide identification of systems in order to detect faults as they
    influence overall performance.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
