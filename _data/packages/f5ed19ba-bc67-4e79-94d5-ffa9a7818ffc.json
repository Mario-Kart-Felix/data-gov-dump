	"notes": "Many wireless technologies are already available for sensor applications. It is inevitable that many non-interoperable wireless technologies between 400 MHz and 5.8 GHz will be deployed for wireless sensor applications. As a result, monitoring across different wireless interfaces will become a challenge for sensor data collection and management due to lack of interoperability between them.  Mobitrum is proposing a dynamically adjust transceiver that uses a waveform-DNA approach similar to a process of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) coding structure used in medical world. This effort addresses important technology gap for interfacing with various wireless sensor networks and transmitting/receiving data over short and long distances. This effort will include: (1) Finding the waveforms of RF signals, (2) Reading/comparing the waveform, and (3) Controlling the waveform.  The waveforms of the interested RF signals are pre-digitized and stored in the transceiver to compare with the one that is actually received through a wideband antenna.  Once the type of a waveform is identified, the intelligent software in the transceiver will configure its RF characteristics to adapt wireless interface dynamically.  The proposed enabling technology will provide NASA an effective wireless device for Earth science, data relay, and other situational awareness.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
