    LiDAR Data Acquisition and Processing Production Task USGS Contract No. G10PC00057
    Task Order No. G13PD00796 Woolpert Order No. 073667 CONTRACTOR: Woolpert, Inc. This
    data set is comprised of LiDAR point cloud data, raster DEM, hydrologic 3-d breaklines,
    raster intensity, survey control, project tile index, and project data extent which
    encompasses approximately 2120 square miles along with a 100 meter buffer over several
    areas in central to eastern Massachusetts. The coverage of the data includes slivers
    of areas that were missed by previous lidar acquisitions. LiDAR data is a remotely
    sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The LiDAR
    sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial
    measurement technologies. The LiDAR systems collect data point clouds that are used
    to produce detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made
    structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at
    a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7m. The final products include files containing
    classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS
    IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information,
    which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include
    hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey
    reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format,
    and LAS swath data. Collected swath files that were that were larger than 2GB were
    provided in multiple sub-swath files, each less than 2GB. The LiDAR data was provided
    in 1,500 meters x 1,500 meters tiles in the UTM projection. The LiDAR tile file
    names were derived from the southwest corner of each tile and are named based on
    the US National Grid. Product specifics can be found in the processing description
    section of this file. Ground conditions: No snow; Leaf off. The tide window requirements
    for the lidar data acquisition; Tidally impacted waters within the AOI are expected
    to be acquired at Predicted MLW +- 2 hours exclusive of neap tide.; The bare earth
    DEMs along the coast may have a variance in the water heights due to temporal differences
    during the lidar data acquisition and will be represented in DEM as a seam-like
    anomaly. This is especially true in areas of tidal flats. One coastal elevation
    was applied to entire project area. Due to differing acquisition dates and thus
    differing tide levels there will be areas in the DEM exhibiting what appears to
    be "digging" water features. Sometimes as much as approximately 1 meter. This
    was done to ensure that no coastal hydro feature was "floating" above ground surface.
    This coastal elevation will also affect connected river features wherein a sudden
    increase in flow will be observed in the DEM to accommodate the coastal elevation
    value; During Hydrologic breakline collection, Woolpert excluded obvious above-water
    piers or pier-like structures from the breakline placement. Some features extend
    beyond the apparent coastline and are constructed in a manner that can be considered
    an extension of the ground. These features were treated as ground during classification
    and subsequent hydrologic delineation. In all cases, professional practice was applied
    to delineate what appeared to be the coast based on data from multiple sources;
    Cranberry bogs are existent in the project. These are filled with shallow water
    for short periods during the year but were not collected as hydrologic features;
    Due to the many substructures and the complexity of the urban environment, interpolation
    and apparent "divots" (caused by tinning) may be evident in the surface of the
    DEM. Temporal differences from lidar collects in and around hydrologic features
    may manifest in the DEM as differing water levels. In all cases, professional practice
    was applied to best represent the topography. Data for the task order is referenced
    to the UTM Zone 19N, North American Datum of 1983 (2011), and NAVD88, in meters.
    However, a small portion of the AOI crossed into UTM 18 and this data is referenced
    to the UTM18N, North American Datum of 1983 (2011), and NAVD88 GEOID12A, in meters",nt"license_title":
