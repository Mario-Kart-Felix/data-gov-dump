	"notes": "The Nimbus-4 Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) Level 1 Radiance Data contain thermal emissions of the Earth's atmosphere at wave numbers between 400 and 1600 cm**-1, with a nominal resolution of 2.8 cm**-1.  The data also contain documentation information, reference calibration, average instrument temperatures, and a summary for each orbital pass.  The data, originally written on IBM 360 machines, were recovered from 9-track magnetic tapes.  The data are archived in their original IBM 32-bit word binary record format, and each file contains an entire day of measurements.  The product contains data from April 9, 1970 (day of year 99) through Jan 31, 1971 (day of year 31).nnIRIS was included on the Nimbus-4 satellite and successfully launched on April 8, 1970.  The instrument was designed to provide information on the vertical structure of the atmosphere and on the emissive properties of the earth's surface by measuring the surface and atmospheric radiation in the 6.25 to 25 micrometer range using a modified Michelson interferometer.  IRIS viewed along the satellite track direction with a spatial resolution of 94 km at nadir.  A Fourier transform was applied to the interferograms to produce thermal emmision spectra of the Earth which could be used to derive vertical profiles of temperature, water vapor, and ozone, as well as other parameters of meteorological interest.  The Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) experiment on Nimbus-4 is a follow on experiment to the Nimbus-3 IRIS experiment.  The IRIS Principal Investigator was Dr. Rudolf A. Hanel.nnThese data were previously archived at NASA NSSDC under the entry ID ESAD-00093 (originally 70-025A-03A).",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
