	"notes": "This data set provides the results of analyses of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images for selective logging activity in the Brazilian states of Para, Mato Gross, Rondonia, Roraima, and Acre over the years 1999 through 2001. Images were analyzed using the Carnegie Landsat Analysis System (CLAS) to detect and to quantify the amount of damage due to selective logging in the major timber-production states of the Brazilian Amazon. This approach provided automated image analysis using atmospheric modeling for detection of forest canopy openings, surface debris, and bare soil exposed by forest disturbances; and pattern-recognition techniques. CLAS provides detailed measurements of forest-canopy damage at a spatial resolution of 30 x 30m. Fifteen GeoTiff format files are included -- one for each of the three years from 1999-2001 for each of the five states. Each GeoTiff is a single band image where each pixel represents if logging activity was or was not detected. A zero (0) value indicates that no logging was detected, while a value of one (1) indicates that damage from logging was detected. The 15 GeoTiff (*.tif) files have been compressed into one *.zip file.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
