    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "After reviewing key background concepts
    in fuzzy systems and evolutionary computing, we will focus on the use of local fuzzy
    models, which are related to both kernel regressions and locally weighted learning.
    Instead of using a manual approach to develop such models, we use evolutionary algorithms
    to search in the design space of these models.rnrnWith these models we will determine
    the remaining life of a unit in a fleet of vehicles. Instead of developing individual
    models (based on the track history of each unit) or developing a global model (based
    on the collective track history of the fleet), we propose local fuzzy models based
    on clusters of peers, similar units with comparable utilization and performance.
    For each cluster of peers we create a local fuzzy model. We combine the fuzzy peer-based
    approach for performance modeling with an evolutionary framework for model maintenance.
    Our process generates a collection of competing models, evaluates their performance
    in light of the currently available data, refines the best models using evolutionary
    search, and selects the best one after a finite number of iterations. This process
    is repeated periodically to automatically produce updated and improved versions
    of the model.rnrnTo illustrate this methodology we chose an asset selection problem:
    given a fleet of industrial vehicles (diesel electric locomotives), we want to select
    the best subset (of fixed or variable size) for mission-critical utilization. To
    this end, we predict the remaining life for each unit in the fleet. We then sort
    the fleet using this prediction and select the highest ranked units. The model chosen
    to perform this prediction/selection task is a fuzzy instance based model. A series
    of experiments using data from locomotive operations were conducted and the results
    from an initial validation exercise are presented.rnrnThe approach of constructing
    local predictive models using fuzzy similarity with neighboring points along appropriate
    dimensions is not specific to any asset type, but it applies to many other Prognostics
    and Health Management (PHM) problems. ",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
