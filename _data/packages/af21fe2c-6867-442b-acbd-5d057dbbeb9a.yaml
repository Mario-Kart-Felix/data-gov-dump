  unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
  thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
  years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
  we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
  to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
  in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
  to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
  air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
  Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
  spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
  explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
  and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
  rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
  expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
  NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
  to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
  around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
  continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
  Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
  Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
  such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"title\": \"National

  algorithmic approaches and introduced some of the basics associated with probabilistic
  predictions and a required architecture for performing prognostics on critical aerospace
  systems.rnPrognosis is a critical element of a HM system and has the promise to
  realize major benefits for cost avoidance and safety improvement for fielded systems.
  It also presents a number of challenges to the HM system designer, primarily due
  to the need to properly model damage progression and to deal with large-grain uncertainty.
  Long-term prediction of a faultu2019s evolution to the point thatmay result in a
  failure requires means to represent and manage the inherent uncertainty. Moreover,
  accurate and precise prognosis demands good models of the fault growth and statistically
  sufficient samples of failure data to assist in training, validating, and fine tuning
  prognostic algorithms. Prognosis performance metrics, robust algorithms, and test
  platforms that may provide needed data have been the target of HM researchers in
  the recent past. Many accomplishments have been reported but major challenges still
  remain to be addressed.rnTo address the issue of inherent uncertainties that are
  the aggregate of many unknowns and can result in considerable prediction variability,
  the concept of adaptive prognosis was introduced. In that case, available, albeit
  imperfect, information is used to update elements of the prognostic model. Only
  one of many approaches for accomplishing this was briefly introduced, namely, the
  particle filter. Other statistical update techniques include Bayesian updating,
  constrained optimization, and Kalman filtering.rnThe design process is not a trivial
  process by which features and models are chosen for integration such that the best
  possible prediction on RUL still is obtained. It takes substantial effort to design
  systems so that measured data can be fused and used in conjunction with physics-based
  models to estimate current and future damage states. This is exacerbated when multiple
  models are employed that may use different feature inputs. The prognosis system
  must also be capable of intelligently calibrating a priori initial conditions (e.g.,
  humidity, strain, and temperature) and random variable characteristics in an automated
  yet lucid process.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed\",\n\t\"extras\":
