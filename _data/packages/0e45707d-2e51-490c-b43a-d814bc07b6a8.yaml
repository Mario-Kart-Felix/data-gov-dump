    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Traditional photovoltaics are limited in
    two major ways: by the availability of light and the wavelengths that can be absorbed.
    Nighttime, seasons, and latitude limit the amount of radiation to absorb, and the
    available bandgap of materials for photovoltaic cells limits absorption to ?shortwave?
    radiation (near-IR wavelengths and shorter).  However, the Earth absorbs incident
    sunlight and re-emits the energy as ?longwave? blackbody radiation, peaking in the
    10 ?m wavelength range, known as ?earthglow? (as opposed to ?earthshine?, the visible
    light directly reflected by the Earth). Earthglow continues during nighttime, varying
    only about 25&#37; during a 24-hour period. It is difficult to harvest with traditional
    photovoltaics, but not  alternative radiant energy harvesting methods. An approach
    employing plasmonically-active nano-antennas offers a potential solution due to
    the tuneability of the resonant wavelength via antenna geometry.  The ultimate goal
    of this project is to produce nano-antennas able to rectify infrared optical energy
    (terahertz frequencies), such as earthglow, into DC electrical current. The concept
    of nano-antennas has been around for many years, but due to fabrication difficulties,
    researchers have only recently begun to actually demonstrate them in the lab. Theoretically,
    single-junction photovoltaics have a light-to-electricity conversion efficiency
    limit of around 30&#37;. Nano-antennas have a theoretical capture efficiency (incident
    light absorbed) of up to 95&#37;, with lab demonstrations reaching 80&#37;. The
    challenge facing researchers is converting this potential abundance of captured
    light efficiently into electricity, but nano-antennas promise a greater upper limit
    to energy production than present technology. Work on the energy harvesting project
    places NASA on the cutting edge of nano-antenna development. The design begins with
    an insulating substrate that is covered by a bottom electrode of metal film. ",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
