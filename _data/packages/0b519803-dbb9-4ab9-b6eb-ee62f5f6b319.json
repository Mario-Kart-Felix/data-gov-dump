	"notes": "State of the art Radiation Hardened by Design (RHBD) techniques do not account for wide temperature variations in BiCMOS process.  Silicon-Germanium BiCMOS process offer inherent advantages for operation in radiation environments where single event transient and total iodization dose effects on the circuit are important. Recent access to libraries of wide temperature and RHBD BiCMOS designs provide the reference data for developing radiation aware automation design automation. Lynguent's efficiency gains in compact model composition have enabled radiation domain experts to transfer observed radiation effects from TCAD simulators into the commercial circuit simulators. These compact models are augmented with radiation effects such as the ISDE 90 nm Bulk CMOS Bias Dependent Charge Sharing SET Effect. These rad-aware models are used within the LynRad Fault Analyzer, taking into account circuit schematics, layout and cosmic ray scenarios.  Extending this design automation to a BiCMOS AMS designs is the logical next step in establishing radiation awareness over wide temperature.  Previous investigations were limited to circuits with a small number of transistors that could be simulated in mixed TCAD-SPICE environments. Consequently, scaling the LynRad Radiation Fault Analyzer to larger, more complex AMS circuits is a key aspect of this investigation.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
