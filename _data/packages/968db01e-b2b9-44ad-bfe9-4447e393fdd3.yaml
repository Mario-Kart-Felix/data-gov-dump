    (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japan satellite mission to monitor tropical and subtropical
    precipitation and to estimate its associated latent heating. TRMM was successfully
    launched on November 27, at 4:27 PM (EST) from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan.nnThe
    TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) is a nine-channel passive microwave radiometer, which
    builds on the heritage of the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) instrument
    flown aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) platforms. Microwave
    radiation is emitted by the Earth&apos;s surface and by water droplets within clouds.
    However, when layers of large ice particles are present in upper cloud regions -
    a condition highly correlated with heavy rainfall - microwave radiation tends to
    scatter at frequencies above 19 GHz. The TMI detects radiation at five frequencies
    chosen to discriminate among these processes, thus revealing the likelihood of rainfall.
    The key to accurate retrieval of rainfall rates by this method is the deduction
    of cloud precipitation consistent with the radiation measurement at each frequency.
    The TMI frequencies are 10.65, 19.35, 37 and 85.5 GHz (dual polarization), and 21
    GHz (vertical polarization only).nnThe Level 1A product file (1A11) is a concatenation
    of the Level 0 data with a header record and, as such, is reversible to Level 0.
    The header record contains information pertaining to orbit times, orbit number,
    times of the first scan and number of scans, among other things. The Level 0 data
    contain the actual channel data expressed as &quot;sensor counts.&quot; A file contains
    data for a single orbit with a file size of about 7 MB (uncompressed).  There are
    16 files of TMI 1A11 data produced per day.nnSpatial coverage is between 38 degrees
    North and 38 degrees South owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite.
    This orbit provides extensive coverage in the tropics and allows each location to
    be covered at a different local time each day, enabling the analysis of the diurnal
    cycle of precipitation.nnFor more details including its format and header description,

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
