  2 panchromatic satellite imagery of Northeast Puerto Rico that contains the shallow
  water area (0-35m deep) surrounding Northeast Puerto Rico and Culebra Island. The
  WV2 imagery was processed using ArcGIS tools to cloudmask, deglint and water-column
  correct the image (Lyzenga method) then using PCI imagery analysis to create a continues,
  color balanced mosaic. The DigitalGlobe WV2 is a commercial high resolution (0.5m
  - 1.5m) multi-spectral satellite that surveyed the NEPR area in 2011-2013. The enhanced
  Red, Green, Blue and Near Infrared 1 bands allowed the Biogeography branch to delineate
  habitats using feature extraction tools in Envi 5.1 software. The multispectral
  bands were analyzed to detect coral reefs and seagrass beds under the surface of
  the water, as well as features above the surface, such as mangroves, salt ponds,
  and the shoreline edges. The WV2 mosaic, the bathymetry model, principle component
  analysis, and aerial imagery were all used integrally to create the NEPR Benthic
  Habitat Map.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\": \"bbox-east-long\",\n\t\t\"value\":
