	"notes": "During our Phase I STTR effort, Balcones Technologies, LLC and The University of Texas Center for Electromechanics (CEM) successfully achieved all Phase I objectives and developed a concept design for an active Vibration Isolation System (VIS) that fully meets all requirements defined or implied in STTR 2007-1 Subtopic T6.02.  Now the Balcones Technologies - CEM team proposes to develop, test, and deliver a prototype version of our active VIS.  Furthermore, the delivered prototype system, coupled with our proposed Phase II commercialization activities, will be substantially advanced from a proof-of-principle system and will embody the critical aspects of pre-production systems, ready to quickly transition to the NASA qualification process and finished product.rnrntOur Phase I effort yielded a high performance, cost effective, highly reliable, actively controlled Vibration Isolation System (VIS) for ground support electronics racks or groups of racks on the Mobile Launch Platform (MLP).  Some features are listed below.rn?tdoes not rely on predictable vibration inputrn?tapplies across broad range of ground support electronics or other sensitive systemsrn?tdoes not depend on detailed knowledge or testing of the components being protectedrn?tis compatible with operation from a self-contained power supply if desired by NASArn?toffers up to 18x reduction in payload peak accelerations compared to passive approaches and up to 5x reduction compared to semi-active approachesrn?tcan be configured to isolate electronics racks individually, in small groups, or via an isolation system for an entire floorrn?tis modular in both hardware and software, exploiting COTS and previously developed CEM technology to facilitate rapid development and commercializationrn?texploits approximately $24M of highly successful active suspension R&amp;D at CEM for military vehicles for the controls, architecture, and actuator development technology.rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
