    for model-based systems engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I), system health management
    (SHM)-related models will either be done in SysML, or be done outside of SysML but
    enabled by conversion, mapping, and traceability of information across SysML and
    SHM models. Given that current implementations of SysML are not particularly useful
    to perform analyses, and that SHM analyses are not identical to typical SE&amp;I-related
    analyses, there will need to be connectivity between SysML representations and SHM
    models that perform SHM-related analyses.rnrnQualtech Systems, Inc. (QSI), with
    Dr. Stephen Johnson as a consultant intends to explore and develop the integration
    of model-based systems engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) using SysML with system
    health management (SHM) modeling and analysis using QSI's Testability Engineering
    and Maintenance System (TEAMS). An overarching objective of this proposal is to
    reduce the duplicative and disjoint effort by NASA's subject matter experts in the
    development of systems engineering and design models as well as systems health management/fault
    management models. The intent is to leverage the success space or intent based system
    design models and transform them for developing fault management models and ensuring
    changes in design have a natural flow-through to the FM domain, thereby keeping
    FM models in sync with the design through a semi-automated process. This is one
    step in the larger set of issues that will need to be addressed in the development
    of the model-based Discipline of Systems Engineering and its concurrent integration
    with SHM to achieve higher-quality designs while reducing the costs of SE&amp;I.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
