  for the Long Term Resource Monitoring Program (LTRMP). In 2000, 1:16,000-scale true
  color aerial photos were collected on the Mississippi River from Cairo, IL to Minneapolis,
  MN and the on Illinois River from its confluence with the Mississippi near Grafton,
  IL to Lake Michigan/Chicago, IL. The photos were collected using a 60% stereo overlap
  between photos in the same flight line and a 30% overlap between flight lines. At
  the time this document was prepared, UMESC was in the process of scanning, georeferencing
  and compiled approximately every other photo into georeferenced mosaics for the
  navigation pools. These mosaics are served as compressed .sid images, so they'll
  be easier to download vial the Internet. Note: While the photos have been georeferenced,
  they have not been orthorectified.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"bd2cdd5a-4d65-46c0-9937-c8381175f104\",\n\t\"extras\":
