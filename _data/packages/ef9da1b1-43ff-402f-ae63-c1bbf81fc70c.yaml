  Slough National Wildlife Refuge in 1987, as a result of concern for pollution from
  a variety of potential sources. To assess the impacts of contaminants on the refuge
  and particularly the endangered lightfooted clapper rail, a variety of biota was
  collected in sample locations throughout the Tijuana River Valley. A brief summary
  of analytical results is given in both a narrative form (below) and graphic/tabular
  form (attached). Results from 1987 indicated that 5 organochlorine chlorine pesticides
  were present in biota. DDT and its metabolites (DDE were found in all samples with
  concentrations as high as 1.03 parts per millions (ppm). This, however, is below
  concentration levels known to cause eggshell thinning in birds. Polycyclic aromatic
  hydrocarbons (PAH's) were only present in a few samples, and found at low levels.
  PCBs were not detected in any samples. 1988 results indicated a decrease in the
  presence of DDT (58% of samples). The maximum concentration was below any biologically
  significant threshold. PCBs were present but at low levels. This may have been due
  to an increase in the sensitivity of the analysis. PAH's were only found in a few
  biological samples, however, not at significant levels. A sediment sample from the
  storm drain off of 3rd Street in Imperial Beach did have a considerate number of
  PAHs including a carcinogen, Benzo (a) pyrene at 0.23 ppm. A significant finding
  from the 1988 data showed Aliphatic hydrocarbons (Petroleum) to be accumulating
  in Ghost shrimp and a clapper rail egg. Concentrations in the rail egg for N-C'5,
  N-C'6, N-C19, and N-C20 were comparable to eggs laid by a female mallard fed 2.5%
  oil. It is not known what the effect of this contamination is at this time. There
  are several possible sources of petroleum pollution in the Tijuana River Valley.
  Length and duration of oil exposure to biota can be determined by ratios of pristane
  to N-C17 and phytane to N-C18. High ratios (<2) indicate a long term (chronic) expose
  and low ratios a short exposure (acute). Ghost shrimp exhibited a high ratio, the
  rail egg a low ratio. Further information will be needed to assess oil exposure
  of biota. Sampling strategy for 1989 was based on analytical results from the previous
  two years. The major concern was presence of OCs (particularly DDT and metabolites)
  and Aliphatic hydrocarbons in biota. Sampling was conducted to ascertain aerial
  deposition, or point sources (both from Mexico and U.S.), within the Tijuana River
  watershed. Sampling was also conducted to determine the extent of OC contamination.
  The scope of work was expanded in 1989 to include a baseline contaminate study at
  the Sweetwater Marsh NWR. Seven stations were established throughout the refuge
  to assess if any contaminant problems exist. Because of the volume information generated
  trace metal analytical data are currently being analyzed using a Statgraphics computer
  program. Preliminary screening indicates no significant problems but addition analysis
  is needed for confirmation. Study design for 1990 will be based on results from
  1989. Sampling in Tijuana River and Sweetwater NWR will be conducted in the spring
  and summer of 1990. A formal report on contaminant issues within Tijuana River or
  Sweetwater NWR will be written after receipt of 1990 data, expected in spring of
  1991. If necessary, any significant contaminant issues will be reported sooner.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
