	"notes": "_Abstract:_  Monthly and annual average solar resource potential for the lower 48 statesrnrnrnrn_Purpose:_  Provide information on the solar resource potential for the lower 48 states. The insolation values represent the average solar energy available to a horizontal flat plate collector.rnrnrnrn_Supplemental Information:_  This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of approximatley 40 km by 40 km in size. This data was developed from the Climatological Solar Radiation (CSR) Model. The CSR model was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Maxwell, George and Wilcox (1998) and George and Maxwell (1999). This model uses information on cloud cover, atmostpheric water vapor and trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the monthly average daily total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The cloud cover data used as input to the CSR model are an 7-year histogram (1985-1991) of monthly average cloud fraction provided for grid cells of approximately 40km x 40km in size. Thus, the spatial resolution of the CSR model output is defined by this database. The data are obtained from the National Climatic Data Center in Ashville, North Carolina, and were developed from the U.S. Air Force Real Time Nephanalysis (RTNEPH) program. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. The procedures for converting the collector at latitude tilt are described in Marion and Wilcox (1994). Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meterological input to the model, since some of the input parameters are not avalible at a 40km resolution. As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately 10% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other micoclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain. rnrnFurther information can be found in the publication found at [this web site] (http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/pubs/redbook).rnrn### License InfornDISCLAIMER NOTICErnThis GIS data was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ("NREL"), which is operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE").
