	"notes": "X-ray microcalorimeters have developed to provide unprecedented energy resolution and signal sensitivity. To take maximum advantage of the microcalorimeter's performance, a new and improved blocking filter stack is needed to further enhance low level sensitivity and mission throughput. The innovation proposed, high transmission polyimide support mesh fabricated using photolithography, will replace the nickel mesh used in previous blocking filter designs. The proposed mesh will be thinner than known comparable supports and will be produced freestanding such that it can be readily combined with filter foils of all types. The polyimide mesh will demonstrate at least 10&#37; higher transmission than nickel at all energies, and will become essentially transparent above 3 keV. Mesh structures will be fabricated using three different photolithographic processes and compared both freestanding and in combination with filter foils to determine feasibility. The proposed innovation along with thinner materials will improve mission throughput and effective area significantly for microcalorimeter payloads on proposed Small Explorer missions, NeXT, and Spectrum-X-Gamma in the near term as well as Constellation ?X.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
