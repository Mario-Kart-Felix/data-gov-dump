    Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, from 16 October - 14 November 2008, reef fish assessment surveys
    were conducted, as a part of Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA), during the Pacific
    Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruise OES0810 in the Main Hawaiian
    Islands at biennial intervals by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the
    NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). During the cruise, 24 REA
    sites were surveyed at Kauai Island in the Main Hawaiian Islands. At the specific
    REA sites, fish biologists along with coral biologists, algal biologists and marine
    invertebrate zoologist entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~300 m2) and
    high degree of taxonomic resolution REA survey to assess and monitor species composition,
    abundance, percent cover, size distribution, diversity, and general health of fish,
    corals, macro-invertebrates, and algae in shallow-water (< 35 m) habitats. Reef
    fish assessment surveys were focused on cataloging the diversity (species richness),
    abundance (numeric density [# fish 100 m-2] and biomass density [kg 100 m-2]) of
    diurnally active reef fish assemblages. Three complementary noninvasive underwater
    survey methods were used, including belt-transect, stationary point count, and roving-diver
    surveys. For all methods, fish were identified at the species level, when possible,
    and assigned to a size bin ranging from 1 to 200 cm based on a visual estimate of
    total fish length. Belt-transect (BLT) surveys were used to quantify the entire
    diurnal fish community (all size classes). In belt-transect surveys, two fish biologists
    swam side-by-side along three consecutively-placed, 25m transect lines. The BLT
    team swam each transect two times. During the initial swim-out, each fish diver
    recorded all fish larger than 20 cm observed within a 4-m wide belt perpendicular
    to their respective side of the transect (200 m2 area per line, 100 m2 per diver).
    On the return swim, each fish diver recorded all fish less than 20 cm observed within
    a 2-m wide belt (100 m2 area per line, 50 m2 per diver). The survey of large fish
    took approximately 5 min to complete while the survey of smaller fish took about
    10 min to complete. All reef-associated fish, including those in the water column
    (including planktivores), were counted. Any coastal pelagic species (e.g., clupeids
    [sardines], belonids [beakfish], antherinids [silversides]) seen near the surface
    were not recorded. The stationary point count (SPC) method were used to quantify
    larger, more mobile reef fish species that can be missed on belt-transect surveys.
    In stationary point count survey, a fish biologist swam approximately 15 m away
    from a transect line concurrently being surveyed by the other two BLT fish biologists.
    The SPC biologist then recorded all fish greater than 25 cm in length that passed
    within a visually estimated 20-m diameter cylinder centered on the diver's fixed
    position (10-m radius, total area = 314 m2). The survey time for each stationary
    point count survey was 5 min and a total of four stationary point count surveys
    were conducted at each REA site. Roving-diver surveys were followed belt-transect
    and stationary point count surveys. As diver bottom time permitted, the fish assessment
    team conducted random swim surveys throughout the REA site area, recording, to the
    species level or the lowest recognizable taxon, the presence of reef fish not encountered
    during previous methods.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
