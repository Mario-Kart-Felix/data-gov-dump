    the military and civilian sectors are becoming major issues as the existing fleet
    continues to age.  Additionally, the increased use of composite structures in the
    civilian fleet, such as in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A380, make the
    understanding and/or improvement of composite durability, particularly durability
    of repairs, even more critical.  Several areas have been identified as targets for
    improvement in composite aircraft repair.  These include the development of rapid,
    low temperature repair methods and associated materials as well as development of
    the quality of repairs when they are made.  Adhesion of bonded repairs is one area
    that needs to be addressed. rnIn the Phase I program Adherent Technologies, Inc.
    demonstrated a novel moisture-resistant primer system for use in repairs of standard
    carbon/epoxy composites used in many subsonic aircraft.  Our proprietary chemistry
    comprised of a reactive coupling agent and a carrier resin compatible with standard
    aerospace epoxy resins bonds directly to the prepared aircraft composite surface
    while retaining residual functionality that can be cured directly into the matrix
    of the repair leading to a covalently bound repair, thereby strengthening the repair
    interface.  An increase in bond strength for primed samples relative to unprimed
    control specimens was noted; the improvement in the fracture toughness of the bonds
    was particularly of note.rnThe Phase II effort will focus on the optimization of
    these primer systems and associated application and activation methods.  Water-based
    systems will also be developed and demonstrated.rn",nt"license_title": "U.S.

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
