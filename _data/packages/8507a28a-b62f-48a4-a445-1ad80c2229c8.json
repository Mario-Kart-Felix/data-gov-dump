	"notes": "Bridges-Rail in the United States According to The National Bridge Inspection Standards published in the Code of Federal Regulations (23 CFR 650.3), a bridge isA structure including supports erected over a depression or an obstruction, such as water, highway, or railway, and having a track or passageway for carrying traffic or other moving loads. Each bridge was captured as a point which was placed in the center of the 'main span' (highest and longest span). For bridges that cross navigable waterways, this was typically the part of the bridge over the navigation channel. If no 'main span' was discernable using the imagery sources available, or if multiple non contiguous main spans were discernable, the point was placed in the center of the overall structure. Bridges that are sourced from the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) that cross state boundaries are an exception. Bridges that cross state boundaries are represented in the NBI by two records. The points for the two records have been located so as to be within the state indicated by the NBI's [STATE_CODE] attribute. In some cases, following these rules did not place the point at the location at which the bridge crosses what the user may judge as the most important feature intersected. For example, a given bridge may be many miles long, crossing nothing more than low lying ground for most of its length but crossing a major interstate at its far end. Due to the fact that bridges are often high narrow structures crossing depressions that may or may not be too narrow to be represented in the DEM used to orthorectify a given source of imagery, alignment with ortho imagery is highly variable. In particular, apparent bridge location in ortho imagery is highly dependent on collection angle. During verification, TechniGraphics used imagery from the following sourcesNGA HSIP 133 City, State or Local; NAIP; DOQQ imagery. In cases where 'bridge sway' or 'tall structure lean' was evident, TGS attempted to compensate for these factors when capturing the bridge location. For instances in which the bridge was not visible in imagery, it was captured using topographic maps at the intersection of the water and rail line. TGS processed 784 entities previously with the HSIP Bridges-Roads (STRAHNET Option - HSIP 133 Cities and Gulf Coast). These entities were added into this dataset after processing. No entities were included in this dataset for American Samoa, Guam, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands because there are no main line railways in these areas. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, leading and trailing spaces were trimmed from all text fields. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is given by the publication date which is 09/02/2009. A more precise measure of currentness cannot be provided since this is dependent on the NBI and the source of imagery used during processing.",
