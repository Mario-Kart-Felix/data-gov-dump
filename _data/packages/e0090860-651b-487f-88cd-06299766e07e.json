	"notes": "Samples of liver and kidney were collected from 170 Pacific walruses by Alaskan native hunters, preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 microns, and stained routinely with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic examination. Additionally, levels of 20 metals were determined in liver and kidney of 75 of these walruses by others. Liver and kidney of the 170 walrus were examined histologically in order to determine whether or not morphologic evidence of metal toxicity was present. All tissue abnormalities were recorded in the form of morphologic diagnoses. Several limitations are inherent in this study. These samples were collected after the walruses were killed by Alaskan native subsistence hunters. These wild animals are subject to many diverse, unknown influences over the courses of their lives. They are of varying ages and are presumed to be genetically diverse. The samples were collected from various regions of the two organs. Thus, many factors that are controlled in typical toxicologic/histopathologic studies in a laboratory setting could not be controlled. Also, the normal histologic variations found in liver and kidney of walruses are not well known. As free-living nondomestic animals, parasitism and infectious diseases are likely to be relatively common. A classical control group composed of walruses not exposed to the metals in question but otherwise similar to the metals-exposed group was not available. Nevertheless, the toxic effects of the metals in question on mammalian liver and kidney have been generally well documented and would be expected to be similar in walruses. It is reasonable to compare histologic findings in tissues from walruses with high levels of metals to those with low levels to determine whether or not clear differences are present. Thus, reasonable inferences can be drawn from this study.",
