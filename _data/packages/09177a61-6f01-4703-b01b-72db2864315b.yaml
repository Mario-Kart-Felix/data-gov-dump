    (.txt format). One file provides stand characteristics, biomass, and production
    allocation data for an old-growth boreal forest near Kuusamo, Finland. The research
    was conducted during the 1967-1972 growing seasons. The other two files provide
    climate data from a weather station about 60 km south of the forest. One record
    contains precipitation and mean average temperature data for the 1961-1994 period
    (excluding 1971-1980) and the other contains precipitation data for 1908-1994. The
    Kuusamo research site is located just south of the Arctic Circle (66.37 N 29.32
    E) and belongs to the northern boreal zone of taiga forests. The forest is an old
    Hylocomium-Myrtillus type spruce forest which has remained in a natural state and
    reached climatic climax long ago. The average age of the dominant spruces (Picea
    abies) is about 260 years. There is a well-developed ground layer of vegetation,
    chiefly dwarf scrub and mosses (dominant species: Vaccinium myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea,
    Hylocomium splendens, and Pleurozium schreberi). The northerly location of the forest
    and the age of its trees are the main factors responsible for low biomass and net
    production figures in comparison with spruce forests further south. Total above-ground
    biomass (including tree, understory, and moss layers) was determined by harvest
    methods and estimated to be 10,194 g/m2. Below-ground tree biomass estimates, also
    determined by harvest methods, are less reliable, at 3,753 g/m2. Total net primary
    productivity (NPP) for this site was estimated to be 441 g/m2/yr (421 g/m2/yr above-ground,
    20 g/m2/yr below-ground).",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
