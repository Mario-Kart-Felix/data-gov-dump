    The AMP was initially being developed as part the Advanced Integrated Clinical System
    (AICS)-Guided Medical Procedure System for the Constellation Program. The Exploration
    Medical Capability (ExMC) team generated an Operational Concept (OpsCon) document
    and, subsequently, a set of functional and technical requirements. All of these
    documents were reviewed and approved by the Johnson Space Center Space Medicine
    Configuration Control Board in 2009 and 2010, respectively. These documents were
    then archived when the Constellation Program was canceled in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiscal
    Year 2012 (FY12) brought the start of the EMSD project and the initial development
    of the AMP. ExMC generated a new OpsCon document for the AMP to reflect how it would
    be used for the EMSD. This document was approved by the ExMC Advisory Board and
    then used to generate functional and technical requirements. These requirements
    were reviewed by the ExMC Advisory Board and during the EMSD&amp;rsquo;s System
    Requirements Review in March 2012. The ExMC Team then used the finalized requirements
    to determine that a product made by software developers within NASA was applicable.
    The product, a system called WebPD, has architecture relevant to the EMSD project
    and is being modified for integration with potential EMSD components. The approach
    for modifying and integrating the AMP into the EMSD was finalized during the EMSD
    Preliminary Design Review in June 2013. The AMP, along with other EMSD components,
    is being prepared for the ground phase of the EMSD, which is currently set for June
    2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The work by the
    ExMC team over the past year has enabled them to (1) identify a software system
    that can be modified to become the AMP system for the EMSD and (2) begin modifying
    the AMP for integration with other EMSD components. This work immediately addresses
    CPR Risks #17 and #23 and enables ExMC to better address CPR Risks #17, #20, #22,
    and #23 in the coming fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
    objectives for FY14 are to (1) generate the first iteration of the AMP and (2) conduct
    an evaluation of this AMP&amp;rsquo;s capability in an analog environment that mimics
    an exploration-class mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
