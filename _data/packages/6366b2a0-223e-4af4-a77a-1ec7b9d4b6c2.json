	"notes": "This study was designed to determine if the use of agricultural pesticides and herbicides used in rice farming and Chinese tallow tree control have a noticeable effect on populations of amphibians on the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge. Two hour searches by a two person team were conducted along specific transects in a moist soil management unit, rice fields, and fallowed rice fields, twice a month between March and July, and once a month between August and November for two years. All amphibians seen or heard were recorded, or captured when possible, and examined for gross malformations. Small dip nets were used to collect tadpoles for external examination and growth observations. Three herbicides [Stam M-4 (propanil), Grazon P+D (picloram + 2,4-D) and Arrosolo (propanil + molinate)] that were approved for use, and used on the Refuge during the study, were tested for toxicity in the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay - Xenopus (FETAX) of these chemicals to larval amphibians. Dose-response curves are presented and the LC50s were calculated for Grazon P+D and Arrosolo (33% propanil, 33% molinate). Stam M-4 did not yield a definitive test. The LC50 for Grazon P+D was between 25 and 50 mg/L and for Arrosolo the LC50 was 13.5 mg/L. Calculated exposure concentration of Arrosolo used in rice farming on the Refuge was less than 0.6 mg/L, which is 200 times lower than the LC50 determined in the FETAX assay. Fourteen species of frogs, toads and salamanders were recorded on the Refuge during this study. Three species (three-toed amphiuma, western lesser siren and pig frog) were not previously recorded in Chambers County, Texas. Six species of amphibians recorded from Chambers County (Dixon 1987) were not seen during this study (Table 1). In August the moist soil management unit generally contained the largest population of amphibians averaging 26 individuals per hectare and represented 10 species. The rice fields had the second largest population of amphibians and averaged 24 individuals per hectare, representing 11 species, during July. The rice field was usually drained and left to dry out in August for harvesting. The fallowed rice fields had only eight species of amphibians and much lower densities. These fields were not flooded and stayed dry for long time periods during the drought period of 1999 and 2000. Surveys in the months of December, January, or February did not yield any amphibians along the transects. There were no malformed frogs, toads or tadpoles collected during this study which indicates that the herbicides currently used on the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge are not having a measurable adverse effect on the amphibian populations. Habitat alteration such as discing, leveling, and terracing the area for rice planting appeared to have a large but short-term negative effect on the presence, reproduction and abundance of amphibians. The role of concentrating predators such as birds, snakes and mammals, in the moist soil unit and the rice fields on the amphibian populations was not evaluated, but appears as if it could be substantial.",
