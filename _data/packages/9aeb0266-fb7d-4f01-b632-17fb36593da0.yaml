    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "To support a long-term NOAA Coral Reef
    Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, from 15 April - 7 May 2009, reef fish assessment surveys were conducted,
    as a part of Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA), during the Pacific Reef Assessment
    and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruise HI0903 in the Marianas Archipelago at biennial
    intervals by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands
    Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). During the cruise, 1 REA sites were surveyed at
    Zealandia Bank in the Marianas Archipelago. At the specific REA sites, fish biologists
    along with coral biologists, algal biologists and marine invertebrate zoologist
    entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~300 m2) and high degree of taxonomic
    resolution REA survey to assess and monitor species composition, abundance, percent
    cover, size distribution, diversity, and general health of fish, corals, macro-invertebrates,
    and algae in shallow-water (< 35 m) habitats. Reef fish assessment surveys were
    focused on cataloging the diversity (species richness), abundance (numeric density
    [# fish 100 m-2] and biomass density [kg 100 m-2]) of diurnally active reef fish
    assemblages. Three complementary noninvasive underwater survey methods were used,
    including belt-transect, stationary point count, and roving-diver surveys. For all
    methods, fish were identified at the species level, when possible, and assigned
    to a size bin ranging from 1 to 200 cm based on a visual estimate of total fish
    length. Belt-transect (BLT) surveys were used to quantify the entire diurnal fish
    community (all size classes). In belt-transect surveys, two fish biologists swam
    side-by-side along three consecutively-placed, 25m transect lines. The BLT team
    swam each transect two times. During the initial swim-out, each fish diver recorded
    all fish larger than 20 cm observed within a 4-m wide belt perpendicular to their
    respective side of the transect (200 m2 area per line, 100 m2 per diver). On the
    return swim, each fish diver recorded all fish less than 20 cm observed within a
    2-m wide belt (100 m2 area per line, 50 m2 per diver). The survey of large fish
    took approximately 5 min to complete while the survey of smaller fish took about
    10 min to complete. All reef-associated fish, including those in the water column
    (including planktivores), were counted. Any coastal pelagic species (e.g., clupeids
    [sardines], belonids [beakfish], antherinids [silversides]) seen near the surface
    were not recorded. The stationary point count (SPC) method were used to quantify
    larger, more mobile reef fish species that can be missed on belt-transect surveys.
    In stationary point count survey, a fish biologist swam approximately 15 m away
    from a transect line concurrently being surveyed by the other two BLT fish biologists.
    The SPC biologist then recorded all fish greater than 25 cm in length that passed
    within a visually estimated 20-m diameter cylinder centered on the diver's fixed
    position (10-m radius, total area = 314 m2). The survey time for each stationary
    point count survey was 5 min and a total of four stationary point count surveys
    were conducted at each REA site. Roving-diver surveys were followed belt-transect
    and stationary point count surveys. As diver bottom time permitted, the fish assessment
    team conducted random swim surveys throughout the REA site area, recording, to the
    species level or the lowest recognizable taxon, the presence of reef fish not encountered
    during previous methods.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
