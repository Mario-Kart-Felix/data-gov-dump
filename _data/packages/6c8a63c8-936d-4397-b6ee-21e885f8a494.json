	"notes": "Software Health Management (SWHM) is a new field that is concerned with the development of tools and technologies to enable automated detection, diagnosis, prediction, and mitigation of adverse events due to software anomalies.rnSignificant effort has been expended in the last several decades in therndevelopment of verification and validation methods for softwarernintensive systems, but it is becoming increasingly more apparent that this isrnnot enough to guarantee that a complex software systemrnmeets all safety and reliability requirements. rnrnModern software systems can exhibit a variety of failure modes which can go undetected in a verification and validation process.  While standard techniques for error handling, fault detection and isolationrncan have significant benefits for many systems, it is becoming increasingly evident that new technologies and methods are necessary for the development of techniques to detect, diagnose, predict, and then mitigate the adverse events due to software that has already undergone significant verification and validation procedures.rnThese software faults often arise due to the interaction between the softwarernand the operating environment.rnUnanticipated environmental changes lead to software anomalies that may have significant impact on the overall success of the mission.rnBecause software is ubiquitous, it is not sufficient that errors arerndetected only after they occur. Rather, software must be instrumented andrnmonitored for failures before they happen.rnThis prognostic capability will yield safer and more dependable systems for the future.  This paper addresses the motivation, needs, and requirements of software health management as a new discipline.rnrnPublished in the Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Space Mission Challenges for Information Technology, Palo Alto, CA, August 2011.

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
