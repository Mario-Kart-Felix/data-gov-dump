    within the same census tract. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs
    aren               uniquely numbered within census tracts. BGs have a valid code
    range of 0 through 9. BGs have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block
    numbern               from the same decennial census. For example, tabulation blocks
    numbered 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within census tract 1210.02 are also within BG
    3 withinn               that census tract. BGs coded 0 are intended to only include
    water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water,
    andn               Great Lakes water areas. Block groups generally contain between
    600 and 3,000 people. A BG usually covers a contiguous area but never crosses county
    orn               census tract boundaries. They may, however, cross the boundaries
    of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, votingn
                  districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska
    Native / Native Hawaiian areas. The BG boundaries in this release are those that
    weren               delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical
    Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census. ",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
