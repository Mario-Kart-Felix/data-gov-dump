    the health of rotating engine components are becoming increasingly attractive options
    to aircraft engine companies in order to increase safety of operation and lower
    maintenance costs. Health monitoring remains a challenging feature to easily implement,
    especially, in the presence of scattered loading conditions, crack size, component
    geometry and materials properties. The current trend, however, is to utilize noninvasive
    types of health monitoring or nondestructive techniques to detect hidden flaws and
    mini cracks before any catastrophic event occurs. These techniques go further to
    evaluate materials' discontinuities and other anomalies that have grown to the level
    of critical defects which can lead to failure. Generally, health monitoring is highly
    dependent on sensor systems that are capable of performing in various engine environmental
    conditions and able to transmit a signal upon a predetermined crack length, while
    acting in a neutral form upon the overall performance of the engine system. Efforts
    are under way at NASA Glenn Research Center through support of the Intelligent Vehicle
    Health Management Project (IVHM) to develop and implement such sensor technology
    for a wide variety of applications [1-5]. These efforts are focused on developing
    high temperature, wireless, low cost and durable products.Therefore, in an effort
    to address the technical issues concerning health monitoring of a rotor disk, this
    paper considers data collected from an experimental study using high frequency capacitive
    sensor technology to capture blade tip clearance and tip timing measurements in
    a rotating engine-like-disk-to predict the disk faults and assess its structural
    integrity. The experimental results collected at a range of rotational speeds from
    tests conducted at the NASA Glenn Research Center's Rotordynamics Laboratory will
    be evaluated using multiple data-driven anomaly detection techniques [6-9] to identify
    anomalies in the disk. This study is expected to present a select evaluation of
    online health monitoring of a rotating disk using these high caliber sensors and
    test the capability of the in-house spin system.",nt"license_title": "U.S.

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
