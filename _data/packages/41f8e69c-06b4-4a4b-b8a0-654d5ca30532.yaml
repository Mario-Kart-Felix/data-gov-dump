    null,nt"notes": "The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files
    (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from
    the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
    Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless
    national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File
    is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to
    cover the entire nation. The primary legal divisions of most States are termed counties.
    In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties,
    the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, and municipalities,
    and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively
    for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four States
    (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places
    that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions
    of their States. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are
    treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of
    Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent
    entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following
    entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios
    in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth
    of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire
    area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties
    or equivalent entities. The 2010 Census boundaries for counties and equivalent entities
    are as of January 1, 2010, primarily as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary
    and Annexation Survey (BAS).<br /><br /> This table contains data on educational
    attainment from the American Community Survey 2006-2010 database for counties. The
    American Community Survey (ACS) is a household survey conducted by the U.S. Census
    Bureau that currently has an annual sample size of about 3.5 million addresses.
    ACS estimates provides communities with the current information they need to plan
    investments and services. Information from the survey generates estimates that help
    determine how more than $400 billion in federal and state funds are distributed
    annually. Each year the survey produces data that cover the periods of 1-year, 3-year,
    and 5-year estimates for geographic areas in the United States and Puerto Rico,
    ranging from neighborhoods to Congressional districts to the entire nation. This
    table also has a companion table (Same table name with MOE Suffix) with the margin
    of error (MOE) values for each estimated element. MOE is expressed as a measure
    value for each estimated element. So a value of 25 and an MOE of 5 means 25 +/-
    5 (or statistical certainty between 20 and 30). There are also special cases of
    MOE. An MOE of -1 means the associated estimates do not have a measured error. An
    MOE of 0 means that error calculation is not appropriate for the associated value.
    An MOE of 109 is set whenever an estimate value is 0. The MOEs of aggregated elements
    and percentages must be calculated. This process means using standard error calculations
    as described in "American Community Survey Multiyear Accuracy of the Data (3-year
    2008-2010 and 5-year 2006-2010)". Also, following Census guidelines, aggregated
    MOEs do not use more than 1 0-element MOE (109) to prevent over estimation of the
    error. Due to the complexity of the calculations, some percentage MOEs cannot be
    calculated (these are set to null in the summary-level MOE tables).<br /><br />
    The name for table 'ACS10EDUCNTYMOE' was added as a prefix to all field names imported
    from that table. Be sure to turn off 'Show Field Aliases' to see complete field
    names in the Attribute Table of this feature layer. This can be done in the 'Table
    Options' drop-down menu in the Attribute Table or with key sequence '[CTRL]+[SHIFT]+N'.
    Due to database restrictions, the prefix may have been abbreviated if the field
    name exceded the maximum allowed characters.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
