    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience

    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The Integrated Biosphere Simulator (or IBIS)
    is designed to be a comprehensive model of the terrestrial biosphere. Tthe model
    represents a wide range of processes, including land surface physics, canopy physiology,
    plant phenology, vegetation dynamics and competition, and carbon and nutrient cycling.
    The model generates global simulations of the surface water balance (e.g., runoff),
    the terrestrial carbon balance (e.g., net primary production, net ecosystem exchange,
    soil carbon, aboveground and belowground litter, and soil CO2 fluxes), and vegetation
    structure (e.g., biomass, leaf area index, and vegetation composition). IBIS was
    developed by Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment (SAGE) researchers
    as a first step toward gaining an improved understanding of global biospheric processes
    and studying their potential response to human activity  [Foley et al. 1996].  IBIS
    was constructed to explicitly link land surface and hydrological processes, terrestrial
    biogeochemical cycles, and vegetation dynamics within a single, physically consistent
    framework. Furthermore, IBIS was one of a new generation of global biosphere models,
    termed Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (or DGVMs), that consider transient changes
    in vegetation composition and structure in response to environmental change. Previous
    global ecosystem models have typically focused on the equilibrium state of vegetation
    and could not allow vegetation patterns to change over time. Version 2.5 of IBIS
    includes several major improvements and additions [Kucharik et al. 2000]. SAGE continues
    to test the performance of the model, assembling a wide range of continental- and
    global-scale data, including measurements of river discharge, net primary production,
    vegetation structure, root biomass, soil carbon, litter carbon, and soil CO2 flux.
    Using these field data and model results for the contemporary biosphere (1965-1994),
    their evaluation shows that simulated patterns of runoff, NPP, biomass, leaf area
    index, soil carbon, and total soil CO2 flux agreed reasonably well with measurements
    that have been compiled from numerous ecosystems. These results also compare favorably
    to other global model results [Kucharik et al. 2000].",nt"owner_org": "d8a6202b-c0c3-463d-88a0-3bc021a178ed",nt"extras":
