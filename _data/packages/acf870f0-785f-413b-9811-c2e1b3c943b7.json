Robust and productive smallrnrobots enable mining rich and accessible deposits of ice and otherrnvolatiles buried near craters at the lunar poles, delivering resources tornproduce propellant, and thus making space exploration sustainable. rnLightweight excavators bridge the gap between prospecting and full-scalernISRU.rnrnA lightweight robot is proposed that excavates and delivers regolith withrnproduction so superior to the state of the art as to enable realisticrnlunar and planetary applications.  Demonstration of light weight will bernachieved by operating a low mass robot in Earth gravity reduced 5/6 byrnoffloading.rnrnThe significance of the proposed innovation is an approach that not onlyrnperforms the required tasks but is low in mass (30 kg to 150 kg).  Massrnconstraints make productive excavation challenging.  However, innovativerndesigns incorporating transverse bucket-wheels, high payload compositerndump beds, and high-speed driving are game changers, enabling regolithrnoperations in low gravity.  Phase 1 experimental results show that payloadrnratio and driving speed govern productivity of small robots.rnrnPhase 2 will elevate TRLs from 3 at the beginning to an estimated 4 or 5rnat end of contract.rnrn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
