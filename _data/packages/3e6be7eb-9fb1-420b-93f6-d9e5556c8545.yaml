    in the State of New Jersey averaged 1.38 fledglings per active nest from 1979 to
    1988. The Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge's (NWR) Barnegat eyrie failed
    to produce a single fledgling during this period, despite consistent nesting attempts.
    Poor reproductive performance at the Barnegat eyrie prompted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
    Service and the New Jersey Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife to investigate potential
    interaction between contaminants and peregrine falcon reproductive performance.
    The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that TCDD equivalent concentrations
    (TEQs) of planar PCB congeners, PCDDs, and PCDFs are higher in eggs from eyries
    exhibiting low productivity. In addition, other organochlorines and inorganic contaminants
    were examined as potential contributors to reproductive risks. Non-viable eggs from
    the Edwin B. Forsythe NWR and seven other New Jersey eyries were analyzed for planar
    PCB congeners, PCDDs, PCDFs, inorganics, and organochlorine pesticides. Reproductive
    data were summarized to evaluate the relationship between the levels of contaminants
    in peregrine falcon eggs and productivity. Non-ortho PCBs (specifically PCB 77 and
    PCB 126) were present at elevated levels in Atlantic coast eggs relative to those
    of the Delaware River. Based on TEQs, non-ortho PCBs (PCB 77 and PCB 126) were the
    most likely contributors to observed hatching failure on the Atlantic coast. Based
    on a raptor-specific reference toxicity value, levels of PCB 126 alone were sufficient
    to impact hatching success in all Atlantic coast nests, but not Delaware River nests.
    Total TEQ concentrations on the Atlantic coast of New Jersey were among the highest
    ever documented in eggs of this species (318 to 757 pg/g fresh weight). These findings
    contrast with those of the Delaware River eyries where total TEQ concentrations
    (90 to 175 pg/g) were generally below levels of concern. It is evident that the
    congener profiles in the Atlantic coast eggs were substantially different from those
    of the Delaware River. Concentrations of mercury and DDE were also detected in some
    eggs at levels which may adversely affect peregrine falcon reproductive success.
    The mean mercury concentration at Atlantic coast eyries (0.38 ug/g fresh weight)
    was more than 30 times greater than that at Delaware River eyries (0.012 ug/g).
    The DDE concentration at some eyries indicated that DDE may continue to be a reproductive
    hazard for some of these birds (maximum of 24.2 ug/g at the Tuckahoe nest). While
    detected concentrations of PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs, DDE, and mercury in many eggs were
    theoretically sufficient to impact peregrine falcon reproduction, the productivity
    and eggshell thinning data do not support a conclusion of reproductive impairment
    in New Jersey peregrine falcons due to contaminants. Multiple regression analysis
    revealed no correlation between concentrations of DDE, PCB 77, PCB 126, total PCBs,
    and total TEQs in eggs and eggshell thickness data from the same eggs. If contaminants
    are impacting reproduction, the effect is minor when compared to influences such
    as nest locations (bridge vs. tower), disturbance, predation, etc., and would probably
    be undetectable at the sample sizes involved in this study. Further congener-specific
    organochlorine and inorganic monitoring of peregrines, their prey and supporting
    food chain is recommended to identify exposure pathways and elucidate reasons for
    the large differences in exposure between Atlantic coast and Delaware River eyries.",nt"license_title":
