    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;rntHigh-altitude balloon flights
    are an inexpensive method used to lift payloads to high altitudes. Federal Aviation
    Administration (FAA) regulations permit payloads of up to 6 lbs without requiring
    any waivers or special permissions. Using such a balloon flight capability, the
    Rocket University program at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has collaborated with the
    Johnson Space Center (JSC) to perform test flights of a sub-scale version of the
    Maraia Entry Capsule. The Maraia Capsule is envisioned as an entry technology testbed
    that could be adapted to return small payloads (10-100&amp;rsquo;s of kg) from the
    International Space Station (ISS) or from beyond Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) destinations.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntThe
    main test objective is to gain insight into the aerodynamic and dynamic properties
    of the capsule in the subsonic regime. The capsule has been scaled accordingly,
    resulting in a test article 10&amp;rdquo; in diameter by approximately 6.5&amp;rdquo;
    tall at the 6 lb weight limit. Secondary test objectives include testing subsystems
    (e.g. avionics, parachutes, and guidance, navigation, and control (GN&amp;amp;C)
    subsystems) planned for use in future larger scale flights, as well as training
    and gaining overall experience in all aspects of designing, developing, and testing
    spaceflight systems.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rnt&lt;em&gt;A priori&lt;/em&gt; winds
    and trajectory predictions are used to determine a launch location such that the
    trajectory and predicted landing location is desirable for safety and recovery purposes.
    The balloon is filled on the ground and payload lines are laid along the predominant
    ground wind direction. The system is launched from a large open area in order to
    minimize the risk of entanglement and jerking of the lines and payloads.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntThe
    balloon ascends for one to two hours, depending on payload mass and fill volume.
    Once above an altitude of 70,000 ft, a release command is issued when trajectory
    predictions show that the capsule will land within the landing zone (or when they
    are closest to the zone, based on real-time trends). The capsule descends in freefall
    to 50,000 ft, at which point an autonomous command is sent to deploy the parachute.
    The ground operator may also manually issue a parachute deploy command at any time.
    The capsule then descends and lands, with an approximate terminal velocity of 38
    ft/s.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntA separate release command is issued for the Rocket
    University payload, which contains its own avionics, when landing predictions are
    such that it is desirable for the payload to separate from the balloon and land.
    (Note: on Flight #1, this command was issued simultaneously for both payloads. Future
    flights will permit separate commands for better control of payload landing locations).
    The parachute system for the Rocket University payload is an inline, pre-deployed
    system that inflates as the payload descends. The balloon then ascends (now more
    quickly, with less payload attached) and bursts at (very approximately) 115,000
    ft, and is not recovered.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntThe subscale Maraia Capsule includes
    avionics, a parachute deployment system, communications, power, a global positioning
    system (GPS) / inertial navigation system (INS) sensor, a GoPro camera, a flight
    processor, and a data recorder. A barometric altimeter is being added for Flight
    #2.&lt;/p&gt;rn&lt;p&gt;rntA number of blog websites and YouTube videos have been
    posted on the web of other groups and individuals performing high-altitude balloon
    flights. However, NASA&amp;rsquo;s effort is unique because it is pushing the envelope
    on small high-altitude balloon flights in a few different ways. First, Rocket University
    has developed an avionics platform that will fly on large-scale balloon flights,
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and rockets. Second, Rocket University&amp;rsquo;s
    approach of using telemetered and recorded GPS, inertial measurement unit (IMU),
    altimeter, and video data is much more advanced than the typical hobbyist&amp;rsquo;s
    approach of using a cell phone / camera combination tracked via the web. Additionally,
    this capsule uses a parachute deploy system originally modified from a typical rocketry
    system using black powder to one using a commanded servo/pin/spring combination,
    in order to reduce the hazard associated with explosives. Finally, this capsule
    is a prototype for a potential sample return capsule designed to bring back samples
    from the ISS, an asteroid, the Moon, or Mars.&lt;/p&gt;rn",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
