	"notes": "To address the NASA need for innovative methods to measure liquid propellant tank volume and tank fluid level with improved accuracy, repeatability, and minimal tank entries for maintenance and calibration, Luminit, LLC, proposes to develop a new non-contact Luminit Optical Tank-level Sensing system (LOTS), based on the optical measurement of a small spotlight shone on the surface of the liquid.  This approach incorporates commercial off-the-shelf components and Luminit opto-mechanical design, which enables us to meet NASA requirements for a novel liquid level sensor for low-density fluids such as liquid hydrogen, and offers the possibility of remote operation, compact size.  In Phase I, Luminit will demonstrate the feasibility of accurate measurement of a low-density fluid by building and testing a proof-of-concept prototype, which will reduce development risk in Phase II.  In Phase II, Luminit plans to build a functional prototype for cryogenic liquid level measurements.  The demonstrated results will offer NASA a replacement for the multiple float switches currently in use. LOTS is expected to be at TRL 2 by the end of Phase I, with the results of this project paving the way to reach TRL 6 by the end of Phase II.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
