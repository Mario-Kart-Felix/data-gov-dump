    Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, from 20110606 to 20110617, reef fish assessment surveys were conducted,
    as a part of Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA), in the Marianas region by the Coral
    Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center
    (PIFSC). 111 REA sites were surveyed at Guam in the Marianas region. At each REA
    site, fish biologists entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~700 m^2) and
    high degree of taxonomic resolution REA survey to assess and monitor species diversity,
    size distribution, and abundance of fish in shallow-water hard-bottom (less than
    30 m) habitats. Reef fish assessment surveys were focused on cataloging the diversity
    (species richness), abundance (numeric density) and biomass (fish mass per unit
    area) of diurnally active reef fish assemblages. The stationary point count (SPC)
    method was used to quantify reef fish species. Two divers lay out a 30 m transect
    line, and position themselves at the 7.5 and 22.5 meter marks. The SPC biologist
    then records estimated size and abundance of all fish within a visually estimated
    15-m diameter cylinder centered on the stationary diver (7.5-m radius, total area
    ~ 177m^2 per cylinder). The diver first spends 5 minutes identifying all fish species
    in the cylindrical area, then proceeds to count and estimate size (total length)
    for each in a series of "instantaneous" point counts or sweeps of the cylinder.
    Fish were identified at the species level, wherever possible. All reef-associated
    fish, including those in the water column, were surveyed. The survey time for each
    stationary point count survey was approximately 20 min and generally two stationary
    point count surveys (one per diver) were conducted at each fish REA site. After
    completing REA surveys, divers noted the presence, at the survey site, of any unusual
    fish species not counted during SPC counts, in order to facilitate species lists
    per location.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key": "bbox-east-long",ntt"value":
