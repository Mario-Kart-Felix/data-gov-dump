  for Leptoseris in the Au'au Channel region. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modeling software
  was used to create this ensemble model, which is an average of 10 model replicates.
  MaxEnt works by analyzing the distribution of environmental variables where species
  are present, so it can find other areas that meet all of the same environmental
  constraints. Georeferenced records containing information about mesophotic coral
  occurrence and environmental predictors describing the seafloor's depth, vertical
  structure, available light, surface temperature, currents and distance from shoreline
  were used to train MaxEnt. Model performance and accuracy were assessed using Receiver
  Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) and a randomly chosen,
  spatially independent data subset. The average test AUC for this predictive ensemble
  model was 0.9, and the overall accuracy of this ensemble predictive model was 73.1%
  (when the habitat suitability threshold = 0.25). The habitat suitability threshold
  of 0.25 represents the sum of the maximum ROC sensitivity and specificity values.
  Extreme care should be taken when selecting a habitat suitability threshold because
  it affects the probability of correctly identifying the presence and absence of
  mesophotic corals. For more information describing how this predictive surface was
  developed and its limitations, please see the following website: https://coastalscience.noaa.gov/projects/detail?key=48\",\n\t\"license_title\":
