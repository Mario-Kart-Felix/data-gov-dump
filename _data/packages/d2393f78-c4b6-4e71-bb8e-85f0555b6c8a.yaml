  SST fields derived from NOAA/AVHRR data and available over 6 pre-defined zones,
  4 times per day.  After acquisition and calibration at CMS, the NOAA/AVHRR data
  are re-mapped onto a stereopolar grid to produce mosaics of consecutive orbits over
  Europe and the Near Atlantic at a 2 km resolution. Mosaics are made over a \"Rectification
  Grand Domaine\" area (RGD). For re-mapped grid points observed by more than one
  overpass, the smallest satellite zenith angle data are selected. In the normal conditions
  when two satellites are operational, four mosaics per day are produced for all the
  AVHRR channels. SSTs are then calculated from these data. Six zones are then extracted
  . They are 1024 * 1024 pixels in size to offer the users (presumably interested
  by local phenomena) the possibility of handling a restricted volume of data. Note
  that SSTs are calculated over the entire RGD, but only the predefined zones are
  delivered as NAR products.The operational CMS AVHRR cloud mask in use is based on
  a multi-spectral thresholding algorithm (Derrien and Le Gleau 1999). Some refinements
  specific to the marine conditions have been introduced including Use of fine scale
  climatology and a fine gradiant climatology to assist in the detection of clouds
  in areas characterised by strong thermal gradients. SSTs are derived from the 11
  and 12 micron brightness temperatures (T11 and T12) . The NOAA /AVHRR has three
  IR channels : channel 3 (3.6-3.8 micron), channel 4 (10.2-11.2 micron) and channel
  5 (11.5-12.5 micron) which provide IR data at 1-km spatial resolution at the satellite
  subpoint (Kidwell, 1997). NOAA-14 and NOAA-16 have similar characteristics, but
  with distinct radiometer filter functions that necessitate distinct algorithm coefficients.
  The algorithms coefficients are derived from multilinear regression on a simulation
  database . At night the use of the 3.7 channel in a triple window algorithm improves
  the SST retrieval performances under high water vapor content conditions.  The expected
  accuracy is defined as the expected bias and standard deviation of the primary calculations
  against drifting buoy measurements determined on a monthly or yearly basis. The
  following performance evaluation was derived from a detailed validation of NOAA/AVHRR
  derived SSTs (Brisson et al 2001). Bias: Apart for the first 2 months after the
  launch of a new satellite, the monthly biases should remain within +/-0.4 K by night.
  By day local biases of several K are possible because of shallow diurnal heating.
  nStandard deviation: see table below: low-cloud cases (cloud coverage less than
  10% of the validation box) have been separated from all cases (cloud coverage less
  than 60%). The \"expected maximum standard deviation\" or the expected maximum biases
  are the maximum values that can be observed under normal conditions. When these
  values are overpassed, some anomaly may have occurred and the problem must be identified.
  Standard deviation Table Yearly, all Monthly, all Yearly, low-cloud Monthly, lowcloud
  0.7 0.8 0.6 0.7 nPhysical definition nsubskin SST : Comparable to in situ (buoy)
  measurements at night. nRelation to bulk SST: equivalent to bulk SST by night. By
  day, a bias of several Kelvin may be found under favorable diurnal heating conditions,
  nRelation to skin SST: By day and by night the subskin SST is convertible to skin
  temperature by subtracting 0.2K. nUnits and range nUnits: Centi-Kelvins nWhen using
  GRIB format, a scaling factor of 100 must be applied. nNo lower limit is imposed
  on the SST calculations, providing the sea is ice free. The expected range is thus
  from about -3 degC till 35 degC, corresponding to actual values of 27000 to 30800.
  nUnprocessed data (for whatever reason) show a negative value (-32768) in HDF format,
  or is flagged as missing in GRIB section3. nOrigin nSST calculated from the IR channel

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
