	"notes": "Orbital Research proposes to develop, build and test 3 additional high temperature components for use in the design of a Data Concentrator Module in distributed turbine engine control at high temperatures.  The concentrator receives analog and digital signals related to turbine engine control and communicates with a FADEC or high level command processor. This data concentrator follows the road map put forth by DECWG for use in creating a demonstration platform for turbine engine distributed controls communication development that operates at temperatures at least up to 225C.rnrnPhase I was the development of detailed specifications for each component needed for the system, as well as to define the total system specification.  This entailed a combination of system design, compiling existing component specifications, laboratory testing, and simulation.  The results showed the feasibility of the data concentrator.rnrnPhase II of this program will focus on three key objectives:rnThe first objective will be to update Data Concentrator design modifications from DECWG and Prime Contractors.  Secondly, to define the requirements for the three new high temperature ASICs.  Finally to validate each design by testing over temperature and under load.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
