	"notes": "Innovative network architecture, protocols, and algorithms are proposednfor both lunar surface networks and orbit access networks. Firstly, annoverlaying architecture is proposed to seamlessly integrate lunarnsurface networks and orbit access networks. Secondly, for lunar surfacennetworks, a network architecture based on hybrid mesh networkingntechnologies is developed to support both fixed and mobile nodes on thenlunar surface. It supports autonomous network coverage extension via adnhoc networking capability. Link adaptation algorithms provide automaticnlink configuration and ensure constant high link quality in a dynamicnharsh environment. To support QoS of heterogeneous traffic types, a QoSnoriented MAC protocol with scalable throughput performance is proposed.nA hybrid routing protocol is also proposed to enhance routing efficiencynand dramatically improve the reliability of ad hoc networking. Thirdly,nfor orbit access networks, a dynamic delay and disruption-tolerantnnetworking (DTN) routing protocol is designed by integrating DTN andnmobile ad hoc network (MANET) reactive routing. It is disruptionntolerant and capable of supporting intermittent links. Finally, beaconnbased communications serve as the remedy to handle the emergentnsituation where neither lunar surface network nor orbit access is available.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
