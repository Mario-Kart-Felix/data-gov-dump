The EO-1 mission validated highly integrated multispectral data from the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) sensor and hyperspectral imaging data from the Hyperion sensor. After the initial technology mission was accomplished, NASA and the USGS agreed to continue the EO-1 program due to high interest in the specialized data from scientific communities. EO-1 Data products consist of imagery collected during the original one-year mission, as well as more recent Data Acquisition Requests (DARs) from the EO-1 Extended Mission. EO-1 scenes are processed to Level 1Gst (L1Gst) and images with adequate ground control points are processed to Level 1T (L1T). L1Gst and L1T products are provided in GeoTIFF format. Scenes that have been processed to L1T are also available as Full Resolution Browse and GIS Ready Bundle products in JPEG format. Level 1R (L1R) products in HDF format are only available for Hyperion data.",
