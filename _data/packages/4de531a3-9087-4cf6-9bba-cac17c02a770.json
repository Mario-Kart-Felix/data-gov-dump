NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) underwater video data offshore of Buck Island, St. Croix, US Virgin Islands and off of LaParguera, Puerto Rico from 3/21/06 to 4/2/06. Data was acquired with a Phantom S2 ROV operated by NOAA's National Undersea Research Program (NURP) and georeferenced and visually interpreted by CCMA employees. Data is in UTM zone 20N, datum WGS84.",
