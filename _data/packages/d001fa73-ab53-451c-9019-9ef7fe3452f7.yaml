  by the MCC to measure the impact of the Compact activities on economic and social
  outcomes. This Impact Evaluation (IE) design report lays out how the SI team aims
  to establish a causal relationship between program interventions and observed changes
  in household availability and consumption of different sources of water, household
  income, household expenditure and household health indicators. It also details our
  strategy for measuring potential impacts on other sectors (agriculture, utility
  financial performance, and local enterprises) should these occur in parallel to,
  or instead of, the expected impacts on households. This IE is, to our knowledge,
  the first attempt to conduct a rigorous IE design of a large infrastructure project
  in Jordan. It provides a unique opportunity for the MCC, the GOJ, and the broader
  development community to understand the impact of a large water investment on income
  and poverty of urban households and others who are affected by it.nnThe IE will
  make every possible attempt to measure the impact of the three inter-linked projects
  separately, in order for MCC to better understand which component(s) of their investment
  led to specific changes in outcomes. A comparison of the different impacts will
  further allow for conclusions about the relative cost-effectiveness of each intervention.
  It must however be noted that because of the complementarities between these different
  projects, there are very important limitations in the extent to which the IE design
  will be able to disentangle the separate impacts of the Water Network Project (WNP),
  the Wastewater Network Project  (WWNP), the As-Samra Expansion Project (AEP). Since
  all three projects are being implemented in Zarqa at the same time, often in overlapping
  locations, there will be complicated interactions among them which may make it difficult
  to identify the incremental impacts of each individual intervention. In addition,
  a significant element contributing to the economic logic of the Compact investments
  - which we discuss more thoroughly throughout this report - is an assumed water
  efficiency improvement that would stem from substitution of conventional freshwater
  currently used in irrigated areas in the Jordan Valley with an expanded supply of
  treated wastewater collected in Zarqa. The full extent of this assumed substitution
  effect in fact relies on both the water and wastewater network investments and not
  on the AEP. It is further assumed that the conventional freshwater saved by this
  substitution would be made available for higher value uses by municipal and industrial
  users, thereby improving economic outcomes. nnFor the purposes of presentation,
  we have grouped similar and complementary data collection activities into three
  components, which are described in detail in Section E of this report. This presentation
  is not intended to imply that any of these three specific components are non-essential;
  indeed we make the case that all are necessary if the goal is to adequately measure
  and reduce the risks of misattribution in the overall Compact impact. This point
  is made following our presentation of the IE logic and a subsequent discussion of
  the overarching evaluation framework unifying the three components, prior to presenting
  the details of those components.  nnOverview of the impact evaluation logicnnAs
  emphasized in pre-project feasibility studies and economic analyses of the Compact
  investments, the economic case for the MCC investments rests on a complex and interrelated
  set of hypothesized changes. The linkages between the various components and intermediate
  and final outcomes, respectively, are depicted in the IE logic shown in Figure ES.1.
  It is important to note that Figure ES.1 does not directly follow the categorization
  of impacts promulgated in previous descriptions of Compact impacts (e.g. accompanying
  the MCC's economic rate of return analysis), for the following main reasons:nn1)
  The impacts included in those analyses were admittedly non-exhaustive, due to data
  limitations in quantifying them. (For example, effects on enterprises and/or on
  property values were omitted from the analyses - see Section D of this report.)n2)
  The purposes of the IE logic are a) to trace the relationships between projects,
  intermediate outputs, and final outcomes, b) to illustrate the overlapping relationships
  between project activities and desired outcomes, and c) to draw attention to the
  underlying assumptions.nnThe IE logic aims to identify the set of final outcomes
  (and to a lesser extent the intermediate outputs) we intend to measure and track
  through our IE design. Importantly, the so-called primary substitution effect (the
  increased use of blended KTR water in irrigation in the place of freshwater) is
  not and cannot be measured or shown as a single outcome. Rather, the quantification
  of this possible benefit stems from analysis that integrates several outcomes and
  outputs - to be carried out at the conclusion of the IE using data we proposed to
  collect - that flow through the following connections: a) reduced physical losses
  (WNP) and b) increased wastewater capture (WNP and WWNP); which lead to c) increased
  wastewater use in agriculture and d) substitution of King Talal Reservoir (KTR)
  water for King Abdullah Canal (KAC) water in the Jordan Valley; which together e)
  change per-capita use of utility water and lead to f) end-user time savings; g)
  consumer cost savings; h) aesthetic and health benefits; and i) are capitalized
  in land values. Similarly, understanding the net value of the secondary substitution
  effect, or the increased use of network water in place of tanker and/or vended water,
  flows through a complex chain that includes (not in order of importance), a) improved
  water quality at the point of delivery and b) changes in per capita use of utility
  water (due to the factors listed above as well as these quality improvements) which
  are embedded in reduced purchase of c) tanker water and d) vended water; both of
  which should ultimately appear as consumer e) cost and f) time savings, but may
  also result in reduced sales and/or profits in the water tanker and vended water
  industries. In addition, the extent of these primary and secondary substitution
  effects will likely be mediated (positively or negatively) by changes in utility
  performance, itself a function of the delivery of improved services.n      \",\n\t\"license_title\":
