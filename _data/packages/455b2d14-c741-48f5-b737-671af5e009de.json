It is an on-going challenge to maximize electrical power available to spacecraft while reducing overall stowage volume and mass of solar array, which requires developing more efficient solar cells with higher specific power density. rnrnThe objective of this SBIR project is to develop a generic approach, based on novel functional nano-materials, to significantly increasing the solar cell efficiency (~10&#37;), specific power density, radiation resistance and lifetime, without adding much cost or weight to the existing solar cells. The feasibility to synthesis such nano-materials has been explored and demonstrated in Phase I. Without optimizing, preliminary test on commercial solar cells show an efficiency gain approaching 5&#37; after applying such nano-materials. Such nano-materials will be further improved for energy efficiency and environmental durability in Phase II, to reach the objective of at least 10&#37; gain in energy efficiency on majority of commercial solar cells. rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
