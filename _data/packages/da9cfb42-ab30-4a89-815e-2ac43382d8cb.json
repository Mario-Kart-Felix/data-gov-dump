	"notes": "This data set reports the results of chemical analyses of rainfall, throughfall, litter leachate, and soil water samples collected before, during, and after a rainfall exclusion experiment conducted at the km 67 Seca Floresta site, Tapajos National Forest, Brazil. Samples were collected every two weeks from May 17, 1999 through May 10, 2006. Measurements included alkalinity, conductivity, pH, and selected anions and cations analyzed by ion chromatography.The exclusion treatment, began in late January 2000 and continued through December 2004, involved diverting about 60% of throughfall (equivalent to approximately half the rainfall) from a 1-hectare plot using plastic panels installed in the understory. The comparable 1-hectare control plot was unaltered. The purpose was to observe the potential effects of severe water stress on a humid Amazonian forest (Nepstad et al., 2002 and Nepstad et al., 2007). There are five comma-delimited data files with this data set. ",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
