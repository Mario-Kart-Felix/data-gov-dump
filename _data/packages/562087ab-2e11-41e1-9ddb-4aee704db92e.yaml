    association units. It was develped by the National Cooperative Soil Survey and supersedes
    the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) data set published in 1994. It consists of a
    broad based inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern
    on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. The
    data set was created by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more
    detailed soil survey maps were not available, data on geology, topography, vegetation,
    and climate were assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT)
    images. Soils of like areas were studied, and the probable classification and extent
    of the soils were determined. Map unit composition was determined by transecting
    or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically
    to characterize the whole map unit. This data set consists of georeferenced vector
    digital data and tabular digital data. The map data were collected in 1-by 2-degree
    topographic quadrangle units and merged into a seamless national data set. It is
    distributed in state/territory and national extents. The soil map units are linked
    to attributes in the National Soil Information System data base which gives the
    proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.",nt"license_title":

    The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service should
    be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data. Hardcopies
    utilizing these data shall clearly indicate their source. User agrees not to misrepresent
    these data, nor to imply that changes made were approved by the Natural Resources
    Conservation Service. The Digital General Soil Map of U.S. was designed primarily
    for regional, multicounty, river basin, State, and multistate resource planning,
    management, and monitoring. Data are not detailed enough to make interpretations
    at a county level. This soil survey product is not designed for use as a primary
    regulatory tool in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference
    source. The use of these data is not restricted and may be interpreted by organizations,
    agencies, units of government, or others; however, they are responsible for its
    appropriate application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign
    to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions that
    they make. The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations
    of these maps for purposes related solely to state or local regulatory programs.
    When data from the Digital General Soil Map of U.S. are overlayed with other data
    layers, such as land use data, caution must be used in generating statistics on
    the co-occurence of the land use data with the soil data. The composition of the
    soil map unit can be characterized independently for the land use and for the soil
    component, but there are no data on their joint occurrence at a more detailed level.
    Analysis of the overlayed data should be on a map polygon basis. Additional political,
    watershed, or other boundaries may be intersected with the soil data. Although the
    composition of each political and watershed unit may be described in terms of the
    soil map units, information is not available to assign the components to the boundary
    units with full accuracy. As with the land use categories, the analysis should be
    restricted to the classified components. The approximate minimum area delineated
    is 625 hectares (1,544 acres), which is represented on a 1:250,000-scale map by
    an area approximately 1 cm by 1 cm (0.4 inch by 0.4 inch). Linear delineations are
    not less than 0.5 cm (0.2 inch) in width. The number of delineations per 1:250,000
    quadrangle typically is 100 to 200, but may range up to 400. Delineations depict
    the dominant soils making up the landscape. Other dissimilar soils, too small to
    be delineated, are present within a delineation. Digital enlargements of these data
    to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation
    of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils
    that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations,
    and analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing,
    and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their
    interpretations are intended for planning purposes only. Data values for some data
    elements may be incomplete or missing. Where data are unavailable, a mask should
    be used to exclude the area from analysis. The spatial and tabular data used to
    create this product are periodically updated. Data are versioned, and users are
    responsible for obtaining the latest version of the product.", "Access Constraints:
