    prognostic health management solutions for electro-mechanical actuators and, thus,
    increase their reliability and attractiveness to designers of the next generation
    aircraft and spacecraft. In pursuit of this goal the team adopted a systematic approach
    by starting with EMA FMECA reviews, consultations with EMA manufacturers, and extensive
    literature reviews of previous efforts. Based on the acquired knowledge, nominal/off-nominal
    physics models and prognostic health management algorithms were developed. In order
    to aid with development of the algorithms and validate them on realistic data, a
    testbed capable of supporting experiments in both laboratory and flight environment
    was developed. Test actuators with architectures similar to potential flight-certified
    units were obtained for the purposes of testing and realistic fault injection methods
    were designed. Several hundred fault scenarios were created, using permutations
    of position and load profiles, as well as fault severity levels. The diagnostic
    system was tested extensively on these scenarios, with the test results demonstrating
    high accuracy and low numbers of false positive and false negative diagnoses. The
    prognostic system was utilized to track fault progression in some of the fault scenarios,
    predicting the remaining useful life of the actuator. A series of run-to-failure
    experiments were conducted to validate its performance, with the resulting error
    in predicting time to failure generally lesser than 10% error. While a more robust
    validation procedure would require dozens more experiments executed under the same
    conditions (and, consequently, more test articles destroyed), the current results
    already demonstrate the potential for predicting fault progression in this type
    of devices. More prognostic experiments are planned for the next phase of this work,
    including investigation and comparison of other prognostic algorithms (such as various
    types of Particle Filter and GPR), addition of new fault types, and execution of
    prognostic experiments in flight environment.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
