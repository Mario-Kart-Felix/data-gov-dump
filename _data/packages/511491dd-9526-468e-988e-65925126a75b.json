	"notes": "The objective of the Phase II SBIR project is to develop a prototype sensor system to detect gaseous analytes in support of the spacecraft environmental monitoring and control system. InnoSense LLC (ISL) has utilized its Chemical Fingerprint?' sensor array fabrication technology in Phase I to establish the feasibility of a miniature device with multi-analyte detection capability.  In particular, we have detected oxygen, carbon dioxide and humidity as potential target analytes. The oxygen sensor performed over 3-45&#37; concentrations under a variable pressure of 8-14.7 psia. The Phase I working model could generated discernible signal with 0.1&#37; O2 concentration. Upon fine-tuning the indicators in Phase II, the system performance will be tested with a prototype hardware that will also be developed in Phase II.  ISL has received technology endorsement letter from a prime contractor in the NASA application area.  ISL has also secured Phase III follow-on funding commitment from a commercialization partner. For assuring success of this project, ISL has assembled a technical team with a cumulative 100 person-years of experience in developing commercially viable sensor systems.  ",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
