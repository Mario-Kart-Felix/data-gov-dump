The data set provided by IDEM was in an ESRI geodatabase format and the feature class was named LUST. LUST_IDEM_IN is attributed with facility identifications, federal identification numbers, and addresses. Facility information and locational coordinates for state programs were provided by the Leaking Underground Tank Group within the Office of Land Quality, Indiana Department of Environmental Management. The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile named LUST_SITES: \"This dataset consists of known sites with leaking underground storage tanks. Regulated underground storage tanks (USTs) contain regulated substances including petroleum and hazardous substances such as those typically found at gasoline stations, fleet fueling facilities, and industrial sites. If a release from a UST system is suspected or confirmed, the owner and operator must report it to IDEM, stop any on-going release, investigate to determine the type and extent of contamination, and conduct cleanup actions as necessary. These sites are called Leaking USTs. The actions must be taken as described in the UST rules - 329 IAC 9-4 and 5 (http:\/\/www.in.gov\/legislative\/ic\/code\/title13\/ar23\/).\"",
