    for the geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore of Pacifica map area, California.
    The vector data file is included in "Folds_OffshorePacifica.zip," which is accessible
    from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshorePacifica/data_catalog_OffshorePacifica.html.
    The Offshore of Pacifica map area straddles the right-lateral transform boundary
    between the North American and Pacific plates and is cut by several active faults
    that cumulatively form a distributed shear zone, including the San Andreas Fault,
    the eastern strand of the San Gregorio Fault, the Golden Gate Fault, and the Potato
    Patch Fault (sheets 8, 9; Bruns and others, 2002; Ryan and others, 2008). These
    faults are covered by Holocene sediments (mostly units Qms, Qmsb, Qmst) with no
    seafloor expression, and are mapped using seismic-reflection data (sheet 8). The
    San Andreas Fault is the primary plate-boundary structure and extends northwest
    across the map area; it intersects the shoreline 10 km north of the map area at
    Pacifica Lagoon, and 3 km south of the map area at Mussel Rock. This section of
    the San Andreas Fault has an estimated slip rate of 17 to 24 mm/yr (U.S. Geological
    Survey, 2010), and the devastating Great 1906 California earthquake (M 7.8) is thought
    to have nucleated on the San Andreas a few kilometers offshore of San Francisco
    within the map area (sheet 9; Bolt, 1968; Lomax, 2005). The San Andreas Fault forms
    the boundary between two distinct basement terranes, Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous
    rocks of the Franciscan Complex to the east, and Late Cretaceous granitic and older
    metamorphic rocks of the Salinian block to the west. Franciscan Complex rocks (unit
    KJf, undivided) form seafloor outcrops at and north of Point Lobos adjacent to onland
    exposures. The Franciscan is divided into 13 different units for the onshore portion
    of this geologic map based on different lithologies and ages, but the unit cannot
    be similarly divided in the offshore because of a lack of direct observation and
    (or) sampling. Folds were primarily mapped by interpretation of seismic reflection
    profile data (see S-15-10-NC and F-2-07-NC). The seismic reflection profiles were
    collected between 2007 and 2010. References Cited Bolt, B.A., 1968, The focus of
