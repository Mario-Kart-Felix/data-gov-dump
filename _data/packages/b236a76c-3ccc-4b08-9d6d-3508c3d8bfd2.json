	"notes": "The overall goal of this project is to develop an onboard, autonomous Multi-spacecraft Supervisory Engine (MSE) for formation-flying guidance, navigation and control (FF-GNC), suitable for a wide range of formation flying topologies and distributed, multi-spacecraft missions. MSE will be developed in the context of specific NASA formation flying missions, using Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) as the target FF-GNC system architecture. Other missions, such as the Stellar Imager and/or MAXIM will also be studied.rnIt will be developed using the concepts of Intelligent Systems, Formal Methods for Finite-State Automata modeling and Hybrid Model Predictive Optimization. rnSpecific problems to be addressed include: formation initialization and calibration maneuver planning/control, formation reconfiguration (including conflict/constraint resolution), FF-GNC resource allocation and optimal resource management, and FF-GNC health maintenance and reconfiguration.rnIn collaboration with the relevant technology teams at NASA-JPL, we propose co-development of MSE technology in parallel with (and interfaced to) NASA-JPL's FF mission and GNC analysis testbeds (ie. Formation Algorithms and Simulation Testbed, FAST and Formation Control Testbed, FCT).rnThe Phase II project will deliver MSE system designs, prototype software, analysis tools and techniques.rnA Technology Infusion Roadmap for MSE technology will also be provided for NASA Program Office planning purposes.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
