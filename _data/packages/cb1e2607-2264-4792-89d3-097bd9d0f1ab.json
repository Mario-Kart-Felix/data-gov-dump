	"notes": "California myotis (Myotis californicus) and California leaf-nosed bats (Macrotus californicus) were collected from five mines used as roost sites to assess concentrations and potential adverse effects of trace elements. Geometric mean carcass lead concentrations in bats collected from two lead mines (62 and 102 ug/g dry weight) were significantly (P<0.0001) higher than those in individuals from nearby gold and silver mines (0.96-2.59 ug/g dry weight). Carcass concentrations were within the range reported in bats collected from known lead-contaminated sites. A geometric mean of 16.6 ug/g dry weight lead in leaf-nosed bat liver samples was among the highest recorded in apparently healthy individuals of any species. Arsenic, cadmium, mercury, and selenium in bat carcass and liver tissues were below biologically significant thresholds. Bats roosting in lead mines may be accumulating a significant portion of their total body burden at the roost site by ingesting lead particles while grooming or through inhalation of lead contaminated dust. Soil from two lead mine roost sites contained from 56,900 to 102,000 ug/g lead. These concentrations were up to three orders of magnitude higher than those in soil from reference mines (37-250 ug/g). Water used to wash bats before dissection contained 18 trace elements; whereas, only three were detected in reference water samples. Lead concentrations in the different media tested (soil, wash water, carcass, and liver tissues) were consistently higher in samples from lead mines than in samples from gold and silver mines. The detection of trace elements in wash/rinse water indicates that these elements were present as particles on the bats fur and were available to be ingested during grooming.",
