  unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
  thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
  years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
  we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
  to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
  in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
  to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
  air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
  Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
  spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
  explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
  and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
  rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
  expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
  NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
  to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
  around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
  continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
  Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
  Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
  such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"title\": \"National

  for use in the aerospace industry. Compared to metallic structures their behavior
  is less well understood. This lack of understanding may pose constraints on their
  use. One possible way to deal with some of the risks associated with potential failure
  is to perform in-situ monitoring to detect precursors of failures. Prognostic algorithms
  can be used to predict impending failures. They require large amounts of training
  data to build and tune damage model for making useful predictions. One of the key
  aspects is to get confirmatory feedback from data as damage progresses. These kinds
  of data are rarely available from actual systems. The next possible resource to
  collect such data is an accelerated aging platform. To that end this paper describes
  a fatigue cycling experiment with the goal to stress carbon-carbon composite coupons
  with various layups. Piezoelectric disc sensors were used to periodically interrogate
  the system. Analysis showed distinct differences in the signatures of growing failures
  between data collected at conditions. Periodic X-radiographs were taken to assess
  the damage ground truth. Results after signal processing showed clear trends of
  damage growth that were correlated to damage assessed from the X-ray images.\",\n\t\"owner_org\":
