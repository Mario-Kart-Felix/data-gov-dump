	"notes": "Large, single-piece composite structures for NASA launch vehicles are currently very expensive or impossible to fabricate partly because of the capital (ovens, autoclaves, and tooling) needed to cure the part and maintain tolerances at cure conditions.  CRG proposes the use of recently developed, no-oven, no-autoclave composite processing technology to fabricate very large, high-performance, single-piece composite structures and tooling for NASA launch vehicles and other aerospace structures. This will reduce capital (plant, equipment, and tooling), operating, and labor-based manufacturing costs.  This technology enables rapid manufacturing of large, single-piece structures with no dependence on size-limiting infrastructure and offers the potential for on-site manufacturing.  CRG believes this technology to be equally beneficial for quick throughput in smaller sized, high-volume production; but the proposed focus will be large, low-volume production.  This technology proposes to surpass current efforts on out-of-autoclave composite processing technology in terms of both acquisition and operations cost to the end user. This will be accomplished through lower production costs and lightweight, unitized structures that require less maintenance. This three-phase program proposes to advance this technology from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 4 and a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) of 3 to a TRL of 9 and a MRL of 9. ",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
