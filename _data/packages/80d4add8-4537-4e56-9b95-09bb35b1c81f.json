		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

A semi-supervised learning algorithm for the classification of hyperspectral data,rnGaussian process expectation maximization (GP-EM), is proposed. Model parameters for eachrnland cover class is first estimated by a supervised algorithm using Gaussian process regressionsrnto find spatially adaptive parameters, and the estimated parameters are then used to initialize arnspatially adaptive mixture-of-Gaussians model. The mixture model is updated by expectationmaximizationrniterations using the unlabeled data, and the spatially adaptive parameters for unlabeledrninstances are obtained by Gaussian process regressions with soft assignments. Two setsrnof hyperspectral data taken from the Botswana area by the NASA EO-1 satellite are used for experiments.rnEmpirical evaluations show that the proposed framework performs significantly betterrnthan baseline algorithms that do not use spatial information, and the results are also better thanrnany previously reported results by other algorithms on the same data.",
