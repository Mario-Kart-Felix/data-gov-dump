  sits at the north end of a large lake called Bear Lake, and is located in southeast
  Idaho, seven miles southwest of the town of Montpelier. It is in the Bear Lake Valley
  at an elevation of approximately 5,925 feet. This region of Idaho contains 15 phosphate
  mines owned by 6 different companies, as well as numerous u201corphanedu201d mine
  sites primarily of underground design. One of the inactive, underground phosphate
  mines, Hot Springs Mine, is located on the southeast corner of the Refuge, across
  from Mud Lake (Figure 1). Two other sites, the Bloomington Canyon Mine, and Paris
  Canyon Mine are located upstream of two creeks that flow into the Refuge. Concerns
  developed over the potential movement of contaminants from these sites into the
  Refuge when investigations at other phosphate mines in the region indicated that
  elevated concentrations of contaminants, and in particular selenium, were being
  released into the environment. In addition, the Refuge is heavily influenced by
  agricultural return flows and acts as a sediment trap for the Bear River, which
  is often diverted through the Refuge and into Bear Lake, a natural waterbody now
  often used for irrigation storage and power generation. This study was undertaken
  to assess the potential risk to fish and wildlife from contaminants associated with
  mining and agricultural activities within the Bear Lake Refuge drainage. Several
  matrices were evaluated for contamination, including: water, sediment, plants, invertebrates,
  fish, and bird eggs. Sampling sites included surface water inflows to and outflows
  from the refuge, and several locations within Mud Lake (Figure 1). Chemical analyses
  included scans for inorganics and organochlorine compounds (OCs) to determine whether
  contaminants associated with both agricultural with its legacy pollutants, and mining
  activities are accumulating in sediment and biota on the Refuge. The Bear River
  and its tributaries entering the Bear Lake National Wildlife Refuge have a designated
  beneficial use of coldwater aquatic life and salmonid spawning. Most water quality
  parameters (i.e. temperature, dissolved oxygen, etc.) were within the range of criterion
  to support aquatic life. Organochlorine concentrations in sediment, plants, fish,
  and bird eggs did not appear to be at levels harmful to aquatic resources. No OCs
  were detected in sediment or plant samples, two OCs were detected at low concentrations
  in fish tissues (p,pu2019-DDD and p,pu2019-DDE), and four OCs were detected at low
  concentrations in eggs (heptachlor epoxide, p,pu2019-DDE, total PCBs, and trans-nonachlor).
  Inorganic concentrations were analyzed in sediment, water, invertebrates, fish,
  and bird eggs. As with organochlorine compounds, bird egg tissue had low levels
  of inorganics. However, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, manganese, and strontium,
  were elevated in sediments and exceeded guidelines and/or effects thresholds. Concentrations
  of lead in invertebrates from Paris Creek were within the range known to cause dietary
  effects to fish, and zinc levels in fish tissue were well above what is considered
  to be background and exceeded concentrations reported to cause effects in birds.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
