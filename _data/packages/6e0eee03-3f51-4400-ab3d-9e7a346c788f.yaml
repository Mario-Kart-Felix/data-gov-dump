    unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that,
    thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50
    years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do
    we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying
    to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work
    in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works
    to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system:
    air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and
    Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial
    spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience:
    explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery;
    and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology:
    rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies,
    expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century,
    NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars
    to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit
    around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope
    continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James
    Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space
    Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners
    such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"title": "National

    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Canopy measurements in an undisturbed eastern
    Amazon forest (Cauxi, Para, Brazil. See Figure 1) were derived from a one-time event
    in 2000 using a hand-held laser range finder, and diameter at breast height (DBH)
    was determined manually. Parameters reported include: Crown Width, Crown Depth,
    Tree Height, and DBH. There is one comma-delimited ASCII data file with this data
    set. In addition, these manually derived measurements were compared to the IKONOS
    satellite data of crown dimensions that were acquired on 2 November 2000, from an
    orbital altitude of 680 km. The data from a 600 x 600 m block of undisturbed forest,
    including the 50 ha area surveyed in the field, were analyzed in a combined image
    processing and geographic information system environment.DATA QUALITY STATEMENT:
    The Data Center has determined that there are questions about the quality of the
    data reported in this data set. The data set has missing or incomplete data, metadata,
    or other documentation that diminishes the usability of the products. KNOWN PROBLEMS:
    Only the general location for this study was identified -- Cauaxi, Para, Brazil.
    The tree measurement data are of limited use because coordinates for the study site,
    coordinates of the beginning and end of the transects, and coordinates of the measured
    trees were not provided. Also, the area that the IKONOS image captured was not provided
    and the IKONOS image is not available due to restricted distribution.",nt"owner_org":
