    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has the most
    complex, enormous, difficult, diverse, distributed, and unique set of integrated
    scheduling problems in the world and it is only getting more difficult as ground
    resources need to be shared by different organizations. KSC's scheduling problem
    is decomposed into many individual but coordinated scheduling problems, each with
    its own unique set of resources, tasks, constraints, ground rules, and scheduling
    techniques, resulting in different scheduling processes for each of the individual
    applications. Stottler Henke's existing Aurora intelligent planning and scheduling
    system development framework was specifically designed for KSC ground operations
    scheduling and to be highly adaptable to different domains and has already proven
    to be adaptable by its successful applications in many dozens of widely varying
    domains (including multiple KSC scheduling domains). In every domain where a comparison
    was performed, Aurora always generated more optimal schedules.  rnThe proposed vision
    is to develop one scheduling tool that SMEs in wildly different KSC areas can adapt
    to create automated scheduling software for different scheduling applications. New
    capabilities need to be added to address the new KSC realities and to make the adaptation
    process more SME-friendly. Initially the Intelligent Operations Scheduling System
    (IOSS) would be fielded in a small number of vehicle and payload processing applications.
     Later SMEs could adapt IOSS themselves. Eventually, IOSS-based automatic scheduling
    systems might constitute the majority of schedule decision making at KSC. These
    separate IOSS scheduling applications could automatically interact, providing automated
    coordination capabilities. These applications will also be able to interoperate
    with legacy scheduling systems. Ultimately, by automating, replacing, or interfacing
    to every scheduling function or system, extreme synergies of coordination and manpower
    savings would result.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
