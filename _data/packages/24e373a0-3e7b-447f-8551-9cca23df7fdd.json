	"notes": "Impact Technologies has proposed development of an effective prognostic and fault accommodation system for critical DC power systems including PV systems. Overall goal for this program is development of techniques that enable power system fault tolerance based on diagnostic features from the solar cells, power bus, and power transistors. After completion of Phase I efforts towards this goal, Impact has achieved substantial and promising results in several technical areas that provide opportunities for maturing PHM tools. The technical areas covered include: 1) solar cell modeling and characterization, 2) power system monitoring, 3) semiconductor device modeling and aging characterization, and 4) application of the leakage current sensing to DC systems. During Phase II, impact will apply and maturing phase I accomplishments to incorporate and embed effective PHM techniques and fault tolerance for power system reliability and extended operation. Impact also plans development of a prototype low cost dynamic leakage current sensor for solar cell and DC power system application. The long-term implications of a successful completion of this program will provide reliability and health management tools for the state-of-the-art technologies, such as advanced power systems based on solar power generation, contributing directly to NASA's ISHM efforts.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
