	"notes": "The TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR), the first of its kind in space, isn                        an electronically scanning radar, operating at 13.8 GHz that measuresn                        the 3-D rainfall distribution over both land and ocean, and definesn                        the layer depth of the precipitation.n                        n                        The objectives of 2A25 is to correct for the rain attenuation inn                        measured radar reflectivity and to estimate the instantaneousn                        three-dimensional distribution of rain from the TRMM Precipitationn                        Radar (PR) data.  The estimates of attenuation-corrected radarn                        reflectivity factor and rainfall rate are given at each resolutionn                        cell of the PR.  The estimated near-surface rainfall rate and averagen                        rainfall rate between the two pre-defined altitudes (2 and 4 km) aren                        also calculated for each beam position.n                        n                        2A25 basically uses a hybrid of the Hitschfeld-Bordan method and then                        surface reference method to estimate the vertical true radarn                        reflectivity (Z) profile.  (The hybrid method is described in Iguchin                        and Meneghini (1994)).  The vertical rain profile is then calculatedn                        from the estimated true Z profile by using an appropriate Z-Rn                        relationship.n                        n                        The attenuation correction is, in principle, based on the surfacen                        reference method. This method assumes that the decrease in then                        apparent surface cross section (delta sigma-zero) is caused by then                        propagation loss in rain. The coefficient a in the k-Z relationship,n                        k=a Z**b, is adjusted in such a way that the path-integratedn                        attenuation (PIA) estimated from the measured Zm-profile will matchn                        the delta sigma-zero.  The attenuation correction of Z is carried outn                        by the Hitschfeld-Bordan method with the modified a.  Since a isn                        adjusted, this type of surface reference method is called then                        a-adjustment method.  The a-adjustment method assumes that then                        discrepancy between the PIA estimate from delta sigma-zero and thatn                        from the measured Zm-profile can be attributed to the inappropriaten                        choice of a values, which may vary depending on the raindrop sizen                        distribution and other conditions.  It assumes that the radar isn                        properly calibrated and that the measured Zm has no error.n                        n                        In order to avoid inaccuracies in the attenuation correction when rainn                        is weak, a hybrid of the surface reference method and then                        Hitschfeld-Bordan method is used (Iguchi and Meneghini, 1994).  Then                        PIA is first estimated from the precipitation echo alone.  The weightn                        given by the hybrid method to the PIA estimate from the surfacen                        reference increases as the attenuation estimate increases.  When rainn                        is very weak and the attenuation estimate is small, the PIA estimaten                        from the surface reference is effectively neglected.  With then                        introduction of the hybrid method, the divergence associated with then                        Hitschfeld-Bordan method is also prevented.n                        n                        One major difference from the method described in the above referencen                        is that, in order to deal ...",

What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
