	"notes": "  This data set has been collected from a custom built battery prognostics testbed at the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE). Li-ion batteries were run through 3 different operational profiles (charge, discharge and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) at different temperatures. Discharges were carried out at different current load levels until the battery voltage fell to preset voltage thresholds. Some of these thresholds were lower than that recommended by the OEM (2.7 V) in order to induce deep discharge aging effects. Repeated charge and discharge cycles result in accelerated aging of the batteries. The experiments were stopped when the batteries reached the end-of-life (EOL) criteria of 30% fade in rated capacity (from 2 Ah to 1.4 Ah).rnrn rnrn**Data Acquisition:**rnrn     The testbed comprises:rnrn    * Commercially available Li-ion 18650 sized rechargeable batteries,rn    * Programmable 4-channel DC electronic load,rn    * Programmable 4-channel DC power supply,rn    * Voltmeter, ammeter and thermocouple sensor suite,rn    * Custom EIS equipment,rn    * Environmental chamber to impose various operational conditions,rn    * PXI chassis based DAQ and experiment control, andrnrn rnrnMATLAB based experiment control, data acquisition and prognostics algorithm evaluation setup (appx. data acquisition rate is 10Hz).rnrn rnrn**Parameter Description:**rnrn     Data Structure:rnrn     cycle: top level structure array containing the charge, discharge and impedance operationsrnrn     type: operation  type, can be charge, discharge or impedancernrn     ambient_temperature: ambient temperature (degree C)rnrn     time: the date and time of the start of the cycle, in MATLAB  date vector formatrnrn     data: data structure containing the measurementsrnrn        for charge the fields are:rnrn            Voltage_measured: Battery terminal voltage (Volts)rnrn            Current_measured: Battery output current (Amps)rnrn            Temperature_measured: Battery temperature (degree C)rnrn            Current_charge: Current measured at charger (Amps)rnrn            Voltage_charge: Voltage measured at charger (Volts)rnrn            Time: Time vector for the cycle (secs)rnrn        for discharge the fields are:rnrn            Voltage_measured: Battery terminal voltage (Volts)rnrn            Current_measured: Battery output current (Amps)rnrn            Temperature_measured: Battery temperature (degree C)rnrn rnrn            Current_charge: Current measured at load (Amps)rnrn            Voltage_charge: Voltage measured at load (Volts)rnrn            Time: Time vector for the cycle (secs)rnrn            Capacity: Battery capacity (Ahr) for discharge till 2.7Vrnrn        for impedance the fields are:rnrn            Sense_current: Current in sense branch (Amps)rnrn            Battery_current: Current in battery branch (Amps)rnrn            Current_ratio: Ratio of the above currentsrnrn            Battery_impedance: Battery impedance (Ohms) computed from raw datarnrn            Rectified_impedance: Calibrated and smoothed battery impedance (Ohms)rnrn            Re: Estimated electrolyte resistance (Ohms)rnrn rnrn            Rct: Estimated charge transfer resistance (Ohms) rnrn**Intended Use:**rnrnThe data sets can serve for a variety of purposes. Because these are essentially a large number of Run-to-Failure time series, the data can be set for development of prognostic algorithms. In particular, due to the differences in depth-of-discharge (DOD), the duration of rest periods and intrinsic variability, no two cells have the same state-of-life (SOL) at the same cycle index. The aim is to be able to manage this uncertainty, which is representative of actual usage, and make reliable predictions of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in both the End-of-Discharge (EOD) and End-of-Life (EOL) contexts. rnrn ",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
