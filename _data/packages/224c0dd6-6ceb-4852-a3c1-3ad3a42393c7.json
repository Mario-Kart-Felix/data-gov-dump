	"notes": "Increasing the optical surface finishing precision and reducing surface roughness will greatly benefit astronomy telescope and other optical systems. Conventional optical finishing only delivers about 1/10 lambda surface flatness and is hard to handle arbitrary surface shape. To finish optical surface with low cost to an ultra high precision and to reach the capability of generating arbitrary surface shape such as the aspherical surfaces or special patterns, in this proposal, we propose the development of an innovative computer-controlled optical surface finishing system. We suggest using chemical reactive removal as the tool to remove the material on the optical surface, controlled by computer with a deterministic removal algorithm. In phase I, a prototype system with ultra high precision finishing capability, ~ 1/100 lambda (632.8nm) for surface figure and ~1/1000 lambda for RMS will be demonstrated. A 5~10 times improvement in surface roughness is expected over the current technique as the chemical removal is at the atomic or molecular level, rather than by particle bombardment on optical surface. The lower surface roughness will obviously reduce the scattering lose for the short wavelength range. In Phase II, we will extend the work to non-flat surfaces, ie, arbitrary shaped surfaces, and to other glasses and materials of interest to NASA.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
