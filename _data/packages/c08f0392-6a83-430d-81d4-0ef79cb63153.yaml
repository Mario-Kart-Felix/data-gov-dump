    systems in safety-critical applications is the software life-cycle: requirement
    engineering through verification and validation. Adaptive systems incorporate learning
    to adapt the control system to the current operating conditions of the system, certifying
    their performance is a complex and tedious process. Ongoing effort in the development
    of tools for verification and validation of adaptive control systems, there is little
    research directed at the development of analytical methods. Learning rules for adaptive
    systems derivation using Lyapunov's second method, is based on the derivation of
    an energy-type function whose derivative must be negative to guarantee convergence
    therefore the asymptotic stability of the system. The first problem is that Lyapunov's
    second method provides a sufficient condition for stability thus the synthesis of
    an appropriate Lyapunov function for a particular application is a major challenge.
    The second problem in many applications, including the design of adaptive neural
    flight control systems, it is only possible to prove that the derivative of the
    Lyapunov function is non-positive, rather than being negative. For practical purpose,
    it is only possible to conclude that the control system errors are ultimately bounded,
    and it not possible to estimate the magnitude of these errors or the time it takes
    for these errors to converge to their steady-state limits. The objective of this
    research project is to develop analytical methods for the analysis of adaptive neural
    networks (ANN) based flight control systems including analytical estimates of the
    settling time and the steady-state magnitudes of the error dynamics. The magnitudes
    of the error bounds will be related to the performance handling qualities of the
    system and provide very important information about the performance of the closed-loop
    system. ",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
