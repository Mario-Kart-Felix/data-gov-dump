This is importantnfor analysis of laminar to turbulent flow transitions, flow separationnand reattachment mechanisms, and other instabilities, during rotor bladenand fuselage design, blade tracking adjustments, and active flightncontrol.  The sensors act as mechano-electrical transducers to convertnair flow-induced tangential surface forces into electrical outputnsignals.  They are thin and surface-mounted so cause minimal interactionnwith the flow, are easy to apply as an appliqu, and require no cavitiesnor recesses other than holes to connect the sensor leads to datanacquisition wiring.  The material is resistant to normal aircraft fluidsnand solvents, can operate over a temperature range of -65 to +150C, andnis capable of withstanding moderate rain and dust erosion.   DuringnPhase II, NanoSonic will  Develop an improved understanding of thenoperation of thin film Metal RubberTM skin friction sensors,nStandardize sensor design and sensor fabrication processes,  Develop anmethod to calibrate sensor elements as part of manufacturing,  Develop anmeans to compensate for cross-sensitivity effects,  Develop and optimizenmeans for data acquisition,  Use developed sensors in cooperation withnthe NASA LaRC Subsonic Rotary Wing program to investigate rotorcraftnresearch and development problems, and  Use and demonstrate the sensorsnin cooperation industry and academic colleagues. The significance of thenproposed NASA Phase II SBIR program is in transitioning these sensorsnfrom analytical and FEM modeling to commercial products for experimentalnuse by NASA and industry.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
