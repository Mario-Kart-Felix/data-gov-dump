    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The space shuttle main engine (SSME) is
    part of the Main Propnlsion System (MPS) which is an extremely complex system containing
    several sub-systems and components, each of which must work precisely in order to
    achieve a successful mission. A critical component under study is the flow control
    valve (FCV) which controls the pressure of the gaseous hydrogen between the SSME
    and the external fuel tank. The FCV has received added attention since a Space Shuttle
    Mission in November 2008, where it was discovered during the mission that an anomaly
    had occurred in one of the three FCV's. Subsequent inspection revealed that one
    FCV cracked during ascent. This type of fault is of high criticality because it
    can lead to potentially catastrophic gaseous hydrogen leakage. A supervised learning
    method known as Virtual Sensors (VS), and an unsupervised learning method known
    as the Inductive Monitoring System (IMS) were used to detect anomalies related to
    the FCV in the MPS. Both algorithms identify the time of the anomaly in a multi-dimensional
    time series of temperatures, pressures, and control signals related to the FCV.
    This discovery corroborates the results of the inspection and also reveals the time
    at which the anomaly likely occurred. The methods were applied to data obtained
    from the March 2009 launch of Space Shuttle Discovery to determine whether an anomaly
    occurred inrnthe same sub-system. According to our models, the FCV SUb-system showed
    nominal behavior during ascent.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
