	"notes": "Alphacore, Inc. proposes to design and characterize a 24Gsps (giga-samples per-second), 6-bit, low-power, and low-cost analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for use in a wide range of NASA's microwave sensor based remote sensing applications.  The goal of this program is to provide an ultra-high-speed, low-power ADC that does both, provides excellent interfacing capabilities to top FPGAs and also has an optimized low-power spectrometer DSP backend available to be integrated on the same chip. The proposed ADC employs an innovative topology with high-bandwidth front-end sampling circuit combined with a flash-type ADC and encoder circuitry that simplifies FPGA interfacing. Innovative and effective digital calibration is used to guarantee spurious free Nyquist frequency band which is an important requirement in remote sensing applications.Comparable commercial ADCs are based on expensive and power-hungry bipolar transistor technologies such as indium phosphide (InP), gallium arsenide (GaAs) and silicon germanium (SiGe). Alphacore designs take advantage of the latest low-power, high-speed digital CMOS processes, resulting in ADC power consumption that is less than 1/8 of the power consumption of competitor ADCs. Using a CMOS process provides additional advantages in that we can leverage existing intellectual property (IP) to enhance the system-level integration of the ADC, e.g., on-chip digital calibration logic, data buffer memory, high-speed transceiver logic, and direct on-chip DSP capabilities.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
