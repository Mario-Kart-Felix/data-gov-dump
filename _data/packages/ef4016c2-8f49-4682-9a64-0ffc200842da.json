		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

The Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) is used to collect voluntarily submittedrnaviation safety reports from pilots, controllers and others. As such it is particularly usefulrnin researching aviation safety deficiencies. In this paper we address two challenges related to thernanalysis of ASRS data: (1) the unsupervised extraction of meaningful and interpretable topicsrnfrom ASRS reports and (2) multi-label classification of ASRS data based on a set of predefinedrncategories. For topic modeling we investigate the practical usefulness of Latent Dirichlet Allocationrn(LDA) when it comes to modeling ASRS reports in terms of interpretable topics. We alsornutilize LDA to generate a more compact representation of ASRS reports to be used in multi-labelrnclassification. For multi-label classification we propose a novel and highly scalable multi-label classificationrnalgorithm based on multi-variate regression. Empirical results indicate that our approachrnis superior to several baseline and state-of-the-art approaches.",
