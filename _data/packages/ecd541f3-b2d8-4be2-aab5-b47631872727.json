	"notes": "The Pawnee radar data for the Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E) held in Oklahoma were collected on May 24, 2011 to support the CHILL radar and the NASA ER-2 instrumentation data.  The Pawnee is a single polarization (V polarization) Doppler radar which was located at approx. azimuth 352 deg \/ range 48 km with respect to CHILL.  The half-power antenna pattern main lobe beamwidth is ~1.8 degrees.  During the ER2 flight, the Pawnee conducted a wide azimuth opening PPI sector volume scan oriented towards the east designed to provide general 3D coverage of the ER2 flight area.  When the ER2 reported starting a course reversal; the CHILL and Pawnee radars attempted to start sector scans at the same time to support dual Doppler wind analyses.  In an effort to expand the MC3E sampling to a wider geographical area, the NASA ER2 aircraft was directed to Northeastern Colorado while widespread rain was in progress on May 24 2011.  The aircraft flew a series of pre-defined ground tracks that coincided with radials from the CSU-CHILL radar.  This aided in keeping the aircraft in the plane of a series of RHI scans done by CSU-CHILL.  The single polarization CSU-Pawnee radar maintained volume coverage of the echo system while the radial flight legs were in progress.  During aircraft course reversals at the ends of the radial legs, the CHILL and Pawnee radars started volume scans in synchronization to support dual Doppler wind syntheses.  CHILL and Pawnee radar data are available as separate datasets.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
