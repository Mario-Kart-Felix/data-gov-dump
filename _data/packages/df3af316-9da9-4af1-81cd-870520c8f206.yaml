    Radiation Data (CLDT) at 6.7 and 11.5 microns data product contains radiances expressed
    in units of W/m2/sr measured in the 10.5 - 12.5 (11.5) micron and 6.5 - 7.0 (6.7)
    micron channels. The data, originally written on IBM 360 machines, were recovered
    from magnetic 9-track tapes. The data are archived in their original proprietary
    format.nnThe Nimbus-7 satellite was successfully launched on October 28, 1978. The
    Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer (THIR) experiment on Nimbus-7 is basically
    identical to its predecessors flown on Nimbus-4, -5 and -6, except that the data
    were digitized on board. The THIR instrument is a two channel high resolution scanning
    radiometer designed to perform two major functions:nn* 11.5 micron channel provides
    both day and night cloud top or surface temperatures. The ground resolution at the
    sub-point is 6.7 km and operates day and night.nn* 6.7 micron channel gives information
    on the moisture content of the upper troposphere and stratosphere and the location
    of jet streams and frontal systems. The water vapor channel has a resolution of
    the sub-point is 20 km and operates mostly at night.nnThe THIR Principal Investigator
    was Dr. Larry L. Stowe from NOAA NESDIS. The Nimbus-7 THIR data are available from
    October 30, 1979 (day of year 303) through May 13, 1985 (day of year 133).nnThese
    data were previously archived at NASA NSSDC under the entry ID ESAD-00107 (old id:
    78-098A-10C).",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
