  health information in operational decision making, especially when fused with information
  about future operational, environmental, and mission requirements, is becoming desirable
  for both manned and unmanned aerospace vehicles. A vehicle capable of evaluating
  its own health state and making (or assisting the crew in making) decisions with
  respect to its system health evolution over time will be able to go further and
  accomplish more mission objectives than a vehicle fully dependent on human control.
  This paper describes the development of a hardware testbed for integration and testing
  of prognostics-enabled decision making technologies. Although the testbed is based
  on a planetary rover platform (K11), the algorithms being developed on it are expected
  to be applicable to a variety of aerospace vehicle types, from unmanned aerial vehicles
  and deep space probes to manned aircraft and spacecraft. A variety of injectable
  fault modes is being investigated for electrical, mechanical, and power subsystems
  of the testbed. A software simulator of the K11 has been developed, for both nominal
  and off-nominal operating modes, which allows prototyping and validation of algorithms
  prior to their deployment on hardware. The simulator can also aid in the decision-making
  process. The testbed is designed to have interfaces that allow reasoning software
  to be integrated and tested quickly, making it possible to evaluate and compare
  algorithms of various types and from different sources. Currently, algorithms developed
  (or being developed) at NASA Ames - a diagnostic system, a prognostic system, a
  decision-making module, a planner, and an executive - are being used to complete
  the software architecture and validate design of the testbed.\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
