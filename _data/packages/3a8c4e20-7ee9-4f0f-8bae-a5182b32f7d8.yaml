    2B 12.5km Version 1.1 science-quality ocean surface wind vectors. The Level 2B wind
    vectors are binned on a 12.5 km Wind Vector Cell (WVC) grid and processed using
    the Level 2A Sigma-0 dataset. RapidScat is a Ku-band dual beam circular rotating
    scatterometer retaining much of the same hardware and functionality of QuikSCAT,
    with exception of the antenna sub-system and digital interface to the International
    Space Station (ISS) Columbus module, which is where RapidScat is mounted. The NASA
    mission is officially referred to as ISS-RapidScat. Unlike QuikSCAT, ISS-RapidScat
    is not in sun-synchronous orbit, and flies at roughly half the altitude with a low
    inclination angle that restricts data coverage to the tropics and mid-latitude regions;
    the extent of latitudinal coverage stretches from approximately 56 degrees North
    to 56 degrees South. Furthermore, there is no consistent local time of day retrieval.
    This dataset is provided in netCDF-4 "classic" format and made available via FTP
    and OPeNDAP. For data access, please click on the "Data Access" tab above. This
    Version 1.1 dataset differs from the previous Version 1 dataset as follows: 1) A
    new neural network approach for high wind speeds provided rain corrections for the
    "retrieve_wind_speed" variable for wind speeds in excess of 15 m/s. 2) The data
    variables containing the number of measurements of each type for each wind vector
    cell have been corrected; these variables include "number_in_aft", "number_in_fore",
    "number_out_aft", and "number_out_fore". 3) The "wind_obj" data variable has
    been corrected to include the proper data for the conditional probability for the
    objective DIRTH function values. It is advised for users to avoid using the "wind_obj"
    variable in this dataset since it is minimally applicable and meant primarily for
    quality assurance; for users who wish to access the objective function values for
    each ambiguity, it is suggested to use only the "ambiguity_obj" variable. The
    "wind_obj" variable contains DIRTH probabilities (which are derived form the "ambiguity_obj"
    objective function values) in the range of 0 to 1 indicating the conditional probability
    that the true direction is within + or - 2.5 degrees of the retrieved wind direction
    given the observed backscatter measurements in the cell. If you have any questions,
    please contact podaac@podaac.jpl.nasa.gov",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
