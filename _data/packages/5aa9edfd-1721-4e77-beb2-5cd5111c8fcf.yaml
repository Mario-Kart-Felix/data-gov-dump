    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Elevated salt and selenium levels in groundwater
    and in saline seeps within the Lake Basin of northern Stillwater County, Montana
    have impacted water quality on Hailstone National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), and have
    the potential to impact water quality at Halfbreed NWR. Additionally, the contribution
    of salts and selenium from saline seeps creates an unacceptable risk to aquatic
    birds using Hailstone NWR. This study was conducted to evaluate the background hydrogeologic
    conditions, selenium source and geochemistry, as well as the distribution of selenium
    and other constituents of concern, and their impacts to waterfowl and shorebirds
    using Hailstone and Halfbreed NWRs in south-central Montana. This report emphasizes
    the Hailstone NWR because all waterbodies at Halfbreed NWR were dry for the duration
    of this investigation. Upper Cretaceous marine shale, along with alluvium and colluvium
    derived from these shales, provide the source of selenium and sulfate salts to Hailstone
    Reservoir. Prior to crop-fallow farming practices, native prairie grasses consumed
    most of the precipitation. Crop-fallow farming altered the hydrologic balance and
    precipitation unused by plants moved below the root zone and accumulated. Groundwater
    recharge accumulated in the alluvium, colluvium and weathered shale above low permeability
    shales causing the water table to rise and a groundwater-flow system to develop.
    Selenium, sulfate salts, and other harmful constituents were dissolved and moved
    down-gradient with the groundwater through alluvium, colluvium and weathered shale.
    A groundwater transition zone developed as the water table rose. Subtle rises in
    the topography of the impermeable shale beds and thinning alluvium forced groundwater
    towards the land surface. Saline seeps develop along these transition zones. Selenium
    and sulfate salts are evapoconcentrated in these seeps as the groundwater reaches
    the surface and evaporates. In Hailstone Basin, runoff from snowmelt and rain storms
    dissolves these salts as it moves downslope towards Hailstone Reservoir carrying
    selenium concentrations as high as 3,200 u00b5g/L and sulfate ions as high as 60,000
    mg/L. Groundwater below the transition zone has very high sulfate concentrations
    but relatively low selenium concentrations. Slow moving groundwater containing relatively
    low selenium concentrations and high sulfate concentrations also discharge into
    Hailstone Reservoir, although runoff appears to be the primary source of lake water,
    and is the source of most of the constituents of concern. Saline seep induced changes
    to water quality on Hailstone NWR were found to negatively impact waterfowl and
    shorebirds using the reservoir. Several mortality events related to high salt concentrations
    were noted during this investigation. In addition, a hazard assessment completed
    for selenium revealed that Hailstone Reservoir has the potential to cause complete
    reproductive failure in sensitive waterfowl and shorebirds. The Service is currently
    unable to manage water levels within Hailstone Reservoir in order to avoid future
    mortality events.",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras":
