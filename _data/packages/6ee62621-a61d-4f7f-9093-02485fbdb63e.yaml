    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The recorded harvest between 25 April and
    8 June in Gambell was 1499 walruses. There were 373 adult males, 528 adult females,
    405 calves, and 193 of unknown sex. Adult refers to animals older than calves yet
    not necessarily sexually mature. This was the largest harvest recorded in Gambell
    in the last 5 years and perhaps in recent history. Several factors influenced the
    high harvest. The last two of three strikes on bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus)
    was lost 26 April and walrus hunting commenced 29 April. Although this was 2 weeks
    earlier than the walrus hunt in 1983 (Sease 1983), it was a week or more later than
    the bunts in 1982 (Malloy 1982) and 1981 (Lourie 1981). However, not catching a
    whale certainly motivated the hunters to bring in more walrus meat. There were 26
    days during the 1984 monitoring period when walrus were captured as opposed to 20
    days in 1983 and 19 days in 1982. Ice and wind conditions were such that hunters
    had greater access to walrus than the previous three years. During the 1982 and
    1983 monitoring periods, there were only two days each year on which more than 100
    walrus were retrieved. During the 1984 monitoring session, the catch exceeded 100
    walrus on six days (Table 2). The hunters were reporting large herds and good ice
    conditions. Small amounts of ice persisted until 1 June which was the last day 15
    or more walrus were retrieved. The shore ice on the north beach held fast until
    2 June. It seemed that thick ice capable of supporting walrus persisted a week longer
    in 1984 than the previous 3 seasons. Proportionately more females and calves were
    caught during the 1984 monitoring session than during 1981 (chi-square 16.34, 2
    df) or during 1983 (chi-square 23.48, 2 df, Table 3). More male walrus were taken
    than expected during the 1984 season when compared to 1982 (chi-square 8.23, 2 df).
    The distribution of hunting days relative to the walrus migration probably explains
    the differences in sex composition between years. There were fewer hunting days
    at the end of May and the beginning of June during 1982 than 1983 or 1984 (Malloy
    1982, Sease 1983). This year there were more hunting days in April and early May
    than during 1983. Female and calf walrus are the first to migrate and tend to stay
    with thicker ice (Fay 1982). Male walrus migrate later and were taken in greater
    numbers by Gambell hunters during the end of May and beginning of June. Female and
    calf walrus are preferred for their meat in Gambell and are taken in large numbers
    early in the hunting season.",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras":
