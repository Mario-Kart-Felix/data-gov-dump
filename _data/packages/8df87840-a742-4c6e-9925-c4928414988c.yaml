    files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information
    from then               U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically
    Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The
    MTDB representsn               a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps
    between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as
    an independent datan               set, or they can be combined to cover the entire
    nation. The TIGER/Line Files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and
    census designatedn               places or CDPs (statistical entities). An incorporated
    place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people
    as opposed ton               a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created
    to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.
    Placesn               always nest within a State, but may extend across county and
    county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village,
    orn               borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated
    for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.
    CDPsn               are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of
    population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under
    the laws ofn               the State in which they are located. The boundaries for
    CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and/or tribal officials
    and usuallyn               coincide with visible features or the boundary of an
    adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change
    from one decennialn               census to the next with changes in the settlement
    pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not
    necessarily have then               same boundary. The only population/housing size
    requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing
    and population. Then               boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places
    are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation
    Survey (BAS).n               The boundaries of all 2010 Census CDPs were delineated
    as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).",nt"license_title":
