  States. The Private Non-Retail Shipping layer contains motor carrier freight terminals
  for some of largest trucking companies in the U.S. (as measured by revenue reported
  by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics). Entities from the following companies
  are included> United Parcel Service (UPS) > Yellow Freight System > Schneider >
  Roadway Express > FedEx > Con-Way Transportation > ABF Freight System > DHL > Corporate
  headquarters and other locations that do not actually handle freight are not included.
  No data could be obtained for Consolidated Freightways, Ryder Integrated Logistics,
  RPS and J.B. Hunt Transport Services. Facilities associated with these companies
  are not included in this dataset even though these companies have more annual revenue
  that some of the companies that are represented in this dataset. Many smaller, but
  still significant, companies have been excluded due to resource constraints. Examples
  include United Van Lines, Overnite Transportation, and American Freightways. Rail,
  air, sea, pipeline and inter-modal terminals are not included unless they are operated
  by one of the companies represented in this dataset. Facilities associated with
  the United States Postal Service (USPS) are not included. This dataset does not
  include retail shipping stores, drop boxes, and transportation operations that are
  not operated for hire. No entities located in American Samoa, The Northern Mariana
  Islands or the Virgin Islands are included in this dataset. The companies represented
  in this dataset are involved in the parcel delivery / courier service business or
  the freight service provider business. Parcel delivery / courier services deliver
  parcels, packages and other small shipments that typically weight less than 100
  pounds according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. A freight service provider
  can include motor carriers, for-hire carriers and freight forwarders. According
  to the United Shippers Corporation, a motor carrier is defined as a company that
  provides truck transportation. A for-hire carrier is defined as a company that provides
  truck transportation of cargo belonging to others and is paid for doing so. A freight
  forwarder is defined as a company that arranges for truck transportation of cargo
  belonging to others, utilizing for-hire carriers to provide the actual truck transportation.
  The forwarder does assume the responsibility for the cargo from origin to destination
  and usually does take possession of the cargo at some point during the transportation.
  Forwarders typically assemble and consolidate less-than-truckload shipments into
  truckload shipments at origin and disassemble and deliver less-than-truckload shipments
  at destination. The intention of TGS is to include only those entities that meet
  the above definition. TGS was not able to contact all of the entities in this layer
  to verify that they met this definition, therefore some entities may be included
  in this layer that do not meet the definition. Text fields in this dataset have
  been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results.
  All diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced
  with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database
  systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated
  by the [CONTDATE] attribute. Based upon this attribute the oldest record dates from
  09/08/2006 and the newest record dates from 10/03/2006.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
