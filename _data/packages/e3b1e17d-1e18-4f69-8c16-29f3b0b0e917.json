	"notes": "Many diagnostic datasets suffer from the adverserneffects of spikes that are embedded in data and noise. Forrnexample, this is true for electrical power system data wherernthe switches, relays, and inverters are major contributors tornthese effects. Spikes are mostly harmful to the analysis ofrndata in that they throw off real-time detection of abnormalrnconditions, and classification of faults. Since noise andrnspikes are mixed together and embedded within the data,rnremoval of the unwanted signals from the data is not alwaysrneasy and may result in losing the integrity of therninformation carried by the data. Additionally, in somernapplications noise and spikes need to be filteredrnindependently. The proposed algorithm is a multi-resolutionrnfiltering approach based on Haar wavelets that is capable ofrnremoving spikes while incurring insignificant damage tornother data. In particular, noise in the data, which is a usefulrnindicator that a sensor is healthy and not stuck, can bernpreserved using our approach. Presented here is therntheoretical background with some examples from a realisticrntestbed.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
