    photographs of the Earth's surface with a telescopic camera system and transported
    the exposed film through the use of recovery capsules. The capsules or buckets were
    de-orbited and retrieved by aircraft while the capsules parachuted to earth. The
    exposed film was developed and the images were analyzed for a range military applications.
    The Keyhole (KH) satellite system KH-9 (Hexagon) operated between 1971 and 1984.
    The imagery generated are of historical interest and expected to support current
    scientific research on climate change and related fields of inquiry. Almost all
    of the imagery from this camera was declassified in 2012 as a continuation of Executive
    Order 12951, the same order that declassified CORONA. A subset of this declassified
    data was transferred to the U.S. Geological Survey's Earth Resources Observation
    and Science (EROS) Center. Please check the coverage map in EarthExplorer to verify
    the extent of coverage for the subset of images available from EROS. The Available
    images are primarily over the United States, Antarctica, and the Arctic Circle.
    The KH-9 program was designed to support mapping requirement and exact positioning
    of geographical points for the military. The KH-9 panoramic cameras captured high
    resolution (2-4 feet) images and the terrain camera captured high resolution (2-4
    feet) images and the terrain camera captured moderate resolution (20-30 feet) images.
    High resolution images were acquired on 6.5 inch wide variable length film. The
    moderate resolution terrain camera acquired images that were printed to 9 inch wide
    variable length film. The digital products are produced from a duplicate positive
    film source. The use of browse imagery provides an opportunity to determine if the
    area of interest is covered and to check for cloud cover. The original film sources
    are maintained by the (http://www.archives.gov) National Archives and Records Administration
    (NARA).",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key": "responsible-party",ntt"value":
