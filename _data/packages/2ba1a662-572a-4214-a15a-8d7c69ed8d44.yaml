    geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore of Point Reyes map area, California.
    The vector data file is included in "Geology_OffshorePointReyes.zip," which is
    accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshorePointReyes/data_catalog_OffshorePointReyes.html.
    Marine geology and geomorphology was mapped in the Offshore of Point Reyes map area
    from approximate Mean High Water (MHW) to the 3-nautical-mile limit of Californiau2019s
    State Waters. MHW is defined at an elevation of 1.46 m above the North American
    Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) (Weber and others, 2005). Offshore geologic units
    were delineated on the basis of integrated analyses of adjacent onshore geology
    with multibeam bathymetry and backscatter imagery, seafloor-sediment and rock samples
    (Reid and others, 2006), digital camera and video imagery, and high-resolution seismic-reflection
    profiles. The onshore bedrock mapping was compiled from Galloway (1977), Clark and
    Brabb (1997), and Wagner and Gutierrez (2010). Quaternary mapping was compiled from
    Witter and others (2006) and Wagner and Gutierrez (2010), with unit contacts modified
    based on analysis of 2012 LiDAR imagery; and additional Quaternary mapping by M.W.
    Manson. The morphology and the geology of the Offshore of Point Reyes map area result
    from the interplay between tectonics, sea-level rise, local sedimentary processes,
    and oceanography. The Point Reyes Fault Zone runs through the map area and is an
    offshore curvilinear reverse Fault Zone (Hoskins and Griffiths, 1971; McCulloch,
    1987; Heck and others, 1990; Stozek, 2012) that likely connects with the western
    San Gregorio fault further to the south (Ryan and others, 2008), making it part
    of the San Andreas Fault System. The Point Reyes Fault Zone is characterized by
    a 5 to 11 km-wide zone that is associated with two main fault structures, the Point
    Reyes Fault and the Western Point Reyes Fault (fig. 1). Tectonic influences impacting
    shelf morphology and geology are related to local faulting, folding, uplift, and
    subsidence. Granitic basement rocks are offset about 1.4 km on the Point Reyes thrust
    fault offshore of the Point Reyes headland (McCulloch, 1987), and this uplift combined
    with west-side-up offset of the San Andreas Fault (Grove and Niemi, 2005) resulted
    in uplift of the Point Reyes Peninsula, including the adjacent Bodega and Tomales
    shelf. The Western Point Reyes Fault is defined by a broad anticlinal structure
    visible in both industry and high-resolution seismic datasets and exhibits that
    same sense of vergence as the Point Reyes Fault. The deformation associated with
    north-side-up motion across the Point Reyes Fault Zone has resulted in a distinct
    bathymetric gradient across the Point Reyes Fault, with a shallow bedrock platform
    to the north and east, and a deeper bedrock platform to the south. Late Pleistocene
    uplift of marine terraces on the southern Point Reyes Peninsula suggests active
    deformation west of the San Andreas Fault (Grove and others, 2010) on offshore structures.
    The Point Reyes Fault and related structures may be responsible for this recent
    uplift of the Point Reyes Peninsula, however, the distribution and age control of
    Pleistocene strata in the Offshore of Point Reyes map area is not well constrained
    and therefore it is difficult to directly link the uplift onshore with the offshore
    Point Reyes Fault structures. Pervasive stratal thinning within inferred uppermost
    Pliocene and Pleistocene (post-Purisima) units above the Western Point Reyes Fault
    anticline suggests Quaternary active shortening above a curvilinear northeast to
    north-dipping Point Reyes Fault zone. Lack of clear deformation within the uppermost
    Pleistocene and Holocene unit suggests activity along the Point Reyes Fault zone
    has diminished or slowed since 21,000 years ago. In this map area the cumulative
    (post-Miocene) slip-rate on the Point Reyes Fault Zone is poorly constrained, but
    is estimated to be 0.3 mm/yr based on vertical offset of granitic basement rocks
    (McCulloch, 1987; Wills and others, 2008). With the exception of the bathymetric
    gradient across the Point Reyes Fault, the offshore part of this map area is largely
    characterized by a relatively flat (<0.8u00b0) bedrock platform. The continental
    shelf is quite wide in this area, with the shelfbreak located west of the Farallon
    high , about 35 km offshore. Sea level has risen about 125 to 130 m over about the
    last 21,000 years (for example, Lambeck and Chappell, 2001; Peltier and Fairbanks,
    2005), leading to broadening of the continental shelf, progressive eastward migration
    of the shoreline and wave-cut platform, and associated transgressive erosion and
    deposition (for example, Catuneanu, 2006). Land-derived sediment was carried into
    this dynamic setting, and then subjected to full Pacific Ocean wave energy and strong
    currents before deposition or offshore transport. Much of the inner shelf bedrock
    platform is composed of Tertiary marine sedimentary rocks, which are underlain by
    Salinian granitic and metamorphic basement rocks, including the Late Cretaceous
    porphyritic granite (unit Kgg), which outcrops on the seafloor south of the Point
    Reyes headland. Unit Kgg appears complexly fractured, similar to onshore exposures,
    with a distinct massive, bulbous texture in multibeam imagery. The Tertiary strata
    overlying the granite form the core of the Point Reyes syncline (Weaver, 1949) and
    include the early Eocene Point Reyes Conglomerate (unit Tpr), mid- to late Miocene
    Monterey Formation (unit Tm), late Miocene Santa Margarita Formation (unit Tsm),
    late Miocene Santa Cruz Mudstone (unit Tsc), and late Miocene to early Pliocene
    Purisima Formation (unit Tp). The Point Reyes Conglomerate is exposed on the seafloor
    adjacent to onshore outcrops on the Point Reyes headland and has a distinct massive
    texture with some bedding planes visible, but the strata are highly fractured. Based
    on stratigraphic correlations from seismic reflection data and onshore wells, combined
    with multibeam imagery, we infer rocks of the early Eocene Point Reyes Conglomerate
    extend at least 6 km northwest from onshore exposures at Point Reyes headland. The
    absence of unit Tsc in onshore wells (Clark and Brabb, 1997) suggests these rocks
    are unlikely to occur within the Tertiary section of this map area, north of the
    Point Reyes Fault. In this map area, unit Tu represents seafloor outcrops of a middle
    Miocene to upper Pliocene sequence overlying unit Tpr, that may include units Tm,
    Tsm, and Tp. Seafloor exposures of unit Tu are characterized by distinct rhythmic
    bedding where beds are dipping and by a mottled texture where those beds become
    flat-lying. Modern nearshore sediments are mostly sand (unit Qms and Qsw) and a
    mix of sand, gravel, and cobbles (units Qmsc and Qmsd). The more coarse-grained
    sands and gravels (units Qmsc and Qmsd) are primarily recognized on the basis of
    bathymetry and high backscatter. The emergent bedrock platform north and west of
    the Point Reyes headland is heavily scoured, resulting in large areas of unit Qmsc
    and associated Qmsd. Both Qmsc and Qmsd typically have abrupt landward contacts
    with bedrock and form irregular to lenticular exposures that are commonly elongate
    in the shore-normal direction. Contacts between units Qmsc and Qms are typically
    gradational. Unit Qmsd forms erosional lags in scoured depressions that are bounded
    by relatively sharp and less commonly diffuse contacts with unit Qms horizontal
    sand sheets. These depressions are typically a few tens of centimeters deep and
    range in size from a few 10's of meters to more than 1 km2. There is an area of
    high-backscatter, and rough seafloor southeast of the Point Reyes headland that
    is notable in that it includes several small, irregular "lumps", with as much
    as 1 m of positive relief above the seafloor (unit Qsr). Unit Qsr occurs in water
    depths between 50 and 60 meters, with individual lumps randomly distributed to west-trending.
    This area on seismic-reflection data shows this lumpy material rests on several
    meters of latest Pleistocene to Holocene sediment and is thus not bedrock outcrop.
    Rather, it seems likely that this lumpy material is marine debris, possibly derived
    from one (or more) of the more than 60 shipwrecks offshore of the Point Reyes Peninsula
    between 1849 and 1940 (National Park Service, 2012). It is also conceivable that
    this lumpy terrane consists of biological "hardgrounds". Video transect data crossing
    unit Qsr near the Point Reyes headland was of insufficient quality to distinguish
    between these above alternatives. A transition to more fine-grained marine sediments
    (unit Qmsf) occurs around 50u201360 m depth within most of the map area, however,
    directly south and east of Drakes Estero, backscatter and seafloor sediment samples
    (Chin and others, 1997) suggest fine-grained sediments extend into water depths
    as shallow as 30 m. Unit Qmsf is commonly extensively bioturbated and consists primarily
    of mud and muddy sand. These fine-grained sediments are inferred to have been derived
    from the Drakes Estero estuary or from the San Francisco Bay to the south, via predominantly
    northwest flow at the seafloor (Noble and Gelfenbaum, 1990). References Cited Catuneanu,
