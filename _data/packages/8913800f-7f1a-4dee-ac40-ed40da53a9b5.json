	"notes": ""CODE (COrps DEvelopment) STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) ? Moon Mars and Beyond; DLESE-Powered On-Line Classroom" shares the excitement of President Bush's vision of space exploration with 8th grade students. Program fulfills standards-based 8th grade curriculum and will be implemented in two diverse Escondido schools (Grant, Rincon). San Diego County Office of Education will ensure relevance and integration into formal curriculum.  Through thematic approach to learning and multi-disciplinary exhibit-centered final project, Program strives to engage broad cross-section of students and teachers.  rnrnFocus is on developing a theme-specific DLESE (Digital Library for Earth System Education) collection and portal. On-line learning communities and inquiry based learning protocols (San Diego State University) will enhance DLESE effectiveness. Implementation culminates with multi-disciplinary student exhibit at participating schools and San Diego Aerospace Museum, sharing excitement of space exploration with general public. In Phase II DLESE collection will be expanded to support additional grade levels (3rd, 5th, 8th, high school), there will be broad implementation in San Diego and Nashville (through Fisk University), and teacher training.rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
