  density, moisture content, respiration rates and decomposition rate constants in
  csv format from Manaus Brazil measured from 1/1/1996 through 12/31/1997. The data
  for respiration reports CO2 flux from coarse litter (trunks and large branches >
  10 cm diameter) that was studied in central Amazon forests (Chambers et al. 2001).
  The respiration study took place during the transition from wet to dry season of
  1997 (June-August),and sampling from the decomposition study (Chambers et al. 2000)
  was carried out during both the dry and wet seasons of 1996-97 (see below). Respiration
  rates varied over almost two orders of magnitude (1.003-0.014 micro g C g-1 C min-1,
  n=61), and were significantly correlated with wood density (r2adj = 0.42), and moisture
  content (r2adj = 0.39). Additional samples taken from a nearby pasture indicated
  that wood moisture content was the most important factor controlling respiration
  rates across sites (r2adj = 0.65). Based on average coarse litter wood density and
  moisture content, the mean long-term carbon loss rate due to respiration was estimated
  to be 0.13 yr-1 (range of 95% prediction interval (PI) = 0.11-0.15 yr-1).Decomposition
  rate constants are reported as mass loss fraction per year, for boles of 155 large
  dead trees (> 10 cm diameter) in central Amazon forests (Chambers et al. 2000).
  The measurements were carried out over a 2-year period (1996-1997) on permanent
  plots monitored by the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) of
  the Smithsonian Institution (Lovejoy and Bierregaard 1990; Rankin-De Merona et al.
  1992) and the Biomass and Nutrient Experiment (BIONTE) of the National Institute
  for Amazon Research (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia-INPA). Mortality
  data from 21 hectares of permanent inventory plots, monitored for 10-15 years, were
  used to select dead trees for sampling. A single csv formatted data file includes
  dates when trees died, their diameter and breast height (DBH, i.e., at 1.3 m) and
  taxonomic information.Measured rate constants varied by over 1.5 orders of magnitude
  (0.015-0.67 /yr), averaged 0.19 /yr with predicted error averaging 0.026 /yr. Wood
  density and bole diameter were significantly and inversely correlated with rate
  constants. A tree of average biomass was predicted to decompose at 0.17 /yr.Understanding
  how tropical forest carbon balance will respond to global change requires knowledge
  of individual heterotrophic and autotrophic respiratory sources, together with factors
  that control respiratory variability. These data, along with estimates of ecosystem
  leaf, live wood and soil respiration, were used to estimate total carbon balance
  as described in Chambers et al (2004).\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S. Government

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
