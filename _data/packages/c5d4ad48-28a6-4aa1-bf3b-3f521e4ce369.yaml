    managing uncertainty and complexity to regression and classification in the form
    of Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), and to state estimation via Particle Filters
    (PF), proves to be a powerful tool to integrate the diagnosis and prognosis of battery
    health. Accurate estimates of the state-of-charge (SOC), the state-of-health (SOH)
    and state-of- life (SOL) for batteries provide a significant value addition to the
    management of any operation involving electrical systems. This is especially true
    for aerospace systems, where unanticipated battery performance may lead to catastrophic
    failures.rnrnBatteries, composed of multiple electro- chemical cells, are complex
    systems whose internal state variables are either inaccessible to sensors or hard
    to measure under operational conditions. In addition, battery performance is strongly
    influenced by ambient environmental and load conditions. Consequently, inference
    and estimation techniques need to be applied on indirect measurements, anticipated
    operational conditions and historical data, for which a Bayesian statistical approach
    is suitable. Accurate models of electro-chemical processes in the form of equivalent
    electric circuit parameters need to be combined with statistical models of state
    transitions, aging processes and measurement fidelity, need to be combined in a
    formal framework to make the approach viable. The RVM, which is a Bayesian treatment
    of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), is used for diagnosis as well as for model
    development. The PF framework uses this model and statistical estimates of the noise
    in the system and anticipated operational conditions to provide estimates of SOC,
    SOH and SOL. Validation of this approach on experimental data from Li-ion batteries
    is presented.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
