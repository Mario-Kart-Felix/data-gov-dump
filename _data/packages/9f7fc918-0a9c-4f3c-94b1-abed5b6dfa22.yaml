    bathymetric contours for several seafloor maps of the Offshore of Bodega Head map
    area, California. The vector data file is included in "Contours_OffshoreBodegaHead.zip,"
    which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreBodegaHead/data_catalog_OffshoreBodegaHead.html.
    10-m interval contours of the Offshore of Bodega head map area, California, were
    generated from bathymetry data collected by California State University, Monterey
    Bay (CSUMB) and by Fugro Pelagos. Mapping was completed between 2007 and 2010, using
    a combination of 200-kHz and 400-kHz Reson 7125, and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam
    echosounders, as well as 468-kHz SEA SWATHPlus interferometric system. These mapping
    missions combined to collect bathymetry from about the 10-m isobath to beyond the
    3-nautical-mile limit of California State Waters. Bathymetric contours at 10-m intervals
    were generated from a bathymetric surface model. The most continuous contour segments
    were preserved while smaller segments and isolated island polygons were excluded
    from the final output. Contours were smoothed via a polynomial approximation with
    exponential kernel (PAEK) algorithm using a tolerance value of 60 m. The contours
    were then clipped to the boundary of the map area. These data are not intended for
    navigational purposes.",nt"owner_org": "bd2cdd5a-4d65-46c0-9937-c8381175f104",nt"extras":
