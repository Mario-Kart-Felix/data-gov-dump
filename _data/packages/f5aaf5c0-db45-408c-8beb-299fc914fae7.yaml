    space missions, among which autonomous communication technologies are extremely
    beneficial to future missions. Communication technologies will expand mankind's
    understanding of planet earth and the universe. As the needs to gather more data,
    even more advanced antenna technologies will be essential to deliver orders of magnitude
    more data. Low cost high data-rate flexible active digital beam forming phased array
    antenna (PAA) is one of the enabling technologies. Graphene is one-atom-thick planar
    sheet of carbon atoms that has mobility of charge carriers in excess of 200,000
    cm2V&amp;#8722;1s&amp;#8722;1. It is the lowest resistivity substance known at room
    temperature. The extremely low resistivity makes graphene the next generation conductor
    that we are going to use as interconnects and antenna elements. Graphene also has
    supreme mechanical properties extremely suitable for flexible electronics. It is
    lighter, stronger, harder and more flexible than steel. Furthermore, it is a recyclable
    and sustainably manufacturable product that is eco-friendly. Another advantage of
    graphene antennas is that due to the reduced wave propagation speed of graphene,
    the size of antenna can be reduced to a factor of 10, which is critical for the
    routing and power dissipation for large number element arrays.  rnrnPrototype of
    a fully graphene-based 4-bit 4-element digital beam forming PAA on flexible substrate
    such as Kapton, including antennas, field effect transistor (FET) switches and phase
    shifters will be developed. Performance features of the flexible PAA will be characterized
    including frequency/bandwidth, gain/efficiency, and power consumption. The flexible
    high-speed electronics will enable active PAA deployment for NASA's lunar mission,
    including pressurized rovers, pressurized habitats, surface navigation, EVA, and
    etc.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras": [{ntt"key":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
