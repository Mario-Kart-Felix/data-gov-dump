	"notes": "The Souris River, an international river originating in Canadau2019s Saskatchewan Province, flows south into the State of North Dakota and then back north into Canadau2019s Manitoba Province. In North Dakota, the river flows through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serviceu2019s 58,700 acre J. Clark Salyer National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge). The Refuge extends approximately 50 miles south from the North Dakota/Manitoba border. The international Souris River Bilateral Water Quality Monitoring Group collects and analyzes water quality samples at specific locations on the Souris River to ensure compliance with trans-boundary water quality objectives and meet the terms of the 1989 International Agreement. Analyses of samples collected in Canada downstream of the Refuge and its impoundments have shown consistent exceedences for several water quality parameters. To address these water quality concerns, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serviceu2019s Environmental Contaminants Program calculated a nutrient budget for the Refuge; identified sources of and quantified nutrient loading; and evaluated methods to reduce loading to the system, subsequently improving Refuge habitat, trophic condition of Refuge pools, and possible downstream water quality. Field work for this investigation was conducted in 1999-2001. 1999 was a flood year for all inflows to the Refuge (total inflow discharge [acre-feet] was 460% of long-term mean). 2000 was a drought year with total inflow discharge (acre-feet) to the Refuge only 60% of long-term mean. Three sources of nutrient loading to the Refuge were quantified (inflows, atmospheric wet deposition, and snow goose excrement). Inflows contributed 99% of total nitrogen and 99% of total phosphorus to the refuge in 1999, and 84% and 99% respectively in 2000. Atmospheric deposition was not a contributor of total phosphorus in either year, and contributed 1% and 2% of the total nitrogen in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Snow goose excrement was an insignificant contributor of total phosphorus or total nitrogen in both years (<1%). During this investigation, exceedences of transboundary water quality objectives occurred downstream of the Refuge with no greater frequency then exceedences in inflows upstream of the Refuge, while concentrations in the Refuge pools were consistently lower than concentrations downstream of the Refuge. Possible explanations for downstream exceedences are discussed in the report. The total nitrogen/total phosphorus ratios indicate the Refuge pools are nitrogen limited, thus susceptible to blue-green algae blooms. Calculated trophic status indexes coupled with water quality data show the Refuge aquatic habitat as a whole is a boarder-line mesotrophic/eutrophic aquatic system. Nutrient fluxes from pool sediments to the above water column were calculated through in-situ isolation of sediments and corresponding water column. As dissolved oxygen decreased in the water column, large fluxes of dissolved phosphorus from the sediments were measured. The mean dissolved phosphorus release from sediments among the Refuge pools was nearly 60 mg/m2/day. Under both a high-flow and low-flow year, the tributaries, Willow, Stone, and Boundary Creeks consistently had high concentrations of nutrients, ions, dissolved and suspended solids, and fecal coliforms. Water quality on the Refuge would likely improve with implementation of best management practices within the watersheds of these three tributaries.",
