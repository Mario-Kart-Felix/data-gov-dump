    Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, from 2010-01-21 to 2010-04-24, reef fish assessment surveys were
    conducted, as a part of Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA), during the Pacific Reef
    Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruise HA1001 in the Pacific Remote Island
    Areas region by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands
    Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). During the cruise, 30 REA sites were surveyed
    at Jarvis in the Pacific Remote Island Areas region. At each REA site, fish biologists
    entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~700 m^2) and high degree of taxonomic
    resolution REA survey to assess and monitor species diversity, size distribution,
    and abundance of fish in shallow-water hard-bottom (less than 30 m) habitats. Reef
    fish assessment surveys were focused on cataloging the diversity (species richness),
    abundance (numeric density) and biomass (fish mass per unit area) of diurnally active
    reef fish assemblages. The stationary point count (SPC) method was used to quantify
    reef fish species. Two divers lay out a 30 m transect line, and position themselves
    at the 7.5 and 22.5 meter marks. The SPC biologist then records estimated size and
    abundance of all fish within a visually estimated 15-m diameter cylinder centered
    on the stationary diver (7.5-m radius, total area ~ 177m^2 per cylinder). The diver
    first spends 5 minutes identifying all fish species in the cylindrical area, then
    proceeds to count and estimate size (total length) for each in a series of "instantaneous"
    point counts or sweeps of the cylinder. Fish were identified at the species level,
    wherever possible. All reef-associated fish, including those in the water column,
    were surveyed. The survey time for each stationary point count survey was approximately
    20 min and generally four stationary point count surveys (two per diver) were conducted
    at each fish REA site. After completing REA surveys, divers noted the presence,
    at the survey site, of any unusual fish species not counted during SPC counts, in
    order to facilitate species lists per location.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
