    record" of the acreage of Federal and non-federal lands within the park boundaries."
    Recently the Land Resources Division (LRD) has begun creating GIS files of the tract
    and boundary data for each NPS unit. These GIS files are based on the NPSu00e2u0080u0099s
    reasonable interpretation of each units supporting legal documentation. Such documentation
    includes but is not limited to legislation, deeds, legal descriptions, land status
    maps, and survey plats. Director's Order #25 goes on to state that "While these
    maps are the official record of the lands and acreage within the unitu00e2u0080u0099s
    authorized boundaries, they are not of survey quality and not intended to be used
    for survey purposes." This data was created in response to the Deepwater Horizon
    Oil Spill and is subject to the following restrictions: Property ownership data
    is compiled from deeds, plats, surveys, and other source data. These are not engineering

    or implied, as to the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of these data. It is
    strongly recommended that these data are directly acquired from an NPS server and
    not indirectly through other sources which may have changed the data in some way.
