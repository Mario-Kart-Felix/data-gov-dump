    categories to Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency (MRWPCA) facilities
    between Marina and Wharf II. These risk categories were determined by assuming that
    current long-term historic erosion rates would continue over the next 50 years.
    For this Coastal RSM Plan assessment of critical areas of erosion, the historic
    erosion rate results of Thornton et al. (2006) are used with an increment of approximately
    20% added to the erosion rate for potential increases due to future sea-level rise.
    The risk categories are: Low risk - facilities with a low probability of being impacted
    by erosion over the next 50 years. Moderate risk - facilities not likely to be affected
    by chronic erosion over the next 50 years, but potentially susceptible to short-term
    storm event erosion within the planning horizon. High risk - facilities that are
    located seaward of the shoreline position anticipated in 50 years or presently vulnerable
    to short-term event-based erosion. A high risk designation also applies to facilities
    with shore protection (presently or approved), where erosion is impacting public
    safety and access, and reducing the shoreline recreational value.Future erosion
    rates could be lower if beach-sand mining ceases. In this case, moderate and high
    risk facilities would have a larger buffer zone of protection, and management action
    could be delayed beyond the time lines recommended in this Coastal RSM Plan. Conversely,
    erosion rates may increase if future sea-level rise accelerates over the predicted
    estimates (Section 2.4), and management may need to be more immediate.All the facilities
    identified as at high or moderate risk of erosion were then assessed as to their
    future value. This assessment is based on the SMBCEW (2006c) evaluation of the economic
    (potential loss of facility), environmental (potential loss of habitat), and safety
    and human health (potential loss of life) consequences of loss of the facility.
    The facilities are designated as high consequence, moderate consequence, or low
    consequence. The shapefile was compiled by Southern Monterey Bay Coastal Erosion
    Workgroup and PWA and submitted to CSMW as part of the Southern Monterey Bay Coastal
    Regional Sediment Management Plan (AMBAG, 2008).",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":
