  conditions where un-modeled effects are present as manifested by the different degradation
  curve at 45u00b0C. Although all algorithms were given the same amount of information
  to the degree practical, there were considerable differences in performance. Specifically,
  the combined Bayesian regression-estimation approach implemented as a RVM-PF framework
  has significant advantages over conventional methods of RUL estimation like ARIMA
  and EKF. ARIMA, being a purely data-driven method, does not incorporate any physics
  of the process into the computation, and hence ends up with wide uncertainty margins
  that make it unsuitable for long-term predictions. Additionally, it may not be possible
  to eliminate all non-stationarity from a dataset even after repeated differencing,
  thus adding to prediction inaccuracy. EKF, though robust against non-stationarity,
  suffers from the inability to accommodate un-modeled effects and can diverge quickly
  as shown. We did not explore other variations of the Kalman Filter that might provide
  better performance such as the unscented Kalman Filter. The Bayesian statistical
  approach, on the other hand, appears to be well suited to handle various sources
  of uncertainties since it defines probability distributions over both parameters
  and variables and integrates out the nuisance terms. Also, it does not simply provide
  a mean estimate of the time-to-failure; rather it generates a probability distribution
  over time that best encapsulates the uncertainties inherent in the system model
  and measurements and in the core concept of failure prediction.\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
