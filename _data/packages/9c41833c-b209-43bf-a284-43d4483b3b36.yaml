    replacement of hexavalent chrome [Cr (VI)] in the processing of aluminum for high-reliability
    electronics applications in the aviation and aerospace sector remains a goal of
    great significance.&amp;nbsp; Aluminum is the major structural manufacturing material
    used for avionics type packages both the aircraft (military and commercial) and
    space flight arena.&amp;nbsp; The processing and maintenance of this material against
    degradation and corrosion is of prime importance to the electronics community in
    preserving our defense and space operations capabilities.&amp;nbsp; This includes
    preserving the integrity of the structure and electronics components within, maintaining
    proper electrical conductivity, and minimizing impact on radio and electromagnetic
    interference qualities of the electronics package.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key
    to the operability and preservation of aluminum substrates for electronic housings
    and avionics has been the use of chromated coatings, typically conversion coatings
    on interior spaces and coating systems (conversion coatings, primers) for exteriors
    and sometimes hard-chrome plating. Hard chrome plating on components is accomplished
    through an electrochemical process; the electrochemically adhered chrome provides
    barrier protection to the substrate by forming a dense self-healing oxide layer
    on the surface.&amp;nbsp; Though some electronics applications may use hard-chrome
    plating, it is outside of the scope of this project.&amp;nbsp; Conversely, with
    applied coatings, the high corrosion resistance offered by chromated films is attributed
    to the presence of both hexavalent and trivalent chromium in the coating.&amp;nbsp;
    The trivalent chromium is present as an insoluble hydrated oxide, whereas the hexavalent
    chromium imparts a &amp;ldquo;self-healing&amp;rdquo; character to the coating during
    oxidative (corrosive) attack.&amp;nbsp; Hexavalent chrome coatings also play a critical
    role in supporting and enhancing the adhesion of the primer coating to the substrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occupational
    Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) studies have determined that hexavalent
    chromium poses significant medical risks to users.&amp;nbsp; Hexavalent chromium
    is considered a potential lung carcinogen.&amp;nbsp; Studies of workers in the chromate
    production, plating, and pigment industries consistently show increased rates of
    lung cancer.&amp;nbsp; It has also been shown that direct eye contact with chromic
    acid or chromate dusts can cause permanent eye damage.&amp;nbsp; Hexavalent chromium
    can irritate the nose, throat, and lungs and repeated or prolonged exposure can
    damage the mucous membranes of the nasal passages and result in ulcers.&amp;nbsp;
    In severe cases, exposure causes perforation of the septum (the wall separating
    the nasal passages).&amp;nbsp; It has also been proven that prolonged skin contact
    can result in dermatitis and skin ulcers. Some workers develop an allergic sensitization
    to chromium and kidney damage has been linked to high levels of dermal exposures.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
