    manufacturing provides the opportunity to build replacement parts on-demand and
    repair structure to change the paradigm for space exploration mission supportability.&amp;nbsp;
    Advanced Manufacturing technology such as additive manufacturing and electron beam
    welding are being developed and utilized on earth but have not yet been adapted
    to an in-space system context.&amp;nbsp; The objective of this project is to demonstrate
    the concept of operations for an in-space manufacturing system.&amp;nbsp; Due to
    the small-scale of this project and the large cost of advanced manufacturing technology
    systems, sub-element technology demonstrations were completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additive
    manufacturing concept of operations was demonstrated with the help of JSC&amp;rsquo;s
    integrated Power, Avionics, and Software facility.&amp;nbsp; A data connection was
    created between the iPAS flight computer in Houston, TX and LaRC&amp;rsquo;s Electron
    Beam Freeform Fabrication (EBF3) additive system in Hampton, VA to simulate remote
    manufacturing.&amp;nbsp; Crew displays and controls were developed and integrated
    with the iPAS Flight Deck of the Future.&amp;nbsp; A technology demonstration was
    completed as part of the iPAS asteroid demonstration.&amp;nbsp; Finally, metal and
    plastic material specimens and parts were fabricated for structural testing and
    evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space structure repair was tested by evaluating weld-positioning
    capability of the Dexterous Manipulator Trainer (DMT), the ground version of the
    Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) currently on the International Space
    Station.&amp;nbsp; DMT positioning testing determined that the SPDM would be useful
    for gross positioning but fine positioning would be too challenging.&amp;nbsp; JSC&amp;rsquo;s
    Robonaut, which is still in development, was also tested and performed more adequately
    for fine positioning tasks, though it&amp;#39;s still unclear if it performed well-enough
    for on-orbit welding. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
