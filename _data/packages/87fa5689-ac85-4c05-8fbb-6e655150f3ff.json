	"notes": "Automated Contingency Management (ACM), or the ability to confidently and autonomously adapt to fault conditions with the goal of still achieving mission objectives, can be considered the ultimate technological goal of a health management system.  In an innovative Phase I STTR program, Impact Technologies and Georgia Institute of Technology developed a prototype Test Bench software for developing and validating ACM systems.  With the Phase II support of Boeing/Rocketdyne, the primary goal of this project is to further develop and demonstrate a design and development tool for ACM technologies called the Propulsion ACM Test Bench, and to develop specific ACM solutions within this environment for Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). The commercial-grade software to be delivered at the conclusion of Phase II will utilize technologies based on open-systems, modular software architectures suitable for 3rd party system integration.  Two such modules of note for the Test Bench include an Integration Toolkit for Livingstone2&lt;SUP&gt;TM&lt;/SUP&gt; as a Reasoner and a Validation and Verification Toolkit for health management algorithms and the ACM system design.  This technology is expected to provide immediate benefit to the SSME program and a comprehensive, SSME software demonstration is planned at the conclusion of the 2 year effort.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
