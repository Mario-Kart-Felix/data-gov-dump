  of the rural water intervention proposes two separate approaches so as to ensure
  a u201cdefensive evaluationu201d that is, so that results can be obtained in spite
  of unforeu00adseen events or mishaps. One is a phased randomized control trial (RCT)
  in which 100 water sysu00adtems were allocated (roughly) equally to treatment (i.e.,
  early treatment) and control (i.e., late treatu00adu00adment) groups within each
  of the ten districts of Lesou00adtho. The other is a continuous treatu00adment-variable
  (CTV) model in which the intensity of treatment can be estimated without the need
  to isolate a separate control group. As we shall see, while our revised design provides
  techu00adniques to overcome the threats to internal validity that delayed implementation
  created for the RCT design, there are compelling reasons to give a greater role
  to the CTV approach as well as to carry out endu00adline surveys.nnThe original
  evaluation design, developed under NORC's first contract with MCC, focused on a
  randomized design, under which NORC, with MCA planned for a 6-9 month gap between
  the end of construction and rehabilitation of treatu00adment water projects (in
  50 Phase-A villages) and the start of water prou00adjects in the control areas (in
  50 Phase-C villages) to ensure sufficient time for impact to be realized in all
  outcomes of interest. A nine month gap would allow us to meau00adsure long-term
  outcomes such as changes in productivity and income, while a six-month gap would
  limit the impact analysis to short-term and intermediate outcomes. Under the original
  design, all Phase-A villages had a largely similar construction timeline with concurrent
  start and end dates of construction; thus, it was reasonable to expect that there
  would be a nine-month (or, at a minimum, a six-month) lag between the end of construction
  of the 50 Phase-A villages and the start of construction of the 50 Phase-C villages.nnDelays
  in the construction of Phase-A (early treatment) water systems, resulted in 11 treatment
  villages (Phase-A1 villages) underu00adgoing construction concurrently with the
  Phase-C control villages. This overu00adlap has called into question the validity
  of the original evaluation design and the effiu00adcacy of adminu00adistering an
  endu00adline. As Table 1 in the Evaluation Design Report demonstrates, construction
  was completed in only 70 peru00adcent of Phase-A vilu00adlages (34 of the 50) 9
  months before construction commenced in Phase-C conu00adtrol villages. For these
  34 villages - which belong to the Phase-Arev group - the time of exposure to treatment
  before controls began receiving treatment between in January 2013 range from 10
  to 20 months. Since the midu00adline data collection preceded the start of construction
  in Phase-C villages (i.e., Novemu00adber to December, 2012), duration of exposure
  to treatment by the time of midline data collection for these 34 Phase-Arev villages
  was about 9-19 months. Five villages in Phase Arev and all 11 Phase-A1 villages
  had not been exposed to treatment by the time of midline data colu00adlecu00adtion.
  The reduction of the treatment sample at midline by 30 percent has implications
  for the stau00adtistical power of the evaluation design to detect impacts at the
  level genu00aderally desired by MCC.nnThe Evaluation Design Report discusses the
  implications of construction delays for the evaluation design, indicates what evaluation
  questions can and cannot be addressed without an endline, and discusses the pros
  and cons of alternative design strau00adteu00adgies to deal with the unforeseen
  complications in implementation.n      \",\n\t\"license_title\": \"License Not Specified\",\n\t\"extras\":
