    was to provide the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS) staff
    with information on biogeographic patterns within the Sanctuary. This specific project
    focused on the development of a plan to spatially and quantitatively characterize
    the fish communities in relatively shallow waters throughout the Sanctuary (<110
    ft). This collaboration also included the initial implementation of that plan. The
    FGBNMS represents the northernmost tropical western Atlantic coral reef on the continental
    shelf and support the most highly developed offshore hard bank community in the
    region. The complexity of habitats supports a diverse assemblage of organisms including
    approximately 250 species of fish, 23 species of coral, and 80 species of algae
    in addition to large sponge communities. Understanding and monitoring these resources
    is critical to both sanctuary inventory and management activities. Monitoring of
    the biological communities has taken place at FGBNMS since the 1970s. This work
    has focused primarily on monitoring the benthos with video transects and photostations
    documenting transitions between coral, algae and sponge communities over time. Until
    relatively recently, little has been done to monitor or characterize the reef fish
    community. In 1994 the Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) began surveys
    of the Sanctuary and utilized a combination of REEF personnel, volunteers, and Sanctuary
    staff to visually census reef fish populations via roving diver surveys. These surveys
    have been invaluable in terms of species list development and understanding the
    ranges of these species. Subsequently, a stationary point-count survey technique
    was utilized to begin to quantify community metrics such as species abundance and
    trophic structure at selected locations. These data provide an important starting
    point for characterizing the fish community; however, they are limited in scope
    of inference to small portions of the Sanctuary coral cap environment and are therefore
    difficult to utilize in developing population estimates at the scale of the Sanctuary.",nt"owner_org":
