    of its kind in space, isn                        an electronically scanning radar,
    operating at 13.8 GHz that measuresn                        the 3-D rainfall distribution
    over both land and ocean, and definesn                        the layer depth of
    the precipitation.n                        n                        The objectives
    of 2A25 is to correct for the rain attenuation inn                        measured
    radar reflectivity and to estimate the instantaneousn                        three-dimensional
    distribution of rain from the TRMM Precipitationn                        Radar (PR)
    data.  The estimates of attenuation-corrected radarn                        reflectivity
    factor and rainfall rate are given at each resolutionn                        cell
    of the PR.  The estimated near-surface rainfall rate and averagen                        rainfall
    rate between the two pre-defined altitudes (2 and 4 km) aren                        also
    calculated for each beam position.n                        n                        2A25
    basically uses a hybrid of the Hitschfeld-Bordan method and then                        surface
    reference method to estimate the vertical true radarn                        reflectivity
    (Z) profile.  (The hybrid method is described in Iguchin                        and
    Meneghini (1994)).  The vertical rain profile is then calculatedn                        from
    the estimated true Z profile by using an appropriate Z-Rn                        relationship.n
                           n                        The attenuation correction is,
    in principle, based on the surfacen                        reference method. This
    method assumes that the decrease in then                        apparent surface
    cross section (delta sigma-zero) is caused by then                        propagation
    loss in rain. The coefficient a in the k-Z relationship,n                        k=a
    Z**b, is adjusted in such a way that the path-integratedn                        attenuation
    (PIA) estimated from the measured Zm-profile will matchn                        the
    delta sigma-zero.  The attenuation correction of Z is carried outn                        by
    the Hitschfeld-Bordan method with the modified a.  Since a isn                        adjusted,
    this type of surface reference method is called then                        a-adjustment
    method.  The a-adjustment method assumes that then                        discrepancy
    between the PIA estimate from delta sigma-zero and thatn                        from
    the measured Zm-profile can be attributed to the inappropriaten                        choice
    of a values, which may vary depending on the raindrop sizen                        distribution
    and other conditions.  It assumes that the radar isn                        properly
    calibrated and that the measured Zm has no error.n                        n                        In
    order to avoid inaccuracies in the attenuation correction when rainn                        is
    weak, a hybrid of the surface reference method and then                        Hitschfeld-Bordan
    method is used (Iguchi and Meneghini, 1994).  Then                        PIA is
    first estimated from the precipitation echo alone.  The weightn                        given
    by the hybrid method to the PIA estimate from the surfacen                        reference
    increases as the attenuation estimate increases.  When rainn                        is
    very weak and the attenuation estimate is small, the PIA estimaten                        from
    the surface reference is effectively neglected.  With then                        introduction
    of the hybrid method, the divergence associated with then                        Hitschfeld-Bordan
    method is also prevented.n                        n                        One major
    difference from the method described in the above referencen                        is

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
