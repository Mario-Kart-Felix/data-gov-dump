	"notes": "The need for in-flight event detection and monitoring systems is clear. To address this and other safety and security needs, IEM proposed the Reactive In-flight Multisensor Security System (RIMSS) an affordable system which would improve safety and security within an aircraft by:rn?detecting abnormal events (including but not limited to unusual passenger/crew activities, losses of pressure, deviations from flight plan, movement or fire in cargo areas, etc.)rn?automatically alerting the crew to these eventsrn?recording the entire eventrnrnPhase I demonstrated that this system was feasible, practical, and well positioned to assist in NASA's Protected Asset Flight System (PAFS). In Phase II, IEM will develop a full prototype of RIMSS featuring:rn?an innovative and unique multisensor data fusion engine, IEM's Smart Sensor Situation Understanding System Architecture (S3USA)rn?unique hardware (optics, DSP-based integrated processor, imaging and acoustic arrays)rn?Proprietary and innovative software (object/event detection, identification, tracking, biometrics, etc.)rn?aircraft certified automatic communication with ground stations when events detectedrn?compression for video over limited bandwidthrn?other innovations as detailed. rnrnBoeing's Phantom Works is keenly interested in RIMSS' potential for aircraft safety monitoring, and will assist in the development and demonstration of RIMSS.rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
