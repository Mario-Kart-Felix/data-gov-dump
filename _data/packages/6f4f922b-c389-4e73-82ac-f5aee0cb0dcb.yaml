    in Heu2019eia Stream and Wetland was characterized through the use of a food-web
    model to predict effects to the Hawaiian stilt, chosen as a representative species
    for all waterbirds. It was assumed that risk estimates for Hawaiian stilt would
    support management decisions that would be protective enough for other avian receptors
    as well as native aquatic biota. Risk estimation involved a hazard quotient methodology
    to calculate critical exposure levels for individual stilt. If an exposure point
    concentration exceeded the critical exposure level for a particular CPEC, then the
    potential for adverse ecological effects was indicated. The model predicted that
    seven of the CPECs (total DDT, dieldrin, PCB Aroclors 1254 and 1260, barium, manganese,
    and vanadium) posed some level of ecological risk. The majority of exposure to organic
    CPECs in this model was obtained through fish consumption. Exposure to risk-posing
    metals was variably partitioned among fish, invertebrate, and sediment consumption.
    Based on the results of the field study, exposure assessment, ecological effects
    assessment, food-web model, and lines of evidence examined, all but five CPECs were
    eliminated from further consideration in the risk assessment. The five contaminants
    identified to constitute a risk to ecological receptors in He'eia Stream and He'eia
    Wetland were total DDT, dieldrin, PCB Aroclor 1254, barium, and manganese. Since
    indications of potential adverse effects to offsite ecological receptors were not
    necessarily the result of past practices at the Omega Station, the distribution
    patterns of these five CPECs in sediments and tissues were closely evaluated for
    evidence of their relationship to the Omega Station site. Results of this evaluation
    were as follows: Total DDT and Dieldrin - appeared to be attributable to a local
    source of DDT in the vicinity of lower Heteia Stream. PCB Aroclor 1254 - insufficient
    data to attribute or disqualify the Omega Station as the source. Barium - may be
    attributable to Omega Station activities. Manganese - data indicate a depleted source
    that is equally affecting the lower stream and wetland system at He'eia. It is possible
    that this source may be the Omega Station. Due to the overall level of uncertainty
    in the risk assessment and the fact that contaminant "hot spots" in Heteia Stream
    and He'eia Wetland have not been delineated, contaminants found offsite of the Omega
    Station do not warrant cleanup at this time. However, additional studies targeting
    PCB Aroclor 1254, barium, and manganese are justified since these were shown to
    pose ecological risk and could potentially have come from the Omega Station. He'eia
    Wetland is a dynamic environment, affected by intermittent flooding and drying.
    Therefore, organic contaminants may be widely dispersed. Several follow-up studies
    were recommended to help clarify the need for delineation and cleanup of contaminant
    "hot spotsu201d caused by past activities at the Omega Station. The following general
    conclusions were drawn from the ecological risk assessment: * The main receiving
    medium of concern is sediments, which may contain residual levels of contaminants
    transported from the Omega Station site. * The primary exposure pathways are ingestion
    of contaminated sediment and bioaccumulation along the food web. * Dieldrin was
    the most ubiquitous contaminant found in this study. With the highest hazard quotient
    and strong lines of evidence, it appeared to pose the greatest relative risk to
    He'eia Stream and Wetland receptors. However, the Omega Station was not shown to
    be a source of dieldrin contamination. * The lines of evidence presented herein
    suggested that there is little to no risk of acute or short-term chronic impacts
    to ecological receptors in He'eia Stream and Wetland. However, no predictions can
    be made regarding the long-term survival, growth, and reproduction of native aquatic
    biota, endangered waterbirds, and migratory birds.",nt"license_title": "License
