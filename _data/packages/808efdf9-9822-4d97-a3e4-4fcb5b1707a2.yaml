    (NHIS) is the principal source of information on the health of the civilian noninstitutionalized
    population of the United States and is one of the major data collection programs
    of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) which is part of the Centers
    for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The National Health Survey Act of 1956
    provided for a continuing survey and special studies to secure accurate and current
    statistical information on the amount, distribution, and effects of illness and
    disability in the United States and the services rendered for or because of such
    conditions. The survey referred to in the Act, now called the National Health Interview
    Survey, was initiated in July 1957. Since 1960, the survey has been conducted by
    NCHS, which was formed when the National Health Survey and the National Vital Statistics
    Division were combined.<br />nNHIS data are used widely throughout the Department
    of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to monitor trends in illness and disability
    and to track progress toward achieving national health objectives. The data are
    also used by the public health research community for epidemiologic and policy analysis
    of such timely issues as characterizing those with various health problems, determining
    barriers to accessing and using appropriate health care, and evaluating Federal
    health programs.<br />nThe NHIS also has a central role in the ongoing integration
    of household surveys in DHHS. The designs of two major DHHS national household surveys
    have been or are linked to the NHIS. The National Survey of Family Growth used the
    NHIS sampling frame in its first five cycles and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
    currently uses half of the NHIS sampling frame. Other linkage includes linking NHIS
    data to death certificates in the National Death Index (NDI).<br />nWhile the NHIS
    has been conducted continuously since 1957, the content of the survey has been updated
    about every 10-15 years. In 1996, a substantially revised NHIS questionnaire began
    field testing. This revised questionnaire, described in detail below, was implemented
    in 1997 and has improved the ability of the NHIS to provide important health information.</p>n",nt"license_title":
