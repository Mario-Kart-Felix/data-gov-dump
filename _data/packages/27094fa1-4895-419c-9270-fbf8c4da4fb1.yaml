  related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic
  information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated
  Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents
  a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line
  File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined
  to cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical
  subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants
  as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau
  delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or
  where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose
  of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation
  of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts
  generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum
  size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous
  with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.
  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.
  Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development,
  and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally
  are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population
  decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.
  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated
  place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental
  unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between
  censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the
  standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may
  consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census
  tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.
  For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced
  for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to
  Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized
  American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range
  9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or
  no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a
  National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code
  range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only
  water area, no land area.<br /><br /> This table contains housing data, including
  building age, value and/or rent, length of occupation, number of units, home heating
  type, and number of vehicles from the American Community Survey 2006-2010 database
  for tracts. The American Community Survey (ACS) is a household survey conducted
  by the U.S. Census Bureau that currently has an annual sample size of about 3.5
  million addresses. ACS estimates provides communities with the current information
  they need to plan investments and services. Information from the survey generates
  estimates that help determine how more than $400 billion in federal and state funds
  are distributed annually. Each year the survey produces data that cover the periods
  of 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year estimates for geographic areas in the United States
  and Puerto Rico, ranging from neighborhoods to Congressional districts to the entire
  nation. This table also has a companion table (Same table name with MOE Suffix)
  with the margin of error (MOE) values for each estimated element. MOE is expressed
  as a measure value for each estimated element. So a value of 25 and an MOE of 5
  means 25 +/- 5 (or statistical certainty between 20 and 30). There are also special
  cases of MOE. An MOE of -1 means the associated estimates do not have a measured
  error. An MOE of 0 means that error calculation is not appropriate for the associated
  value. An MOE of 109 is set whenever an estimate value is 0. The MOEs of aggregated
  elements and percentages must be calculated. This process means using standard error
  calculations as described in \"American Community Survey Multiyear Accuracy of the
  Data (3-year 2008-2010 and 5-year 2006-2010)\". Also, following Census guidelines,
  aggregated MOEs do not use more than 1 0-element MOE (109) to prevent over estimation
  of the error. Due to the complexity of the calculations, some percentage MOEs cannot
  be calculated (these are set to null in the summary-level MOE tables).\",\n\t\"license_title\":
