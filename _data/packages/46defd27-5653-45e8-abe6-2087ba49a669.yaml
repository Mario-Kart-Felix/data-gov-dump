    are conducted by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands
    Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) as part of biennial Pacific Reef Assessment and
    Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruises. These cruises support NOAA Coral Reef Conservation
    Program (CRCP) long-term goals for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems. 12 towboard surveys (22.4522 km in length), were conducted at Agrihan
    Island in the Marianas Archipelago from 19 August - 30 September 2003 as part of
    RAMP Cruise OES0307. Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general
    description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations
    of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution
    and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for
    assessing trends in these populations and metrics.u00c3u0082u00c2u00a0A pair of
    scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch
    at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min
    long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments.
    u00c3u0082u00c2u00a0The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied
    reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either side and 10m in front of the towboard.
    Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also
    outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record the survey swath.
    u00c3u0082u00c2u00a0The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae,
    estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates
    including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped
    with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15 second
    intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other
    benthic components. u00c3u0082u00c2u00a0Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD
    SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals. Latitude and
    longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using a Global
    Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. u00c3u0082u00c2u00a0A layback
    algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect
    to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based
    on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope,
    the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. u00c3u0082u00c2u00a0This
    metadata applies to the fish biomass observations.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
