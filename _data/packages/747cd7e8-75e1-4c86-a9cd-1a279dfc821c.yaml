    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;For the first two years of the
    project (FY12-13), the RadWorks project has consisted of two top-level elements.
    The first element involved the prototype and maturation of advanced, miniaturized
    radiation measurement technologies, and demonstration through available platforms
    of these technologies as integrated vehicle systems. The second element was the
    provision of ground based hardware and virtual demonstrators of radiation storm-shelter
    capabilities by providing multi-functionality in design elements, utilizing existing
    launch mass as compared to methods involving the addition of dedicated shielding
    mass. For FY14, the RadWorks project is continuing its maturation and prototyping
    of advanced, miniaturized radiation measurement technologies, along with their demonstrations.
    The RadWorks project will fly a simplified, non-integrated version of Radiation
    Environment Monitor (REM) aboard the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Exploration
    Flight Test 1 (EFT-1) to validate system operation in a space radiation environment
    and record charged particle data for post-flight analysis. This REM unit has been
    designated as the Battery-Operated Independent Radiation Detector (BIRD).&amp;nbsp;In
    addition, there are&amp;nbsp;6 REM sensors flying as Detailed Test Objectives (DTO)
    on the International Space Station (ISS). These sensors are plugged into laptops
    and are measuring the ionizing radiation environment. Work will continue on the
    development of the Hybrid Electronic Radiation Assessor (HERA) which is slated to
    fly first as a FTO (Flight Test Objective) on the MPCV Experimental Module 1 (EM-1)
    flight, and secondly, as an integrated part of the CWS (Caution &amp;amp; Warning
    System) on the MPCV Experimental Module 2 (EM-2) flight. Lastly, the RadWorks project
    will continue its development of an Advanced Neutron Spectrometer (ANS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also
    in FY14, the Storm Sheltering element of the project will transition away from specific
    shelter designs toward utilizing recently developed radiation modeling expertise,
    and modeling databases for comparison of simulation results to actual data. Comparative
    assessments will be conducted to correlate REM DTO data to radiation models, as
    applied to the current ISS configuration. Also, the RadWorks project will advance
    the development of radiation transport analytical software. This work will enable
    new designs and concepts of operation for radiation mitigation and protection of
    crew.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
