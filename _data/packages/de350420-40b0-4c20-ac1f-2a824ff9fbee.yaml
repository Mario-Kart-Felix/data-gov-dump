    Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, from 20120401 to 20120426, belt transect surveys of coral population
    and diseases quantitative assessments were conducted, as a part of Rapid Ecological
    Assessments (REA), during the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP)
    cruise HA1201 in American Samoa at periodic intervals between one and three years
    by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries
    Science Center (PIFSC). During the cruise, there were 6 surveys in total conducted
    at REA sites around Tau. At the specific REA sites, coral biologists along with
    algal biologists and marine invertebrate zoologist entered the water and conducted
    a fine-scale (approximately 300 m^2) and high degree of taxonomic resolution REA
    survey to assess and monitor species composition, abundance, percent cover, size
    distribution, diversity, and general health of corals, macro-invertebrates, and
    algae in shallow-water (less than 35 m) habitats. As a part of REA surveys, the
    coral belt surveys were focused on quantifying the diversity, abundance, density,
    and size-class distribution of the anthozoan and hydrozoan corals as well as the
    condition and health state of the coral reef populations. The surveys were conducted
    along two consecutively-placed, 25 m transect lines. The belt width was 1 m wide,
    0.5 m on each side of the transect line. Within each 25 m transect, five 2.5 m segments
    were surveyed (beginning at points: 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 meters), whereby in each
    segment, all coral colonies whose center fell within 0.5 m of either side of the
    transect line were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible (genus or species)
    and two planar size metrics were collected: maximum diameter and diameter perpendicular
    to the maximum diameter. In addition, the extent of mortality, both recent and old,
    was estimated for each colony. Observers paid special attention to identifying as
    best as possible the extent of the former live colony. When a coral colony exhibited
    signs of disease or compromised health, additional information was recorded including
    type of affliction (bleaching, skeletal growth anomaly, white syndrome, tissue loss
    other than white syndrome, trematodiasis, necrosis, other, pigmentation responses,
    algal overgrowth, and predation), severity of the affliction (mild, moderate, marked,
    severe, acute), as well as photographic documentation and occasional tissue samples.
    Tissue samples were cataloged and fixed in buffered zinc-formalin solution for further
    histopathological analyses. Raw survey data included species presence and relative
    abundance, colony counts per taxon, size (width and length), mortality, predation,
    and health status. A surveyed area was ranging from 10 m^2 to 25 m^2 per site.",nt"owner_org":
