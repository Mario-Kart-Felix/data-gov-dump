	"notes": "Trajectory-based operations (TBO) are at the forefront of the Next Generation Air Traffic Management System (NextGen). The vision of NextGen is one in which pilots will be responsible for following 4-dimensional (4D) trajectories while maintaining separation from other aircraft and weather. Ongoing research focuses heavily on the infrastructure and procedures required to conduct 4D TBO; however, new flight deck displays are going to be needed to support pilots who will be faced with the challenge of making more complex, strategic decisions than are required in current-day operations. In response to this challenge, Aptima proposes to develop a Trajectory-Based Operations Adaptive Information Display (TBO-AID). TBO-AID will incorporate innovative display techniques that address the (1) unique information needs associated with conducting 4D operations (e.g., crossing a specific navigation fix at a specific time); (2) uncertainty and risk associated with weather and mixed-equipage conditions, key challenges for conducting 4D TBO; (3) potential advantages gained through multimodal information presentation; and (4) need for model-based, situationally aware display adaptation to support information processing and decision making. Anticipated results of commercializing this effort include increasing the safety and efficiency of air traffic and expanding the maximum number of aircraft potentially in flight at a given time.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
