    and permanent visual descriptions of benthic organisms, benthic habitat composition,
    substrate complexity, and other unique features of the sites sampled during this
    mutlifaceted effort described below. The intent of this work is five fold: 1) To
    spatially characterize and monitor the distribution, abundance, and size of both
    reef fishes and macro-invertebrate (conch, lobster, Diadema); 2) To relate this
    information to in-situ data collected on water quality and associated habitat parameters;
    3) To use this information to establish the knowledge base necessary for enacting
    management decisions in a spatial setting; 4) To establish the efficacy of those
    management decisions; and 5) To work with the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program
    to develop data collection standards and easily implemented methodologies for transference
    to other agencies and to work toward standardizing data collection throughout the
    US states and territories. Toward this end, the Center for Coastal Monitoring and
    Assessment's Biogeography Team (BT) has has been conducting research in Puerto Rico
    and the US Virgin Islands since 2000 and 2001, respectively. It is critical, with
    recent changes in management at both locations (e.g. implementation of MPAs) as
    well as proposed changes (e.g. zoning to manage multiple human uses) that action
    is taken now to accurately describe and characterize the fish/macro-invertebrate
    populations in these areas. It is also important that BT work closely with the individuals
    responsible for recommending and implementing these management strategies. Recognizing
    this, BT has been collaborating with partners at the University of Puerto Rico,
    National Park Service, US Geological Survey and the Virgin Islands Department of
    Planning and Natural Resources. To quantify patterns of spatial distribution and
    make meaningful interpretations, we must first have knowledge of the underlying
    variables determining species distribution. The basis for this work therefore, is
    the nearshore benthic habitats maps (less than 100 ft depth) created by NOAA's Biogeography
    Program in 2001 and NOS' bathymetry models. Using ArcView GIS software, the digitized
    habitat maps are stratified to select sampling stations. Sites are randomly selected
    within these strata to ensure coverage of the entire study region and not just a
    particular reef or seagrass area. At each site, fish, macro-invertebrates, and associated
    water quality and habitat information is then quantified following standardized
    protocols. By relating the data collected in the field back to the habitat maps
    and bathymetric models, BT is able to model and map species level and community
    level information. These protocols are standardized throughout the US Caribbean
    to enable quantification and comparison of reef fish abundance and distribution
    trends between locations. Armed with the knowledge of where "hot spots" of species
    richness and diversity are likely to occur in the seascape, the BT is in a unique
    position to answer questions about the efficacy of marine zoning strategies (e.g.
    placement of no fishing, anchoring, or snorkeling locations), and what locations
    are most suitable for establishing MPAs. Knowledge of the current status of fish/macro-invertebrate
    communities coupled with longer term monitoring will enable evaluation of management
    efficacy, thus it is essential to future management actions.",nt"owner_org":
