    files (.dbf) are an extract of selectedn          geographic and cartographic information
    from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
    Encoding and Referencingn          (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents
    a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line
    shapefile isn          designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they
    can be combined to cover the entire nation.n          n          American Indian
    tribal subdivisions are administrative subdivisions of federally recognized American
    Indian reservations/off-reservation trust lands orn          Oklahoma tribal statistical
    areas (OTSAs).  These entities are internal units of self-government and/or administration
    that serve social, cultural, and/orn          economic purposes for the American
    Indian tribe or tribes on the reservations/off-reservation trust lands or OTSAs.
     The Census Bureau obtains the boundaryn          and attribute information for
    tribal subdivisions on federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation
    trust lands from federallyn          recognized tribal governments through the Census
    Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  For the 2010 Census, the boundaries
    for tribal subdivisionsn          on OTSAs were also obtained from federally recognized
    tribal governments through the Tribal Statistical Areas Program (TSAP).  Note that
    tribal subdivisionsn          do not exist on all reservations/off-reservation trust
    lands or OTSAs, rather only where they were submitted to the Census Bureau by the
    federally recognizedn          tribal government for that area.n          n          The
    boundaries for American Indian tribal subdivisions are as of January 1 of the public
    shapefile release year, as reported by the federally recognizedn          tribal
    governments through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).n           The
