		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

	"notes": "This data set records the productivity of a semiarid shortgrass prairie steppe located in the Central Plains Experimental Reserve (CPER)/Pawnee National Grassland in north-central Colorado. There are nine data files (.txt). Four files contain measurements of monthly dynamics of harvested above-ground plant biomass, one file each for untreated, irrigated, fertilized, and irrigated + fertilized plots for the period 1970 to 1975. The fifth file contains annual above-ground NPP estimates for the untreated plot for the period 1970-1974. The sixth file contains long-term ANPP estimated from field harvest measurements made between 1970 and 1990 and by correlation with forage production measurements made between 1939 and 1990. Two additional files provide estimates of above- and below-ground NPP based on peak growing season harvests; one record covers 1970-1972 from the Pawnee site and the other covers 1985-1988 from CPER. The ninth file contains climate data for 1912-1990 from a weather station located at CPER.Revision Notes: This data set has been revised to correct the study site elevation, extend the temporal coverage, and add four data files containing estimates of NPP. Please see the Data Set Revisions section of this document for detailed information. ",
