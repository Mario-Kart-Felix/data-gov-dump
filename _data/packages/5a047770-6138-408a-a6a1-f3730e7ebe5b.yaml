    point locations for the subset of Community Action for a Renewed Environment (CARE)
    grants given out by the US EPA. CARE is a competitive grant program that offers
    an innovative way for a community to organize and take action to reduce toxic pollution
    in its local environment. There are many limitations to the data so it is advised
    that these metadata be read carefully before use. Although the records for these
    grant locations are drawn directly from the official EPA grants repository (IGMS
    ufffd Integrated Grants Management System), it is important to know that the IGMS
    was designed for purposes that did not include accurately portraying the grantufffds
    place of performance on a map. Instead, the IGMS grant recipientufffds mailing address
    is the primary source for grant locations. Particularly for statewide grants that
    are administered via State and Regional headquarters, the grant location data should
    not be interpreted as the grantufffds place of performance. In 2012, a policy was
    established to start to collect the place of performance as a pilot for newly awarded
    grants ufffd that were deemed ufffdcommunity-basedufffd in nature and for these
    the grant location depicted in this database will be a more reliable indicator of
    the actual place of performance. As for the locational accuracy of these points,
    there is no programmatic certification process, however, they are being entered
    by the Grant Project Officers who are most familiar with the details of the grants,
    apart from the grantees themselves. Limitations notwithstanding, this is a first-of-breed
    attempt to map all of the Agencyufffds grants, using the best internal geocoding
    algorithms available, and is a useful tool for getting to an understanding of the
    distribution of USEPA grant-giving. The CARE Grants layer contains Places of Performance
    for single locations or areas where CARE grants are applied.",nt"license_title":
