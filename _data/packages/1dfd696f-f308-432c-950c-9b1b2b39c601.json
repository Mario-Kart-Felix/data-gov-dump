	"notes": "This data set provides mean leaf area index (LAI), dendrometry band measurements, and litterfall mass from samples collected at the km 67 research site, Topajos National Forest, Para, Brazil. Litterfall collections were from January 23, 2004 through December 3, 2004, dendrometer measurements were monthly between December 2003 and December 2004, and LAI measurements were collected from January 26, 2004 through November 3, 2004.All measurements were taken at the km 67 site in the Tapajos National Forest. This site is situated in an area of Amazonian primary tropical forest belonging to the municipality of Belterra, Para, Brazil. The forest is mostly evergreen with a few deciduous species. The canopy is characterized by large emergent trees up to 55-m tall, with a closed canopy at approximately 40-m; there are few indications of recent anthropogenic disturbance other than hunting trails. Measurement plots (50) were established along 4 transects at the site and within each plot, 5 subplots were established. The longest transect (25 m x 500 m) was the location of 20 (25 m x 25 m) plots. The other 3 transects (25 m x 250 m) contain 10 plots per transect. Note that the assignment of plots to transects is not provided.There are four comma-delimited data files (.csv) with this data set.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
