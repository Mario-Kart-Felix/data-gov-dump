  (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from
  the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
  Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless
  national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File
  is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to
  cover the entire nation. States and equivalent entities are the primary governmental
  divisions of the United States. In addition to the fifty States, the Census Bureau
  treats the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and each of the Island Areas (American
  Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin
  Islands) as the statistical equivalents of States for the purpose of data presentation.<br
  /><br /> This table contains data on race, age, sex, and marital status from the
  American Community Survey 2006-2010 database for states. The American Community
  Survey (ACS) is a household survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that currently
  has an annual sample size of about 3.5 million addresses. ACS estimates provides
  communities with the current information they need to plan investments and services.
  Information from the survey generates estimates that help determine how more than
  $400 billion in federal and state funds are distributed annually. Each year the
  survey produces data that cover the periods of 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year estimates
  for geographic areas in the United States and Puerto Rico, ranging from neighborhoods
  to Congressional districts to the entire nation. This table also has a companion
  table (Same table name with MOE Suffix) with the margin of error (MOE) values for
  each estimated element. MOE is expressed as a measure value for each estimated element.
  So a value of 25 and an MOE of 5 means 25 +/- 5 (or statistical certainty between
  20 and 30). There are also special cases of MOE. An MOE of -1 means the associated
  estimates do not have a measured error. An MOE of 0 means that error calculation
  is not appropriate for the associated value. An MOE of 109 is set whenever an estimate
  value is 0. The MOEs of aggregated elements and percentages must be calculated.
  This process means using standard error calculations as described in \"American
  Community Survey Multiyear Accuracy of the Data (3-year 2008-2010 and 5-year 2006-2010)\".
  Also, following Census guidelines, aggregated MOEs do not use more than 1 0-element
  MOE (109) to prevent over estimation of the error. Due to the complexity of the
  calculations, some percentage MOEs cannot be calculated (these are set to null in
  the summary-level MOE tables).<br /><br /> The name for table 'ACS10POPSTMOE' was
  added as a prefix to all field names imported from that table. Be sure to turn off
  'Show Field Aliases' to see complete field names in the Attribute Table of this
  feature layer. This can be done in the 'Table Options' drop-down menu in the Attribute
  Table or with key sequence '[CTRL]+[SHIFT]+N'. Due to database restrictions, the
  prefix may have been abbreviated if the field name exceded the maximum allowed characters.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
