    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "Model-based prognostics approaches rely
    on physics-based models that describe the behavior of systems and their components.
    These models must account for the several different damage processes occurring simultaneously
    within a component. Each of these damage and wear processes contribute to the overall
    component degradation. We develop a model-based prognostics methodology that consists
    of a joint state-parameter estimation problem, in which the state of a system along
    with parameters describing the damage progression are estimated, followed by a prediction
    problem, in which the joint state-parameter estimate is propagated forward in time
    to predict end of life and remaining useful life. The state-parameter estimate is
    computed using a particle filter, and is represented as a probability distribution,
    allowing the prediction of end of life and remaining useful life within a probabilistic
    framework that supports uncertainty management. We also develop a novel variance
    control algorithm that maintains an uncertainty bound around the unknown parameters
    to limit the amount of estimation uncertainty and, consequently, reduce prediction
    uncertainty. We construct a detailed physics-based model of a centrifugal pump that
    includes damage progression models, to which we apply our model-based prognostics
    algorithm. We illustrate the operation of the prognostic solution with a number
    of simulation-based experiments and demonstrate the performance of the approach
    when multiple damage mechanisms are active. ",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
