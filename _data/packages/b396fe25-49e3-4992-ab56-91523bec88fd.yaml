    with 3x3 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of the continental shelf off
    of Jacksonville, FL in the South Atlantic Bight, derived from data collected in
    2010. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with the University
    of South Florida, as well as the R/V Lost Coast Explorer , and private sector partners,
    acquired multibeam bathymetry data for deep coral research from 010/26/2010 to 10/27/2010.
    Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 710 multibeam echosounder
    (70 kHz). It was processed by the University of South Florida using CARIS HIPS software.
    Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced
    to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS.
    Data is in UTM Zone 17 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to
    generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. The CARIS Export option "BASE
    Surface to Image" was then used to create a GeoTiff of the priority areas.",nt"owner_org":
