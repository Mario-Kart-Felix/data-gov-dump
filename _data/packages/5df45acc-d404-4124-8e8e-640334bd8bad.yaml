    basins are in the southwestern part of the Mojave Desert in southern California.
    Ground water from these basins supplies a major part of the water requirements for
    the region. The continuous population growth in this area has resulted in ever-increasing
    demands on local ground-water resources. The collection and interpretation of ground-water
    data helps local water districts, military bases, and private citizens gain a better
    understanding of the ground-water flow systems, and consequently, water availability.
    During 2002, the U.S. Geological Survey and other agencies made approximately 2,500
    water-level measurements in the Mojave River and Morongo ground-water basins. These
    data document recent conditions and, when compared with previous data, changes in
    ground-water levels. A water-level contour map was drawn using data from about 660
    wells, providing coverage for most of the basins. Twenty-eight hydrographs show
    long-term (up to 70 years) water-level conditions throughout the basins, and 9 short-term
    (1997 to 2002) hydrographs show the effects of recharge and discharge along the
    Mojave River. In addition, a water-level-change map was compiled to compare 2000
    and 2002 water levels throughout the basins. In the Mojave River ground-water basin,
    about 66 percent of the wells had water-level declines of 0.5 ft or more since 2000
    and about 27 percent of the wells had water-level declines greater than 5 ft. The
    only area that had water-level increases greater than 5 ft that were not attributed
    to fluctuations in nearby pumpage was in the Harper Lake (dry) area where there
    has been a significant reduction in pumpage during the last decade. In the Morongo
    ground-water basin, about 36 percent of the wells had water-level declines of 0.5
    ft or more and about 10 percent of the wells had water-level declines greater than
    5 ft. Water-level increases greater than 5 ft were measured only in the Warren subbasin,
    where artificial-recharge operations have caused water levels to rise almost 60
    ft since 2000.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key": "bbox-east-long",ntt"value":
