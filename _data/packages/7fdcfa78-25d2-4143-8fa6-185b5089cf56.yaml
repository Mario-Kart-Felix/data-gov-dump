    a unit of local government for which the functions of ann               incorporated
    place and its county or minor civil division (MCD) have merged. Thisn               action
    results in both the primary incorporated place and the county or MCDn               continuing
    to exist as legal entities, even though the county or MCD performs few orn               no
    governmental functions and has few or no elected officials. Where this occurs, andn
                  where one or more other incorporated places in the county or MCD
    continue to functionn               as separate governments, even though they have
    been included in the consolidatedn               government, the primary incorporated
    place is referred to as a consolidated city. Then               Census Bureau classifies
    the separately incorporated places within the consolidatedn               city as
    place entities and creates a separate place (balance) record for the portionn               of
    the consolidated city not within any other place. The Economic Census consolidatedn
                  city shapefile is similar to the current shapefile except that the
