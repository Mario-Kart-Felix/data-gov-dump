	"notes": "**Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics Testbed (ADAPT)rnProject Lead: Scott Poll**rnrn**Subject**rnrnFault diagnosis in electrical power systemsrnrn**Description**rnrnThe Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics Testbed (ADAPT) lab at the NASA Ames Research Center aims to provide a means to assess the effectiveness of diagnostic algorithms at detecting faults in power systems. The algorithms are evaluated using data from the Electrical Power System (EPS), which simulates the functions of a typical aerospace vehicle power system. The EPS allows for the controlled insertion of faults in repeatable failure scenarios to test if diagnostic algorithms can detect and isolate these faults.rnrn**How Data Was Acquired**rnrnThis dataset was generated from the EPS in the ADAPT lab. Each data file corresponds to one experimental run of the testbed. During an experiment, a data acquisition system commands the testbed into different configurations and records data from sensors that measure system variables such as voltages, currents, temperatures and switch positions. Faults were injected in some of the experimental runs.rnrn**Sample Rates and Parameter Descriptions**rnrnData was sampled at a rate of 2 Hz and saved into a tab delimited plain text file. There are a total of 128 sensors and typical experimental runs last for approximately five minutes. The text files have also been converted into a MATLAB environment file containing equivalent data that may be imported for viewing or computation.rnrn**Faults and Anomalies**rnrnFaults were injected into the EPS using physical or software means. Physical faults include disconnecting sources, sinks or circuit breakers. For software faults, user commands are passed through an Antagonist function before being received by the EPS, and sensor data is filtered through the same function before being seen by the user. The Antagonist function was able to block user commands, send spurious commands and alter sensor data.rnrn**External Links**rnrnAdditional data from the ADAPT EPS testbed can be found at the DXC competition page - [https://dashlink.arc.nasa.gov/topic/diagnostic-challenge-competition/](https://dashlink.arc.nasa.gov/topic/diagnostic-challenge-competition/)rnrn**Other Notes**rnrnThe HTML diagrams can be viewed in any brower, but its active content is best run on Internet Explorer.

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
