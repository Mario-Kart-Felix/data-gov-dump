	"notes": "The massive acoustic loads produced by launch vehicles can detrimentally affect the proper functioning of vehicle components, payloads, and launch support structures. The high-velocity and high temperature rocket engine exhaust stream mixes with ambient atmosphere to generate intense acoustic loads, which account for the majority of structural vibration during launch. Ultramet has developed a unique, high temperature material that has demonstrated passive broadband sound attenuation over a range of frequencies and can withstand temperatures in excess of 1650 C (3000 F). In this project, Ultramet proposes to team with the Graduate Program in Acoustics at Pennsylvania State University (PSU) to develop and test a scale model to validate the impedance of this novel high temperature acoustic liner. An innovative, porous acoustic material will be developed that has demonstrated thermal, corrosion, acoustic, and mechanical load resistance at high temperatures, and porosity, pore size, pore shape, and material of construction will be varied to optimize mechanical and acoustic performance over a wide range of frequencies, amplitudes, and gas flow velocities and temperatures. Ultramet and PSU will also develop a basic numerical model to aid in the design of an economical and efficient liner exhaust duct system.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
