    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "This paper proposes a physics based degradation
    modeling and prognostics approach for electrolytic capacitors. Electrolytic capacitors
    are critical components in electronics systems in aeronautics and other domains.
    Degradation's in capacitor and MOSFET components are often the cause of failures
    in DC-DC converters. For example, prevalent fault effects, such as a ripple voltage
    surge at the power supply output, can damage interconnected critical subsystems
    leading to cascading fault propagation. Prognostics in general and in this case
    electronics components in particular is concerned with the prediction of remaining
    useful life (RUL) of components and systems. It performs a condition-based health
    assessment by estimating the current state of health. Furthermore, it leverages
    the knowledge of the device physics and degradation physics to predict remaining
    useful life as a function of current state of health and anticipated operational
    and environmental conditions. Physics-based models capture degradation phenomena
    in terms of component geometry and energy based principles that define the effect
    of stressors on the component behavior. This is in contrast to the traditional approach
    for deriving degradation models from empirical data. Implementing the degradation
     modeling techniquesrnpresent a general methodology for estimating lifetimes due
    to specific failure mechanisms. The failurernrate models can be tuned to include
    parameters that relate to the present health of the device/system and thernexpected
    conditions under which it will be operated. The models and algorithms are applied
    to data fromrndegradation experiments of several COTS capacitors. Results show the
    efficiency of the approach chosen.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
