	"notes": "The new Constellation vehicles, habitats and robots will be highlyrnsensored and generate large amounts of data.  For this data to bernuseful to humans monitoring these systems and to automated algorithmsrncontrolling these systems it will need to be converted into morernabstract data.  This abstracted data will reflect the trends andrncharacteristics of the systems and their environments.  Currently thisrndata abstraction process is manual and ad hoc.  It is manual in thernsense that either humans do the abstraction in their heads or the datarnabstraction is done by hand-coding computer programs for each datarnitem.  It is ad hoc in the sense that each data abstraction isrndeveloped on its own with no representation of how it relates to therntasks being performed or to other data abstractions.  In this projectrnwe propose building a Data Abstraction Architecture (DAA) that allowsrnengineers to design software processes that iteratively convertrnspacecraft data into higher and higher levels of abstraction.  The DAArnalso formalizes the relationships between data and control and thernrelationships between the data themselves.  The DAA consists ofrnrepresentations for data and data abstractions, a data store, arnabstraction architecture processing engine and a developmentrnenvironment.  We will evaluate the architecture using three NASArndomains: 1) a lunar outpost monitoring and control application; 2) arnrobotic scientific survey application; and 3) a vehicle procedurernexecution scenario.

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
