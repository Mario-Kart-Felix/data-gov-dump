    is a polygon shapefile that shows the distribution and classification of National
    Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) soil types. This shapefile represents
    the first attempt to assign reasonable NEHRP soil classifications to the geologic
    materials throughout Indiana. The NEHRP soil classifications are based on geologic
    and engineering response to earthquake-induced ground shaking. NEHRP links the physical
    properties of soils, such as shear strength and effect on shear-wave velocity propagation,
    to ensure a uniform classification for nonlithified materials in the context of
    their performance when subjected to seismically induced ground shaking. Ranked A
    through F, the correct NEHRP soil class is best determined from the average shear-wave
    velocity of the soil column. Attributes include the following NEHRP soil classes
    (Hill and Foshee, 2008, Table 1, p. 5): A - Hard rock; average shear-wave velocity
    greater than 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 0.08. Note that
    Class A is not present in Indiana. B - Rock; average shear-wave velocity 760 to
    1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.0. C - Hard and (or) stiff
    to very stiff soils, including most gravel; average shear-wave velocity 360 to 760
    meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.1 to 1.2. D - Sands, silts, and
    (or) stiff to very stiff clays, and some gravel; average shear-wave velocity 180
    to 360 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 1.6. E - Small to
    moderate thickness (10 to 50 feet), soft to medium-stiff clay, plasticity index
    greater than 20, moisture greater than 40 percent; average shear-wave velocity is
    less than 180 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 2.5. F - Soils
    vulnerable to potential failure or collapse under seismic loading, including liquifiable
    soils, quick and sensitive clays, and collapsible, weakly cemented soils; average
    shear-wave velocity is not applicable; amplification factor is not applicable. The
    following is excerpted from Indiana Geological Survey Report of Progress 35: "The
    distribution and classification of soil types are essential to understanding the
    response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by earthquakes. Thirty-seven
    shear-wave velocities were measured in soft sediments at various localities throughout
    Indiana, twenty-eight sites of which were measured using downhole methods in freshly
    augered and cased wells. Purdue University provided eight additional shear-wave
    profiles from eight sites in their Agricultural Centers; also included is a profile
    from one other site in Vanderburgh County. These data, coupled with the thickness
    of the unconsolidated materials, were used to determine the potential amplification
    of earthquake-induced ground shaking. This report begins the process of defining
    the response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by an earthquake having
    an epicenter within Indiana or nearby states. It is intended to be a tool to enhance
    the performance of the computer program HAZUS, developed by the U.S. Federal Emergency
    Management Agency to model the effects of earthquakes and to assess damage scenarios.
    "Plate 1 of this report, a map of Indiana at a scale of 1:500,000 showing the predicted
    response of geologic materials to seismically induced ground shaking, is intended
    only for regional planning purposes and is not a substitute for on-site shear-wave
    measurements and geotechnical data. Continued field work is anticipated, the results
    of which will enhance the accuracy and value of the map."",nt"license_title":
