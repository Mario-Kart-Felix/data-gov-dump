	"notes": "The aim of this project is the development a large data warehousing and analysis tool for air traffic management (ATM) research that can be accessed by users through intuitive web-based User Interface (UI). DSAT is designed to support requirements of a variety of ATM users, from data handlers interested in maintaining data quality to researchers looking for patterns in acquired data to analysts who need to compute basic metrics on a particular subset of data to managers who need to visualize and report results from a particular analysis. DSAT is a multi-level, multi-objective tool for big data analysis that extracts ATM data from a variety of ATM data stores and prepares it for holistic analysis within an actionable timeline. At this time no turnkey software exists that supports all levels of data handling from storage to reporting for ATM research DSAT serves the purpose of a variety of users through a set of tools customized to handle different types of ATM analysis for different types of users. In particular, DSAT is a (i) data storage tool, (ii) data analysis tool, and (iii) visualization and reporting tool all wrapped into one.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
