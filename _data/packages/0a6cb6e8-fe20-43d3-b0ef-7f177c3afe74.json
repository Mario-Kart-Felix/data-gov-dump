	"notes": "There is a clear and well-identified need for rapid, efficient,nnon-destructive detection and isolation of radiation damaged cells.nAvailable commercial technologies are expensive, require core facilitiesnand use destructive methods. We propose to develop and demonstrate annovel fully automated, microfluidics-based device for identification andnsorting of radiation damaged cells.  The final product will be simple,nsmall, inexpensive and fieldable in research environments as well asnspace. We will identify novel cell surface markers indicating radiationndamage using a microarray (gene expression) experiments and verifyndownselected markers (protein upregulation) using fluorescent antibodyntagged microparticles. CFDRC's proprietary dielectrophoretic cell sorterntechnology will be adapted for automated separation of the taggedndamaged cells from overall population of cells. Proof-of-concept will bendemonstrated by separation of damaged cells from an irradiated cellnsample. Phase II efforts will focus along two primary lines. Surfacenbiomarkers discovery will be further extended and validated. Annintegrated microfluidic cartridge and instrumentation capable of allnoperations (storage, mixing, sorting) will be developed.  The prototypeninstrument will be demonstrated with both terrestrial and spacenradiation (in collaboration with NASA researchers/facilities). Anmulti-disciplinary team consisting of experts in microfluidics engineersn(CFDRC) and radiation biologists (Temple University) has been assembled.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
