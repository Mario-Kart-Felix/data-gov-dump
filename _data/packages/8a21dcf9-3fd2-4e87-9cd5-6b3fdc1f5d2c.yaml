    the following state level layers: Ozone 8-hr (1997 standard), Ozone 8-hr (2008 standard),
    Lead (2008 standard), SO2 1-hr (2010 standard), PM2.5 24hr (2006 standard), PM2.5
    Annual (1997 standard), PM2.5 Annual (2012 standard), and PM10 (1987 standard).
    Included in this package are a file geodatabase and full FGDC metadata records for
    each layer. These layers identify areas in the U.S. where air pollution levels have
    not met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants
    and have been designated "nonattainmentu201d areas (NAA)". The data are updated
    weekly from an OAQPS internal database. However, that does not necessarily mean
    the data have changed. The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS)
    has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which
    are called "criteria" pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, which
    is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe, EPA is required to set
    National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six common air pollutants. These commonly
    found air pollutants (also known as "criteria pollutants") are found all over
    the United States. They are particle pollution (often referred to as particulate
    matter), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and
    lead. For each criteria pollutant, there are specific procedures used for measuring
    ambient concentrations and for calculating long-term (quarterly or annual) and/or
    short-term (24-hour) exposure levels. The methods and allowable concentrations vary
    from one pollutant to another, and within NAAQS revisions for each pollutant. These
    pollutants can harm your health and the environment, and cause property damage.
    Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread
    health threats. EPA calls these pollutants "criteria" air pollutants because it
    regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria
    (science-based guidelines) for setting permissible levels. The set of limits based
    on human health is called primary standards. Another set of limits intended to prevent
    environmental and property damage is called secondary standards. A geographic area
    that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area;
    areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas. In some
    cases, a designated nonattainment area can include portions of 2, 3, or 4 states
    rather than falling entirely within a single state. Multi-state areas have had different
    state portions handled through up to 3 separate EPA regional offices. The actions
    of EPA and the state governments for separate portions of such areas are not always
    simultaneous. While some areas have had coordinated action from all related states
    on the same day, other areas (so-called "split areas") have had delays of several
    months, ranging up to more than 2 years, between different states. EPA must designate
    areas as meeting (attainment) or not meeting (nonattainment) the standard. A designation
    is the term EPA uses to describe the air quality in a given area for any of the
    six common air pollutants (criteria pollutants). After EPA establishes or revises
    a primary and/or secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the Clean
    Air Act requires EPA to designate areas as "attainment" (meeting), "nonattainment"
    (not meeting), or "unclassifiable" (insufficient data) after monitoring data is
    collected by state, local and tribal governments. Once nonattainment designations
    take effect, the state and local governments have three years to develop implementation
    plans outlining how areas will attain and maintain the standards by reducing air
    pollutant emissions. For further information please refer to: http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/greenbk/index.html.
    Questions concerning the status of nonattainment areas, their classification and
    EPA policy should be directed to the appropriate Regional Offices (http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/greenbk/regcntct.html).
    EPA Headquarters should be contacted only when the Regional Office is unable to
    answer a question.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
