		"description": "The geothermal field is bounded on the east by the Neal fault, a major, westdipping,nnorth-northwest-striking, steeply dipping normal to oblique-slip fault, alongnwhich geothermal fluids ascend, and on the west by the concealed north-northweststriking,nwest-dipping Sugarloaf Butte fault. The Neal fault zone can be modeled into twonstructural settings: an interpreted older, left-stepping, normal-slip fault zone and anyounger, oblique sinistral-normal zone, suggested by the earlier west-trending and laternsouthwest-trending extensional stress regimes. Recent sinistral-normal displacement maynhave generated a small pull-apart basin in the Neal area and facilitated development ofnthe geothermal system.

In addition, the geothermal field is 4 km west of the active, north- to northweststriking,nnormal-slip Cottonwood Mountain fault. Furthermore, the field is within severalnkilometers of recently detected seismicity. This, coupled with its active hot springsn(~90u00b0C), opaline sinter mounds, and geothermal fluid flow, suggest that the geothermalnfield lies within an active (Quaternary), southward-terminating, left-stepping fault zone,nwhich locally acts as a pull-apart basin with sinistral- and normal-slip components.",

	"notes": "Detailed geologic mapping (1:24,000 scale), structural and geochemical analyses,nand integration of available geophysical and well-field data were utilized to assess thenstructural controls of the Neal Hot Springs geothermal field in eastern Oregon. Thengeothermal field lies within the intersection of two regional grabens, the middle-latenMiocene, north-trending, Oregon-Idaho graben and younger late Miocene to Holocene,nnorthwest-trending, western Snake River Plain graben. It is marked by Neal Hot Springs,nwhich effuse from opaline sinter mounds just north of Bully Creek. Production andninjection wells, with temperatures up to 142u00b0C, intersect the Neal fault zone at depths ofn680-1900 m and subsidiary faults within a relay ramp or step-over within the fault zone.nThe stratigraphy at Neal correlates with four regional packages. Basement rocks,ndiscovered in one well, are granite, tentatively correlated with Jurassic Olds Ferry-Izeenterrane. Nonconformably above is a thick package of middle Miocene Columbia RivernBasalt Group lavas, regionally known as the basalt of Malheur Gorge. Conformablynabove are middle to late Miocene Oregon-Idaho graben lavas, volcaniclastics, fluvial andnlacustrine rocks. Overlying are the youngest rocks at Neal, which are late Miocene tonPliocene, western Snake River Plain lacustrine, fluvial, and volcaniclastic rocks.nThe structural framework at Neal is characterized by northerly to northweststrikingnnormal faults, including the geothermally related Neal fault zone. Stressninversion of kinematic data reveal an extensional stress regime, including an interpretednyounger, southwest-trending (~243u00b0), least principal stress and an older, west-trendingn(~265u00b0) least principal stress.nThe geothermal field is bounded on the east by the Neal fault, a major, westdipping,nnorth-northwest-striking, steeply dipping normal to oblique-slip fault, alongnwhich geothermal fluids ascend, and on the west by the concealed north-northweststriking,nwest-dipping Sugarloaf Butte fault. The Neal fault zone can be modeled into twonstructural settings: an interpreted older, left-stepping, normal-slip fault zone and anyounger, oblique sinistral-normal zone, suggested by the earlier west-trending and laternsouthwest-trending extensional stress regimes. Recent sinistral-normal displacement maynhave generated a small pull-apart basin in the Neal area and facilitated development ofnthe geothermal system. 'Hard-linkage' between the Neal and Sugarloaf Butte faultsnoccurs through concealed, west-northwest-striking faults, including the CottonwoodnCreek subvertical fault, along which lateral fluid-flow is likely. An inferred northplungingnfault intersection at the Neal Hot Springs likely controls the location of the hotnsprings and sinter terraces.nYoung structural features are evident at Neal. The Neal fault zone cutsnQuaternary fans and late Miocene lower and upper Bully Creek Formation sedimentarynrocks. In addition, the geothermal field is 4 km west of the active, north- to northweststriking,nnormal-slip Cottonwood Mountain fault. Furthermore, the field is within severalnkilometers of recently detected seismicity.
