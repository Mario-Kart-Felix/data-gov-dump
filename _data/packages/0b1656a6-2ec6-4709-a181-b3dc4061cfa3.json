	"notes": "Silicon Carbide deep UV detectors can achieve large gains, high signal-to-noise ratios and solar-blind operation, with added benefits of smaller sizes, lower operating voltages, radiation hardness, ruggedness and scalability. SiC UV APDs implementation is challenging due to some material defects, relatively not-well modeled device operation, and very high absorption coefficients near 200nm wavelengths. The objective of this proposed work is to extend the state-of-the-art in UV sensors by: a) developing SiC deep UV detectors, and b) improving their responsivity down to near 200nm wavelengths. We plan to accomplish this goal by using the SiC UV APD design simulator developed in Phase I, and making further improvements as we introduce new design concepts to improve the responsivity utilizing novel design and fabrication techniques tof the critical n+ top contact layer on the APD to reduce charge recombination in the UV absorption layer.rnrnWe will develop unique fabrication techniques to improve surface quality of the SiC APD structure. This effort will be led by Auburn University, which has developed state-of-the-art fabrication methodologies and capabilities for SiC MOSFETs, in collaboration with CoolCAD who will design the devices and the implantation process.rnrnOur main effort will focus on generating a built-in surface field by creating a steep doping profile right at the surface. Since steep dopant gradients necessary to create a field within 40nm of the surface are not feasible using epitaxial growth techniques for SiC, we will develop implantation and dopant activation sequences, and backend processing techniques to achieve this goal. By creating a field in the deep UV absorption layer (~40nm), we will reduce the initial recombination of electron-hole pairs created by the UV photons and increase current reaching the multiplication region of the APD.",

What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
