	"notes": "Technical staff from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service studied water quality at Union Slough National Wildlife Refuge, Kossuth County, Iowa between 1995 and 1997. This study was conducted because earlier investigations found polluted sediments at the refuge. The study methods included mapping sediment quality, monitoring waters for agricultural pollutants, and confirmation of heavy metal bioaccumulation in bird eggs. The refuge's wetland resources are mostly cattail marsh and open water pools. The water sources for these wetlands are primarily tile drainage effluent. Parts of the refuge had elevated ammonia and selenium concentrations above expected background concentrations. Elevated ammonia concentrations were likely related to the breakdown of large volumes of organic matter loaded to the sediments in the highly productive and eutrophic waters. Sediment selenium enrichment was consistent with previous investigations. The source of the selenium is not known, but could be predominately leached from seleniferous soils in the watershed. Selenium and mercury did bioaccumulate in merganser eggs at slight to moderate hazard levels. Adverse effects to birds from exposure to these heavy metals were predicted, but this needs to be confirmed by additional studies. Insecticide chemicals were not detected by the monitoring plan, but refuge wildlife that foraged at cropfield edges were at risk of insecticide exposure. The monitoring data indicated that herbicide chemicals were transported through the refuge ecosystem. The types of herbicide brands detected at the refuge followed chemical use patterns in the watershed. The concentrations of herbicide chemicals detected in refuge surface water were below lethal benchmark values for aquatic life. However, the concentrations of herbicide chemicals detected in surface water were above levels that may stress aquatic plants. The monitoring data also indicated nutrient (ammonia, nitrate and phosphate) rich tile drainage water and pool surface water. Blooms of aquatic nuisance plants and fish kills were observed during the study period. We suggest that the loading of nutrients was sufficient to cause changes to the structure and composition of refuge plant communities and cultural eutrophication of refuge surface water resources. The altered ecological communities in the polluted areas function to treat nitrogen inputs, providing less diverse wildlife habitats and food resources. Several wetland and watershed management strategies are discussed to help managers increase habitat diversity and benefits to migratory birds. Refuge operation specialists have implemented several watershed initiatives to date. We should not become discouraged or impatient for success because it is important to note that an increment of improvement in the watershed will not necessarily result in an increment of improvement in refuge water quality. It is possible that little or no ecological change may occur or be observed at the refuge in our lifetime until a critical level is reached in the watershed resulting in a noticeable shift in refuge environmental habitat quality in the future.",
