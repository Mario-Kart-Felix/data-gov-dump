	"notes": "Pursuant to an agreement reached between the Assistant Regional Director, Refuges and Wildlife, Region 6, Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Director, National Ecology Research Center, Fish and Wildlife Service, a Biological Survey of the Vertebrates of Fort Niobrara and Valentine National Wildlife Refuges was conducted. Field work commenced April 1991 and concluded September 1992. This is the Final Report on this work. The objectives of the study were to: (1) summarize vegetation and landscape alterations occurring since about 1850; (2) determine what vertebrates historically inhabited the areas of the refuges; (3) conduct biological surveys to confirm current presence or absence of vertebrates, excluding fishes; and ( 4) identify changes that may have caused extirpation or invasion of species and provide management recommendations. At the request of Region 6, the bird portion of the study was expanded in the second year to allocate more effort to species composition, habitat relationships, and timing of migration of birds, especially Neotropical migrants. The Final Report includes an Introduction, followed by five chapters that discuss fauna! and floral change in the Sandhills since 1850; historical distribution of fishes; and historical distribution, fauna! changes, and current status of amphibians and reptiles, birds, and mammals. A summary of management concerns and suggestions for further study concludes the report. The vertebrate groups differ considerably in relative ease of observation, in the completeness of each group's historical record, relative importance to early explorers and naturalists, and extent and refinement of current scientific knowledge. These differences are clearly reflected in the individual chapters, with certain kinds of information differing from group to group. In general, amphibians are most poorly known and difficult to study, birds are somewhat better known historically and quite well understood in terms of present-day distribution and abundance, and mammals tend to be well known in an historic sense yet more like the herpetofauna in terms of our modem-day understanding. We found no crises requiring immediate attention or change. Our recommendations are suggestions for further study and thus serve to identify potential long-term problems that can be influenced with the acquisition of new data and development of new management plans. We suggest specific ideas for studies of upland Sandhills, wet meadows, ponds and lakes, and woody habitats to elucidate how they can be maintained, enhanced, or managed to help preserve biological diversity. Some of our habitat concerns suggest opportunities for experimental studies of the use of grazing as a management tool in the Sandhills. Aquatic habitats are being well managed for turtles, which need to be protected from commercial collectors, but are not so well managed for amphibians.",
