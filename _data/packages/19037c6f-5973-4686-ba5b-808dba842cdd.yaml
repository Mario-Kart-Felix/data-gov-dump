  mosaic generated from a collection of natural color and false color infrared orthophotos
  covering the island of Puerto Rico collected for the United States Army Corps of
  Engineers. The mosaic was created from 16 individual image tiles (i.e., tile numbers
  17066-H2_01, 17066-H2_02, 17066-H2_03, 17066-H2_05,17066-H2_06,17066-H2_07, 17066-H2_09,
  17066-H2_10, 17066-H2_11, 17066-H3_02, 17066-H3_03, 17066-H3_04, 17066-H3_06, 17066-H3_07,
  17066-H3_08, 17066-H3_12) using ENVI 4.7's Georeferenced Mosaicking function. An
  orthophoto is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the
  image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed.
  Orthophotography combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric
  qualities of a map. The source imagery was obtained from November 2006 through March
  2007 and used to produce orthophotos with a one foot ground sample distance (GSD).
  Imagery was acquired at 0.9 foot GSD resolution. Flight height maintained during
  mission was 8,650 feet AGL. The imagery was captured at 12-bit radiometric resolution
  and converted to 8-bit radiometric resolution during post processing. The imagery
  was captured with 30% sidelap between all adjacent flight lines. The PRVI project
  area was divided into 20 flight blocks due to neccessary base station and flight
  line length requirements. The imagery was obtained and processed by all digital
  means beginning with data acquisition using an ADS40 digital sensor. The orthophotos
  are also available in GeoTIFF form from the distributor.\",\n\t\"owner_org\": \"e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819\",\n\t\"extras\":
