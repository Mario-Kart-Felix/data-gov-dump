    was contracted by the Western Riverside County Regional Conservation Authority to
    perform an update to their original 2005 Western Riverside Vegetation Map. The project
    was funded through a Local Assistance Grant from the California Department of Fish
    and Wildlife (CDFW). The original vegetation layer was created in 2005 using a baseline
    image dataset created from 2000/01 Emerge imagery flown in early spring. The original
    map has been used to monitor and evaluate the habitat in the Western Riverside County
    Multi-species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP). An update to the original map was
    needed to address changes in vegetation makeup that have occurred in the intervening
    years due to widespread and multiple burns in the mapping area, urban expansion,
    and broadly occurring vegetation succession.The update conforms to the standards
    set by the National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS) published in 2008 by
    the Federal Geographic Data Committee. (FGDC-STD-005-2008, Vegetation Subcommittee,
    Federal Geographic Data Committee, February 2008) The update also adheres to the
    vegetation types as represented in the 2008-second edition of the Manual of California
    Vegetation (MCV2). Extensive ground based field data both within and nearby the
    western Riverside County mapping area has been acquired since the completion of
    the project in 2005. This additional data has resulted in the reclassification of
    several vegetation types that are addressed in the updated vegetation map. The mapping
    area covers 1,017,364 acres of the original 1.2 million acres mapped in the 2005
    study. The new study covers portions of the Upper Santa Ana River Valley, Perris
    Plain, and the foothills of the San Jacinto and Santa Ana Mountains but excludes
    US Forest Service land. The final geodatabase includes an updated 2012 vegetation
    map. Vegetative and cartographic comparisons between the newly created 2012 image-based
    map and the original vegetation map produced in 2005 are described in this report.The
    Update mapping was performed using baseline digital imagery created in 2012 by the
    US Department of Agriculture u2013 Farm Service Agencyu2019s National Agricultural
    Imagery Program (NAIP). Vegetation units were mapped using the National Vegetation
    Classification System (NVCS) to the Alliance and Association level as depicted in
    the MCV2. Approximately 55% of the study area is classified to vegetated or naturally
    occurring sparsely vegetated types; the remaining 45% is unvegetated, with over
    a third (36%) in urban development and an additional 9% in agriculture. The major
    tasks for the Update project consisted of updating the original mapping classification
    to conform to the changes and refinements to the MCV2 classification, updating the
    existing vegetation map to 2012 conditions, retroactively correcting the 2005 vegetation
    interpretations, creating the final report and project metadata, and producing the
    final vegetation geodatabase. After completion of the original 2005 vegetation map,
    CDFW crosswalked the original mapping units to the NVCS hierarchical names as defined
    in the Manual of California Vegetation (MCV).The original crosswalk was revised
    during the Update effort to reflect changes in the original MCV classification as
    depicted in the second edition (MCV2). Changes were minor and did not result in
    a significant effort in the updating process. The updating process in many steps
    is similar to the creation of the original vegetation map. First, photo interpreters
    review the study area for terrain, environmental features, and probable vegetation
    types present. Questionable photo signatures on the new baseline imagery (2012 NAIP)
    were compared to the original 2000/01 Emerge imagery. Photo signatures for a given
    vegetation polygon were correlated between the two image datasets. Production level
    updates to the linework and labeling commenced following the correlation of the
    two baseline image datasets and the subsequent refinement of photo interpretation
    criteria and biogeographical descriptions of the types. Existing datasets depicting
    topography, fire history, climate and past vegetation gathering efforts aided photo
    interpreters in their delineations and floristic assignments during the updating
    effort. The production updating effort took approximately 11 months.",nt"owner_org":
