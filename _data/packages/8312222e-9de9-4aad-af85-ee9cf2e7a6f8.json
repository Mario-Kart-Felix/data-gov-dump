	"notes": "Thermal anemometry (a.k.a. hot-wire anemometry) has been a key experimental technique in fluid mechanics for many decades. Due to the small physical size and high frequency response of the sensors (resulting in excellent spatial and temporal resolution), the technique has been widely used for studies of turbulent flows. Even with the advent of nonintrusive techniques such as Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), hot wire anemometry is uniquely capable of extremely high frequency response and fine spatial resolution measurements.rnrnViGYAN proposes a fundamental change to the anemometer configuration, with two related aspects. First, the circuitry to power the sensor and establish its operating point is packaged immediately adjacent to the sensor, i.e. in the typical probe holder, removing the effect of the cable connecting the sensor to an external anemometer. Second, modern analog-digital conversion hardware will be employed to the maximum extent possible, potentially including directly driving the sensor. Data transmission will then be fully digital, immune to environmental variations or electrical noise. Further, direct excitation would permit the choice of operating modes (not just variation of operating point) by changes in software. The ultimate objective of the research is therefore referred to as a "Digital Bridge".",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
