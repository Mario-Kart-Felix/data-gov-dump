	"notes": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY-Ouray National Wildlife Refuge (ONWR) and Ouray National Fish Hatchery (ONFH) share many attributes. Hatchery facilities are within the boundaries of the ONWR, the two facilities share geographical and climatic settings, and water resources are common between facilities. Throughout this Water Resources Inventory and Assessment (WRIA) many abiotic and sociopolitical influences pertain to both facilities (ONWR and ONFH), such that much information can be summarized collectively.Management of ONWR is focused on maintaining a variety of native habitats and wildlife with emphasis on migratory birds, threatened and endangered species, and species of special concern. Due to land development along the Green River for urban, industrial, and agricultural uses, native habitat for many wildlife species is dwindling. The ONWR is pursuing restoration of natural ecological functions to strengthen healthy habitat. These ecological functions include hydrological processes related to seasonally flooded wetlands, and restoration of the riparian corridor. The Green River is pivotal in these management practices. Green River hydrology will dictate the potential for management and restoration. The Green River and its floodplain are designated critical habitat for four endangered fish species of the Upper Colorado River System. ONWRu2019s flooded bottomlands provide a sanctuary of protected fish habitat that may be a critical link to establishing self-sustaining populations of these endangered fish.  In a collaborative effort between three USFWS programs: Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program, Colorado River Fish Project, and ONWR, Region 6 was awarded funding  in 2014 under the Cooperative recovery Initiative to provide suitable nursery habitat to support wild recruitment of the endangered razorback sucker. This project was completed in May 2015. Working with the Bureau of Reclamation for the construction, this project reshaped wetland connections to the Green River and added a slotted pipe to the inlet to prevent colonization by adult non-native fish. ONFH is instrumental in providing Razorback Sucker to this program. Modification of ONWR protective dikes to benefit endangered fish and cottonwood regeneration has involved dike removal in Wyasket, Johnson Bottom, Woods Bottom, and Leota Bottom wetland units.  Dike removal allows restoration of backwater flood dynamics in floodplain wetlands. A dike in Sheppard Bottom was breached for selenium remediation. Additional dike removal is being evaluated by Refuge management in cooperation with the USFWS Region 6, Division of Water Resources (FWS-WTR) and USFWS Region 6, Division of Biological Resources (Inventory & Monitoring). A briefing paper on survey work and recommendations for restoration of Sheppard Bottom, and associated roadway protection, is included as Appendix B.ONFH is located on the ONWR. ONFH was established as a fish refugia and technology development facility, to assist in the recovery of razorback sucker, Colorado Pikeminnow, Bonytail, and humpback chub. ONFH is a proud partner of the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program. Partners in this program include State agencies, Bureau of Reclamation, National Park Service, Utah Water Users Association, and The Nature Conservancy. These partners are working together to recover these endangered fish and to promote a healthy river system.ONFH daily operations rely on water pumped from a series of shallow ground water wells adjacent to the Green River, designed to withstand periodic flooding. Water from this u201cwet well-fieldu201d has high concentrations of iron and manganese, and requires treatment to be acceptable for hatchery use. The current water treatment facility is effective at providing high quality water to the hatchery, but represents a resource commitment: a substantial portion of annual operations costs are focused on water treatment.",
