	"notes": "An indoor environment for simulating airspace operations will bendesigned. Highly maneuverable subscale vehicles can be used to simulatenthe dynamics of full-scale vehicles by applying software limiters onntheir rates. Multiple vehicles can operate autonomously or can bencoordinated through centralized control. The effects of weather onnsystem throughput can be assessed by monitoring movements in thencontrolled environment, Faults related to communication, detection andnvehicle performance can be inserted into the system, to assess thenrobustness of proposed airspace concepts.   We are particularlyninterested in the impact of UAVs in the NAS. Automated separationnassurance schemes are essential for UAV integration. The indoornenvironment is ideally suited to prove out both airborne andnground-based approaches to separation assurance. Beyond this particularnmotivation for developing this test facility, evaluation of novelnalgorithms for trajectory design and innovative communication conceptsncan be assessed safely and cost-effectively in this environment. The keyninnovation is the environment in which vehicles and airspacentechnologies can be assessed. We are not proposing innovation in thentechnologies themselves. Furthermore, we think that the key elements ofnthe environment are already available, but they have not been assembledninto a system that supports airspace simulation. The innovation isnprimarily system integration, with some customization of the variousnelements so that interaction between elements is representative ofnfull-scale airspace operations.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
