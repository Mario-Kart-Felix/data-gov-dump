		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

	"notes": "&lt;p&gt;The space suit is arguably the most intimate piece of space flight hardware yet we know surprisingly little about the interactions between the astronaut and this machine.&amp;nbsp; Current EVA mobility studies only allow for comparisons of how the suit moves when actuated by a human and how the human moves when unsuited. Over decades, engineering and science teams have attempted to bridge this gap using tools from live x-rays to shape tape to pressure sensors but none of these technologies have proved to be both safe and reliable. However, there are now new wireless inertial measurement units (IMUs) that are small enough to be worn in pockets of the space suit undergarments to provide real-time data on the postures and joint angles assumed by the suited test subject as they conduct simulated EVA tasks.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Thus the proposed development is to use the new IMUs with the data collection system that can synch across 32 human worn sensors and simultaneously link to the Vicon MX data collected from externally mounted suit reflectors.&amp;nbsp; Initially, success of this project will be measured by the ability to transmit the wireless signals through the pressurized suit without significant loss of signal or distortion and the development of software code to accurately describe the motion of joint segments during simulated EVA tasks.&amp;nbsp; Follow on efforts will provide the first time linked data sets for internal and external movements during suited mobility assessments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
