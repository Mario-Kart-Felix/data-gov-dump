	"notes": "&lt;p&gt;Recent findings indicate that frequent, short-term crew exposure to elevated CO2 levels combined with other physiological impacts of microgravity may lead to a number of detrimental effects, including loss of vision. To evaluate the risks associated with transient elevated CO2 levels and design effective countermeasures, doctors must have access to frequent CO2 measurements in the immediate vicinity of individual crew members along with simultaneous measurements of their location in the space environment.&amp;nbsp; To achieve this goal, a small, low-power, wearable system that integrates an accurate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sensor with an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio capable of real-time location estimation and data communication is proposed.&amp;nbsp; This system would be worn by crew members and would automatically gather and transmit&amp;nbsp; sampled sensor data tagged with real-time, high-resolution location information.&amp;nbsp; Under the current proposed effort, a breadboard prototype of such a system will be developed.&amp;nbsp; Although the initial effort is targeted to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monitoring, the concept is applicable to other types of sensors.&amp;nbsp; For the initial effort, existing EV Modular Instrumentation System (MIS) Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) hardware will be leveraged to integrate a low-power CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sensor with a commercially available UWB radio system with ranging capability.&amp;nbsp; In addition, potential for integration of this system with EV&amp;rsquo;s Electronic-textile System for the Evaluation of Wearable Technology (E-SEWT) will be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
