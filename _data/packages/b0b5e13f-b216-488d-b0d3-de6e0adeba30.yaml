    of selected nation based and state based geographic and cartographic information
    from then                    U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File/Topologically
    Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) database. The geodatabasesn
                       include feature class layers of information for the fifty states,
    the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island areas (American Samoa, the
    n                    Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the
    United States Virgin Islands). The geodatabases do not contain any sensitive data.
    The n                    2015 TIGER Geodatabases are designed for use with Esriu00e2u0080u0099s
    ArcGIS. n                n                    The 2015 State Geodatabase for Wyoming
    contains multiple layers. These layers are the Block, Block Group, Census Designated
    Place, Census Tract,n                    County Subdivision and Incorporated Place
    layers.n                                       n                    Block Groups
    (BGs) are clusters of blocks within the same census tract. Each census tract contains
    at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numberedn                    within census
    tracts.  BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs have the same first digit
    of their 4-digit census block number from the samen                    decennial
    census.  For example, tabulation blocks numbered 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within
    census tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within thatn                    census
    tract.  BGs coded 0 are intended to only include water area, no land area, and they
    are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, andn                    Great
    Lakes water areas. Block groups generally contain  between 600 and 3,000 people.
     A BG usually covers a contiguous area but never crossesn                    county
    or census tract boundaries. They may, however, cross the boundaries of other geographic
    entities like county subdivisions, places, urbann                    areas, voting
    districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native
    Hawaiian areas.  The BG boundaries in this releasen                    are those
    that were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas
    Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.  n                    n                    The
    primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units
    for the presentation of census data and comparison back ton                    previous
    decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200
    and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.n                    When
    first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to
    population characteristics, economic status, and livingn                    conditions.
     The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.
     Physical changes in street patterns caused byn                    highway construction,
    new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census
    tracts occasionally are split due ton                    population growth, or combined
    as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally
    follow visible and identifiablen                    features.  They may follow legal
    boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in
    some States and situations ton                    allow for census tract-to-governmental
    unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between
    censuses.  State andn                    county boundaries always are census tract
    boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances,
    a census tract mayn                    consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous
    areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal
    entitiesn                    that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census,
    the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts
    thatn                    include a majority American Indian population according
    to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized
    Americann                    Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands;
    the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained
    littlen                    or no population and represented a relatively large special
    land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrialn
                       park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for
    those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.  n                    n
                       An incorporated place is established to provide governmental
    functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD),n
                       which generally is created to provide services or administer
    an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a
    state,n                    but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.
     An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can haven
                       other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial
    census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineatedn
                       to provide data for settled concentrations of population that
    are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the
    staten                    in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often
    are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually
    coinciden                    with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent
    incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one
    decennialn                    census to the next with changes in the settlement
    pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not
    necessarilyn                    have the same boundary.  The only population/housing
    size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.
     n                    n                    The boundaries of most incorporated
    places in this shapefile are as of January 1, 2013, as reported through the Census
    Bureau's Boundary andn                    Annexation Survey (BAS).  Limited updates
    that occurred after January 1, 2013, such as newly incorporated places, are also
    included.  The boundariesn                    of all CDPs were delineated as part
    of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010
    Census.n                    n                    The primary legal divisions of
    most states are termed counties.  In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes.
     In Alaska, which has non                    counties, the equivalent entities
    are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized
    area, census areas.  Then                    latter are delineated cooperatively
    for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.  In four
    states (Maryland, Missouri,n                    Nevada, and Virginia), there are
    one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization
    and thus constitute primaryn                    divisions of their states.  These
    incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent
    entities for purposes of datan                    presentation.  The District of
    Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent
    entity for purposes of datan                    presentation.  The Census Bureau
    treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation:
    Municipios in Puerton                    Rico, Districts and Islands in American
    Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands
    in the U.S. Virginn                    Islands.  The entire area of the United States,
    Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.
     The boundaries forn                    counties and equivalent entities are mostly
    as of January 1, 2013, primarily as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary
    andn                    Annexation Survey (BAS).  However, some changes made after
    January 2013, including the addition and deletion of counties, are included.n                    n
                       County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and
    their equivalent entities for the reporting of Census Bureau data. They includen
                       legally-recognized minor civil divisions (MCDs) and statistical
    census county divisions (CCDs), and unorganized territories.  For the 2010 Census,n
                       the MCDs are the primary governmental and/or administrative
    divisions of counties in 29 States and Puerto Rico; Tennessee changed from having
    CCDsn                    for Census 2000 to having MCDs for the 2010 Census.  In
    MCD States where no MCD exists or is not defined, the Census Bureau creates statisticaln
                       unorganized territories to complete coverage.  The entire area
    of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas are covered by countyn                    subdivisions.
     The boundaries of most legal MCDs are as of January 1, 2013, as reported through
    the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Surveyn                    (BAS). The
    boundaries of all CCDs, delineated in 21 states, are those as reported as part of
    the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areasn                    Program (PSAP)
