	"notes": "Mars Aqueous Processing System (MAPS) is an innovative method to produce useful building materials from Martian regolith. Acids and bases produced from the regolith are used to aid the preparation of metals (such as iron) and cement ingredients (such as lime and aggregate) for construction of habitats and infrastructure needed for early human colonization.  As more regolith is processed, more acids and bases will be produced for use in manufacture of plastics, metals, polymers, and reagents useful for later, larger-scale human habitation. With the apparent abundance of water in certain locations on Mars, the proposed technology will enable the manufacture and fabrication of a variety of materials using only Mars indigenous materials with the use of processing equipment and catalysts brought from Earth.rnrnThe proposed processing methods are capable of extracting and separating regolith constituents via aqueous extraction followed by selective precipitation based on solution pH and oxidation potential. Thermal treatments such as drying (to remove moisture), roasting (to remove volatile sulfate and chloride acid precursors), and oxide reduction (using hydrogen, carbon monoxide, or carbon derived from Martian water and atmosphere) are integrated with the aqueous extraction methods to manufacture the basic building materials required to facilitate human habitation.rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
