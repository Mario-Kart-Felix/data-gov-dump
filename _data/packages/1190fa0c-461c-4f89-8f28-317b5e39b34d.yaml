    & Ranging) 5x5 meter resolution relative seafloor reflectivity surface for an area
    surrounding the mouth of Salt River Bay (SARI), St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands
    (USVI). The image's horizontal coordinate system is NAD83 UTM 20 North. Fugro LADS,
    in collaboration with NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, the University
    of New Hampshire and the National Park Service, acquired bathymetry, relative seafloor
    reflectivity and hyperspectral imagery in St. Croix from 2/21 to 2/22/2011. Hyperspectral
    data were acquired using a Hyspex VNIR-1600 sensor. Bathymetry and reflectivity
    data were acquired using a LADS (Laser Airborne Depth Sounder) Mark II Airborne
    System from altitudes between 1,200 and 2,200ft at ground speeds between 140 and
    175 knots. The 900 Hertz Nd: YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet) laser
    (1064 nm) acquired 5x5 meter spot spacing and 200% seabed coverage. In total, 1.62
    square kilometers of LiDAR relectivity were collected between 0 m and 34 m in depth.
    Environmental factors such as wind strength and direction, cloud cover, water clarity
    and depth influenced the area of data acquisition on a daily basis. The data was
    processed using the LADS Mark II Ground System and data visualization, quality control
    and final products were created using CARIS HIPS and SIPS and CARIS BASE Editor.
    All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to
    their own needs and standards.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
