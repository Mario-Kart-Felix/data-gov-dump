	"notes": "&lt;p&gt;Armstrong researchers have developed a portable data acquisition system (PDAT) that can be easily transported and set up at remote locations to display and archive data in real time. The PDAT was developed to collect data from strain gages and fiber optic sensors installed on a revolutionary wing flap while it was being constructed by NASA partner FlexSys, Inc. in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as part of the Adaptive Compliant Trailing Edge (ACTE) project. The PDAT enabled the Armstrong team to monitor and analyze data collected during the construction process and provide vital feedback to designers onsite at FlexSys instead of having to wait until construction was completed and shipped to Armstrong&amp;rsquo;s facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work to date&lt;/strong&gt;: This unique and flexible system has 64 channels for analog data, 32 channels for thermocouples, and utilizes Ethernet technology to capture&amp;nbsp;6,000 parameters of fiber optic data. It is currently configured to gather strain gage and thermocouple inputs, but a variety of other hardware can be installed, including cards for pressure transducers, voltages, currents, motion paks, accelerometers, MIL-STD-1553 and ARINC 429 aircraft data buses, and Ethernet packets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/strong&gt;: The PDAT has been an integral part of the ACTE project, and the team believes the technology is versatile enough to become a successful component of many current and future Armstrong projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convenient&lt;/strong&gt;: This innovation enables real-time analysis of data collected at remote locations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portable&lt;/strong&gt;: The hardware is easily removable, attaches to a single heat sink pallet, and fits into a single small case for quick transport. It can be used in a variety of locations (laboratory, hangar, and flight line).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible&lt;/strong&gt;: The technology can be quickly reprogrammed to support various tests and can display and archive data from virtual streams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economical&lt;/strong&gt;: The system reduces manufacturing and testing costs associated with multiple data collection and analysis sites.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collects sensor, voltage, current, pressure, aircraft avionics, and Ethernet data&lt;/p&gt;",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
