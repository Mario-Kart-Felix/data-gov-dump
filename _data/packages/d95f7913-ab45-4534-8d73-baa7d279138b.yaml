    to support the marine transportation infrastructure and coastal management for a
    number of years. The NOAA ENC will support all types of marine navigation by providing
    the official database for electronic charting systems (ECS), including the Electronic
    Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS). NOAA ENCs support real-time navigation
    as well as collision and grounding avoidance needs of the mariner, and accommodate
    a real-time tide and current display capability that is essential for large vessel
    navigation. NOAA ENCs will also provide fully integrated vector base maps for use
    in geographic information systems (GIS) that are used for coastal management or
    other purposes. The NOAA ENCs are in the International Hydrographic Office (IHO)

    may be downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
    are official products. Official ENCs are suitable for navigation under the following
    regulations and policies, and in the following circumstances:On May 2, 2001, the
    United States Coast Guard amended the chart carriage regulations to permit government
    vessels to use electronic charting and navigation systems in lieu of paper charts.On
    August 15, 2002, the United States Coast Guard issued a statement of policy to bring
    its regulations into agreement with SOLAS Chapter V (as amended by the changes taking
    effect July 1, 2002). The policy statement said that, if a ship has an approved
    ECDIS installed according to SOLAS, Chapter V, the ECDIS will be considered as meeting
    the ship's nautical chart carriage regulations. The ships that are affected are:U.S.-flagged
    ships of 150 or more gross tons that engage on international voyages.U.S.-flagged
    ships certificated solely for service on the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.Foreign-flag
    ships to which SOLAS, Chapter V, applies that are operating on the navigable waters
    of the United States.This policy is not applicable to U.S.-flag ships engaged only
    on domestic voyages. These ships must continue to comply with existing navigation
    equipment requirements until the chart carriage regulations are formally amended.The
    NOAA ENC files available from this site are updated for Notices to Mariners on at
    least a monthly basis. Users are encouraged to check the site frequently and download
    the latest versions of the files. Notice to mariner updates are either contained
    in a new edition ENC or an incremental update (also called ENC Revision or "ER"
    files).Copying, reproduction of the NOAA ENCs to any other server or location for
    further reproduction or redistribution is discouraged unless the following guidelines
    are followed: 1) the NOAA ENCs and supplementary files including the CATALOG.031
    and README.TXT are included in their entirety, 2) this disclaimer is displayed to
    and accepted by anyone who accesses the NOAA ENCs, and 3) a reference to this Web
    site is included so that anyone accessing the NOAA ENCs is advised of where they
    originated. If these NOAA ENCs are incorporated into any other product in a form
    other than as provided by NOAA, the producer of that product assumes full liability
    and must adhere to conditions 2 and 3 described in the paragraph above concerning
    copying or reproduction. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
    have promulgated certification requirements with standards for applicants who want
    to redistribute NOAA Electronic Navigational Charts (NOAA ENCs) as official data.
    Two types of certification are offered. The first type, "Certified NOAA ENC Distributor"
    (CED), covers NOAA ENC downloading, exact copying, and redistribution of those copies.
    The second type, "Certified NOAA ENC Value Added Distributor" (CEVAD), permits
    reformatting official NOAA ENCs into a System Electronic Navigational Chart (SENC)
    using type-approved software, and distribution of that SENC. NOAA intends by this
    action to assure that, though redistributed, quality official NOAA ENC data is offered
    to the public in support of safe navigation on U.S. waters. This rule can be found
    in the 15 CFR Part 995. A list of approved certified distributors can be found at
