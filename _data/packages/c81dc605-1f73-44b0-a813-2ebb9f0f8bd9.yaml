    consideration by approaching NASA's goals for N+2 and N+3 energy consumption, noise,
    emission and field length, conceptual design tools to expedite the design cycle
    are desired. During this Phase I effort ESAero will progress the development of
    the hybrid-electric distributed propulsion (HEDP) TOGW tool developed in the previous
    Phase I SBIR (NNX13CC24P) by producing a physics-based wing structure analysis and
    weight estimation module. The layout of the structural members will be estimated
    using heuristic trends and top-level design assumptions, and the members will be
    sized according to classical beam theory. The interaction between HEDP configuration
    and aircraft weight is important to understand, as one primary advantage of the
    configuration is the ability to place smaller propulsors at virtually any location
    on the aircraft, leveraging pre-existing airframe supports. By delving into the
    structural analysis of HEDP designs, progress can be made toward determining how
    sensitive aircraft structural weight is to propulsion configuration. This new module
    will replace the modified, empirically based equations used in the current TOGW
    framework. By incorporating this capability, the novel architectures and configurations
    of HEDP systems, as well as other advanced aircraft concepts, could be analyzed
    and sized with greater fidelity. Furthermore, this effort may start to unravel concerns
    over other structural members paving the way for further investigation in a Phase
    II. Other potential Phase II tasks may include integrating this structural analysis
    and weight estimation into other conceptual design tools, such as OpenVSP.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
