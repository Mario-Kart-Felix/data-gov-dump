    for all mesophotic corals in the Au'au Channel region. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt)
    modeling software was used to create this ensemble model, which is an average of
    10 model replicates. MaxEnt works by analyzing the distribution of environmental
    variables where species are present, so it can find other areas that meet all of
    the same environmental constraints. Georeferenced records containing information
    about mesophotic coral occurrence and environmental predictors describing the seafloor_s
    depth, vertical structure, available light, surface temperature, currents and distance
    from shoreline were used to train MaxEnt. Model performance and accuracy were assessed
    using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) and a randomly
    chosen, spatially independent data subset. The average test AUC for this predictive
    ensemble model was 0.9, and the overall accuracy of this ensemble predictive model
    was 73.1% (when the habitat suitability threshold = 0.25). The habitat suitability
    threshold of 0.25 represents the sum of the maximum ROC sensitivity and specificity
    values. Extreme care should be taken when selecting a habitat suitability threshold
    because it affects the probability of correctly identifying the presence and absence
    of mesophotic corals. For more information describing how this predictive surface
    was developed and its limitations, please see the following website: https://coastalscience.noaa.gov/projects/detail?key=48",nt"owner_org":
