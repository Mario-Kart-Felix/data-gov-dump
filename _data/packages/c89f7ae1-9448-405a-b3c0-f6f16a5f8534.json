	"notes": "Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) proposes the design and validation ofna dynamic integrated arrival/departure  scheduler. In contrast toncurrent approaches, we propose changing arrival and departure runwaynassignments dynamically based upon the traffic situation, weathernconditions, surface congestion, and planned departure pushbacks as wellnas planned arrivals flowing into the terminal area from the enroutencenters. Testing of the concept will be done in a virtual softwarenenvironment, first using an analytic environment and later withnhumans-in-the-loop (controllers and pilots). When complete, this projectnhas the potential to provide (1) a strategy to handle the FAA'snBest-Equipped Best-Served concept at airports, (2) a significantnincrease in Metroplex capacity without building additional runways andn(3) support for a new aviation business model in which flights arenscheduled to Metroplexes rather than specific airports.  To accomplishnthese goals, this effort will develop a controller that dynamicallynassigns arrival and departure slots available at a given runway based onnthe valuation of an &amp;quot;integrated capacity utilization metric.&amp;quot;nThe metric will be a function of arrival/departure demand, arrival queuenlengths at fixes and surface departure queues. The result is a morenefficient use of airport resources than provided by currently available controllers.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
