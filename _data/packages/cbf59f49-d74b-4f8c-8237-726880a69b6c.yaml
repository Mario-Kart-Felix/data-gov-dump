  has become one of the most fascinating bodies in the Solar System. Titan is the
  richest laboratory in the solar system for studying prebiotic chemistry, which makes
  studying its chemistry from the surface and in the atmosphere one of the most important
  objectives in planetary science. The diversity of surface features on Titan related
  to organic solids and liquids makes long-range mobility with surface access important.
  This has not been possible, because mission concepts to date have had either no
  mobility (landers), no surface access (balloons and airplanes), or low maturity,
  high risk, and/or high development costs for this environment (e,g. large, self-sufficient,
  long-duration helicopters).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose a mission study of a small
  (&amp;lt; 10 kg) rotorcraft that can deploy from a balloon or lander to acquire
  close-up, high resolution imagery and mapping data of the surface, land at multiple
  locations to acquire microscopic imagery and samples of solid and liquid material,
  return the samples to the mothership for analysis, and recharge from an RTG on the
  mothership to enable multiple sorties. Prior studies have shown the feasibility
  of aerial mobility on Titan for larger aircraft, from 10 to 400 kg, but none of
  these studies were in the size range we address and none addressed the daughtercraft,
  sampling, and recharging scenarios we address. This concept is enabled now by recent
  advances in autonomous navigation and miniaturization of sensors, processors, and
  sampling devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It revolutionizes previous mission concepts
  in several ways. For a lander mission, it enables detailed studies of a large area
  around the lander, providing context for the micro-images and samples; with precision
  landing near a lake, it potentially enables sampling solid and liquid material from
  one lander. For a balloon mission, it enables surface investigation and sampling
  with global reach without requiring a separate lander or that the balloon be brought
  to the surface, which has potential for major cost savings and risk reduction. Both
  scenarios can involve repeated sorties due to the recharge capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our
  phase 1 study activities will (1) develop mission concepts of operations for deployment
  from a lander or balloon to acquire context imaging and mapping data, to sample
  from solid surfaces and/or lakes, and to return to the mothership to deposit samples
  and/or recharge; (2) develop a parametric sizing model of the daughtercraft to characterize
  propulsion, power, range, endurance, and payload capability for total daughtercraft
  mass ranging from approximately 1 to 10 kg; (3) develop a conceptual design and
  identify representative components the entire daughtercraft hardware and software
  system for autonomous mobility, including estimates of approximate mass, power,
  and energy budgets and producing a representative CAD model; and (4) develop a conceptual
  design and preliminary CAD model for a science payload on the daughtercraft, including
  specifying a nominal instrument suite on the balloon or lander, designing a compatible
  sampling mechanism to acquire solid and/or liquid samples on the daughtercraft,
  and studying mechanisms and daughtercraft behaviors necessary to transfer the samples
  to the instruments. The study will be done by JPL with support from AeroVironment
  for rotorcraft expertise and developing the sizing model. By analyzing Titan&amp;#39;s
  surface, this mission concept may teach us volumes about prebiotic chemical evolution
  on a planetary surface.&lt;/p&gt;\",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S. Government Work\",\n\t\"extras\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
