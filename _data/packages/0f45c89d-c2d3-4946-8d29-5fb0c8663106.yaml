    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "The utility of stereoscopic 3D image representation
    in many applications is now well established.  It is not just a matter of stereo
    being better than 2D, but of stereo being necessary to interpret representations
    of complex data sets, physical phenomena, engineering designs and position in space.
     The US Air Force has long recognized the potential for 3D displays in the cockpit
    but until now the limitations of 3D display technology have prevented implementation.
     Interest in 3D image display has recently surfaced among SPAWAR and among agencies
    who use helicopters and firms that make camera systems for helicopters for use in
    power line inspection, law enforcement, and military applications. There is also
    interest in the use of plane mounted cameras in collision avoidance while taxiing
    on runways, where 3D display may be of benefit because it can show the pilot how
    much room there is between the plane and obstacles. 3D displays for these applications
    must be of the glasses free type, but current embodiments of such displays possess
    extremely low resolution, produce visual artifacts, and tend to produce very narrow
    viewing areas.  Under a recent DOE SBIR Phase II contract DTI developed a new glasses
    free 2D/3D switchable display that avoids the resolution loss, visual artifacts,
    and viewing restrictions associated with all other autostereoscopic displays, providing
    full HD resolution in 3D as well as in a 2D viewing mode.  DTI's believes that this
    new technology can lead to the first practical implementation of a 3D display in
    the cockpit. During this Phase I program DTI will investigate the adaptation of
    its 2D/3D displays to cockpit displays through compact design, ruggedizing, and
    the development of mechanical, electronic, computer, and software interfaces to
    an aircraft system.  This investigation will lead to a high level design and specification
    for a prototype display that can developed in Phase II and delivered for testing
    in a cockpit or simulator.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
