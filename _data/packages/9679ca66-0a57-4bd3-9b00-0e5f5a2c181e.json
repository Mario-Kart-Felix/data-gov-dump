Point estimates of species richness, Shannon's diversity (H), and Evenness were derived from Reef Visual Census (RVC) Surveys. RVC surveys were conducted using a cooperative multi-agency Reef Fish Monitoring Protocol for the Florida Keys Coral Reef Ecosystem (Menza et al., 2006; Brandt et al., 2009). Data on fish occurence and abundance were collcted using a 200-m x 200-m polygon grid developed by The University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (UM-RSMAS) and the National Marine Fisheries Southeast Fisheries Science Center (NFMS-SEFSC). The grid forms the basis for a two-stage stratified random sampling allocation scheme that was developed to estimate important metrics for living resource populations (e.g., corals and reef fishes) in Southwest Florida, extending from Martin County in the northeast through the Florida Keys to the Dry Tortugas in the southwest (Jeffrey et al., 2012; Ault et al., In Press).",
