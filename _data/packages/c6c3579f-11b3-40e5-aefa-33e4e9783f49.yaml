    solar resource potential for Hawaii.rnrn_Purpose:_  Provide information on the solar
    resource potential for Hawaii. The insolation values represent the average solar
    energy available to a flat plate collector, such as a photovoltaic panel, oriented
    due south at an angle from horizontal equal to the latitude of the collector location.rnrn_Supplemental
    Information:_  This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total
    solar resource averaged over surface cells of approximately 40 km by 40 km in size.
    This data was developed from the Climatological Solar Radiation (CSR) Model. The
    CSR model was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S.
    Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Maxwell,
    George and Wilcox (1998) and George and Maxwell (1999). This model uses information
    on cloud cover, atmostpheric water vapor and trace gases, and the amount of aerosols
    in the atmosphere to calculate the monthly average daily total insolation (sun and
    sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The cloud cover data used as input to the
    CSR model are an 7-year histogram (1985-1991) of monthly average cloud fraction
    provided for grid cells of approximately 40km x 40km in size. Thus, the spatial
    resolution of the CSR model output is defined by this database. The data are obtained
    from the National Climatic Data Center in Ashville, North Carolina, and were developed
    from the U.S. Air Force Real Time Nephanalysis (RTNEPH) program. Atmospheric water
    vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. The procedures
    for converting the collector at latitude tilt are described in Marion and Wilcox
    (1994). Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate
    the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meterological input
    to the model, since some of the input parameters are not avalible at a 40km resolution.
    As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately
    10% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other
    micoclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within
    a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase
    with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain.
