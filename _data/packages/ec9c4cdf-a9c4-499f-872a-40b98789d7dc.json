		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

	"notes": "Most complex aerospace systems have many text reports on safety, maintenance, and associated issues. The Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) spans several decades and contains over 700 000 reports. The Aviation Safety Action Plan (ASAP) contains over 12 000 reports from various airlines. Problem categorizations have been developed for both ASRS and ASAP to enable identification of system problems. However, repository volume and complexity make human analysis difficult. Multiple experts are needed, and they often disagree on classifications. Even the same person has classified the same document differently at different times due to evolving experiences. Consistent classification is necessary to support tracking trends in problem categories over time. A decision support system that performs consistent document classification quickly and over large repositories would be useful. We discuss the results of two algorithms we have developed to classify ASRS and ASAP documents. The first is Mariana---a support vector machine (SVM) with simulated annealing, which is used to optimize hyperparameters for the model. The second method is classification built on top of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), which attempts to find a model that represents document features that add up in various combinations to form documents. We tested both methods on ASRS and ASAP documents with the latter categorized two different ways. We illustrate the potential of NMF to provide document features that are interpretable and indicative of topics. We also briefly discuss the tool that we have incorporated Mariana into in order to allow human experts to provide feedback on the document categorizations.",
