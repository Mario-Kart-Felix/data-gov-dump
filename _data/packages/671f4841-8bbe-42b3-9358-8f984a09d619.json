	"notes": "To improve aviation safety with anticipated growth in capacity, it is necessary to develop flight control technologies that enable safe operations as anomalous conditions occur.  These developments are particularly important to reduce fatal loss of control accidents due to aircraft degradation and abrupt aerodynamic changes including upsets.  It is necessary to develop methods to identify and characterize anomalies in flight, as well as to estimate the impacts on the flight envelope and the ability to effect control forces for recovery and/or flight planning to achieve safe landing.  An approach to identify anomalies including aerodynamic upsets based on model-based fault detection methods will be combined with physics-based models to assess the impact on the aircraft flight envelope and controllability.  These tools will permit off-line analysis and will facilitate the development of on-board guidance and control algorithms to support NASA goals for greater aircraft resiliency during adverse flight conditions.  In Phase I, development and demonstration of a generalized system architecture to identify and assess the effects of aircraft anomalies will be performed, which builds upon previous work toward model-based aircraft upset detection.  Phase I demonstrations will include simulation evaluation for a generic transport aircraft and test demonstration for a small unmanned aircraft. ",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
