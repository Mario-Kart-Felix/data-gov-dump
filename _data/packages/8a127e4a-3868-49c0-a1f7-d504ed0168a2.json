	"notes": "Since high temperature Sm-Co based magnets were developed, a number of new applications have been introduced.  NASA?s Xe+ ion propulsion engine used in Deep Space I (DS-I) is a prime example. The magnets with coating perform well at temperatures up to 550?C.  Magnets without coating perform well in the current 10 kW Xe+ ion engines in the vacuum which exists in space and at temperatures up to 400?C. Additional challenges are expected in the missions NASA is planning.  The new missions, with higher-powered engines, include travel toward the sun, to Jupiter, and planets beyond. In these higher-powered engines (&gt; 10 kW) temperatures are expected to reach 550?C in vacuum to ~10-5 Torr.  Technical data of the high temperature Sm-Co in the conditions of the NASA?s new mission are needed.  rnThis program proposes to study the effects of radiation on physical and magnetic properties, and the thermal stability and its improvement, in vacuum at temperature up to 550?C, of Sm-Co high temperature magnets.  Based on the results of this work, improvements to Sm-Co magnets will be made to enhance the performance of high power Xe+ ion propulsion engines.rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
