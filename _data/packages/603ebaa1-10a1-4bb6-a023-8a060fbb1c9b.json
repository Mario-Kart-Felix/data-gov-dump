	"notes": "distributions of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are computed using a two-fold process. Where nnapplicable, the proportional contribution of subnational units are determined following the methodology of Sachs et al. (2003) and nnthese proportions are used against World Bank Development Indicators to determine a GDP value for the subnational unit. Once a nnnational GDP has been spatially stratified into the smallest administrative units available, it is further distributed based upon nnGridded Population of the World, Version 3 (GPWv3) population distributions. A per capita contribution value is determined for each nnunit, and this value is multiplied by the population per grid cell. Once the GDP has been determined on a per grid cell basis, then nnthe spatially variable loss rate as derived from EM-DAT historical records is used to determine the total economic loss posed to a nngrid cell by volcano hazards. The final surface does not present absolute values of total economic loss, but rather a relative decile nn(1-10) ranking of grid cells based upon the calculated economic loss risks. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the nnColumbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World nnBank, and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
