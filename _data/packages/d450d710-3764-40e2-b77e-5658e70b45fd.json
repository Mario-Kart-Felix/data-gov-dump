	"notes": "Rotorcrafts form a unique subset of air vehicles in that a rotorcraft'snpropulsion system is used not only for propulsion, but it also serves asnthe primary source of lift and maneuvering of the vehicle.  No other airnvehicle relies on the propulsion system to provide these functionsnthrough a transmission system employing a single critical load pathnwithout duplication or redundancy.  Thus it is critically important tonmonitor the drivetrain components in rotorcraft propulsion systems innorder to detect the onset of damage or abnormal conditions.  We proposento develop an analyzer for rotorcraft health monitoring.  Our proposedndevice, an oil debris monitor that relies on optical means to monitornthe fluid content, will provide a means to monitor the gear and bearingnwear that is common in rotating machinery.  This device will be based onnfluid analyzers previously developed for industry.  Our sensor willnprovide a means to detect the onset of failure using optical techniques.nIt will be more sensitive than electromagnetic sensors.  In addition itnwill be able to detect all debris, metallic and non-metallic, includingnthose generated by hybrid ceramic bearings, and will be able to do thisneven in the presence of air bubbles.  Unlike other optical sensors, ourndevice will be fabricated from a glass monolith and will, by its verynnature, stay aligned forever, even when submitted to severe vibrationsnand shocks.  Within the glass monolith our sensor will integrate thenequivalent of two optical instruments, one optimized for largenmillimeter-size debris and one for smaller micron-size debris.nAlgorithms will be developed to merge the data provided by the twonoptical channels and to present a simple cohesive health assessment.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
