    Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate&amp;#39;s Integrated Systems Research Program,
    the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Project explores and documents the
    feasibility, benefits and technical risk of vehicle concepts and enabling technologies
    to reduce aviation&amp;rsquo;s impact on the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Current-generation
    aircraft already benefit from the NASA investments in aeronautical research that
    have improved fuel efficiencies, lowered noise levels and reduced harmful emissions.
    Although substantial progress has been made, much more needs to be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
    /&gt;Forecasts call for the nation&amp;#39;s air transportation system to expand
    significantly within the next two decades. Such an expansion could bring adverse
    environmental impacts. To neutralize or reduce these impacts is the goal of the
    ERA Project and its focused research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The project is organized
    to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mature promising technology and advanced aircraft
    configurations that meet mid-term goals &amp;mdash; in the next five to 10 years
    &amp;mdash; for community noise, fuel burn and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions as
    described in the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/aero-rdplan-2010.pdf"&gt;National
    Aeronautics Research and Development Plan&lt;/a&gt; and;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determine
    the potential impact of these advanced aircraft designs and technologies if successfully
    implemented into the air transportation system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research
    Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To enable advanced aircraft configurations
    that might enter service by 2025, the ERA Project is working on technologies that
    will simultaneously:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce
    aircraft drag by 8&#37;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce aircraft weight by 10&#37;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce
    engine specific fuel consumption by 15&#37;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce oxides of
    nitrogen emissions of the engine by 75&#37;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce aircraft
    noise by 1/8 compared with current standards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br
    /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ERA Project is comprised
    of three subprojects: Airframe Technology, Propulsion Technology and Vehicle Systems
    Integration. Work within the project is coordinated with system-level research performed
    by other programs within NASA&amp;#39;s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate
    as well as other federal government agencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NASA has also
    put mechanisms in place to engage academia and industry, including working groups
    and technical interchange meetings; Space Act Agreements for cooperative partnerships;
    and the NASA Research Announcement process that provides for full and open competition
    for the best and most promising research ideas. The ERA Project disseminates all
    of its research results to the widest practical extent.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
