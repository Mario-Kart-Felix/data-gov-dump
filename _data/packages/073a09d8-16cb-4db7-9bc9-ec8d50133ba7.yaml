  a standardized tool for examining spatial patterns in abundance and demographic
  trends of the southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis), based on data collected
  during the spring 2015 range-wide census. The USGS range-wide sea otter census has
  been undertaken twice a year since 1982, once in May and once in October, using
  consistent methodology involving both ground-based and aerial-based counts. The
  spring census is considered more accurate than the fall count, and provides the
  primary basis for gauging population trends by State and Federal management agencies.
  This Shape file includes a series of summary statistics derived from the raw census
  data, including sea otter density (otters per square km of habitat), linear density
  (otters per km of coastline), relative pup abundance (ratio of pups to independent
  animals) and 5-year population trend (calculated as exponential rate of change).
  All statistics are calculated and plotted for small sections of habitat in order
  to illustrate local variation in these statistics across the entire mainland distribution
  of sea otters in California (as of 2015). Sea otter habitat is considered to extend
  offshore from the mean low tide line and out to the 60m isobath: this depth range
  includes over 99% of sea otter feeding dives, based on dive-depth data from radio
  tagged sea otters (Tinker et al 2006, 2007). Sea otter distribution in California
  (the mainland range) is considered to comprise this band of potential habitat stretching
  along the coast of California, and bounded to the north and south by range limits
  defined as \"the points farthest from the range center at which 5 or more otters
  are counted within a 10km contiguous stretch of coastline (as measured along the
  10m bathymetric contour) during the two most recent spring censuses, or at which
  these same criteria were met in the previous year\". The polygon corresponding to
  the range definition was then sub-divided into onshore/offshore strips roughly 500
  meters in width. The boundaries between these strips correspond to ATOS (As-The-Otter-Swims)
  points, which are arbitrary locations established approximately every 500 meters
  along a smoothed 5 fathom bathymetric contour (line) offshore of the State of California.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
