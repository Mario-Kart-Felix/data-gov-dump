		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

	"notes": "The environmental impact of aviation is enormous given the fact thatrnin the US alone there are nearly 6 million flights per year of commercial aircraft.rnThis situation has driven numerous policy and procedural measures to help developrnenvironmentally friendly technologies which are safe and affordable and reduce thernenvironmental impact of aviation. However, many of these technologies require significantrninitial investment in newer aircraft fleets and modifications to existing regulationsrnwhich are both long and costly enterprises. We propose to use an anomalyrndetection method based on Virtual Sensors to help detect overconsumption of fuel inrnaircraft which relies only on the data recorded during flight of most existing commercialrnaircraft, thus significantly reducing the cost and complexity of implementing thisrnmethod. The Virtual Sensors developed here are ensemble-learning regression modelsrnfor detecting the overconsumption of fuel based on instantaneous measurementsrnof the aircraft state. This approach requires no additional information about standardrnoperating procedures or other encoded domain knowledge. We present experimentalrnresults on three data sets and compare five different Virtual Sensors algorithms. Thernfirst two data sets are publicly available and consist of a simulated data set from arnflight simulator and a real-world turbine disk.We show the ability to detect anomaliesrnwith high accuracy on these data sets. These sets contain seeded faults, meaning thatrnthey have been deliberately injected into the system. The second data set is from realworldrnfleet of 84 jet aircraft where we show the ability to detect fuel overconsumptionrnwhich can have a significant environmental and economic impact. To the best of ourrnknowledge, this is the first study of its kind in the aviation domain.",
