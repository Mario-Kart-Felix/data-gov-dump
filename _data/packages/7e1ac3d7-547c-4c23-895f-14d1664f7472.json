	"notes": "A novel and robust flow control technique for the virtual shaping of extended run Natural Laminar Flow (NLF) sections has been developed.  The virtual shaping and separation control technology can be used to control the size and extent of extremely large separation bubbles to virtually shape the aft recovery region of the airfoil.  The system uses a novel pressure porting technique that requires no external air source to produce a pulsed tangential jet in the separated region capable of partially or fully eliminating the presence of the separation bubble.  The novel pulsed jet system was shown to produce equivalent results to continuous blowing using approximately a 42&#37; lower jet velocity and 87&#37; lower momentum coefficient.  The virtual shaping of an extended run NLF section could offer radical performance enhancement in the form of increased lift-to-drag and maximum lift.  Additionally, the system will produce a wing design enabling a hinge-less, full-span virtual shaping capability, which can be used for pilot reactive roll control, span load tailoring, and gust load alleviation.  The system will provide significantly enhanced performance for the air vehicle throughout the entire flight envelope.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
