    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "This paper proposes u0002first principles
    based modeling and prognostics approach for electrolytic capacitors. Electrolytic
    capacitors and MOSFETs are the two major components, which cause degradations and
    failures in DC-DC converters. This type of capacitors are known for its low reliability
    and frequent breakdown on critical systems like power supplies of avionics equipment
    and electrical drivers of electro-mechanical actuators. Some of the more prevalent
    fault effects, such as a ripple voltage surge at the power supply output can cause
    glitches in the GPS position and velocity output, and this, in turn, if not corrected
    will propagate and distort the navigation solution. Prognostics provides a way to
    assess remaining useful life of a capacitor based on its current state of health
    and its anticipated future usage and operational conditions. In this paper, we study
    the effects of accelerated aging due to thermal stress on sets of capacitors. Our
    focus is on deriving u0002rst principles degradation models for thermal stress conditions.
    The degradation data form the basis for developing the model based remaining life
    prediction algorithm. Our overall goal is to derive accurate models of capacitor
    degradation, and use them to predict performance changes in DC-DC converters.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
