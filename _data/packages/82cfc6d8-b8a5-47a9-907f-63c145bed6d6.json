	"notes": "The process known as double bag vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (DBVARTM) was developed by NASA to help deplete by products.  To date, the NASA DBVARTM process has reduced void content to approximately four to five percent.  This number has fallen short of the goal of two percent.  During the Phase I effort, San Diego Composites (SDC) was able to reduce the void content to 0.8 percent to 1.5 percent.   \r\nThere are three primary technical objectives to the Phase II effort.  The first objective is to perform a trade study to evaluate and optimize the effect of stitched performs.  Stitching has had a large effect on the void content in the laminate and several different stitching variables will be evaluated.  The second objective is to transition the work done in Phase I to larger components.  These components will consist of larger plates and structures will be evaluated using non destructive testing along with mechanical testing.  At the end of the Phase II effort, a full scale component will be fabricated, evaluated using non destructive testing, and then the component will be tested. The final objective is to transition the technology to Boeing Phantom Works.  This objective will demonstrate that the process developed in a laboratory can be reproduced at any facility.  By the end of the Phase II program, the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is expected to be 5-6.\r\n",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
