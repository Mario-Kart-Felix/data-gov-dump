    http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov. The subject file represents Census Blocks 2000
    for the State of Arkansas. It is a registered trademark of the Bureau of the Census
    and an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census
    TIGER database. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county
    or statistical equivalent entity, based on January 1, 2000 legal boundaries. A complete
    set of files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the
    United States and Puerto Rico. Files for the Island Areas are not included. The
    Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps
    between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone
    as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation.
    The files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental
    and statistical boundaries. They do NOT contain the ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)
    and the address ranges are of approximately the same vintage as those appearing
    in the 1999 TIGER/Line files. That is, the Census Bureau is producing these files
    in advance of the computer processing that will ensure that the address ranges in
    the TIGER/Line files agree with the final Master Address File (MAF) used for tabulating
    Census 2000. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types
    for the spatial objects of a county. There are 17 record types, including the basic
    data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used
    with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained
    in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class
    codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes codes
    for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and
    point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features,
    and area boundaries.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
