	"notes": "Circa 2001 land use / land cover (LULC) for the Lake Champlain Basin. The goal in creating this layer was to generate an "improved" version of NLCD 2001 using ancillayr GIS data and Landsat satellite imagery. The Lake Champlain Basin Program (LCBP) is a joint federal-state initiative that helps to monitor and protect Lake Champlain and its contributing watersheds. One area of particular concern is nutrient loading to the Lake, particularly phosphorus (P), from terrestrial and non-lake sources. In order to quantify how much P is entering the lake, it is crucial to have an accurate representation of land use for the Basin. This layer represents an updated digital land use - land cover (LULC) map for the entire Lake Champlain Basin, termed LCB 2001. This updated LULC layer was generated by using an expert system that integrated the 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) with ancillary GIS datasets and circa 2001 Landsat satellite imagery. A primary focus of this expert system was to improve the mapping accuracy of the agriculture LULC class by reducing the confusion with urban open space. An accuracy assessment was carried out by comparing the classification to temporally comparable high resolution imagery. The overall accuracy of LCB 2001 was 88%. The user's accuracy for the urban and agricultural classes, those considered to be the greatest sources of phosphorous, was 84% and 89% respectively. LCB 2001 was produced largely by improving NLCD 2001 using ancillary data. The process of generating LCB 2001 was comprised of three phases: 1) overlay of roads, 2) expert system classification, and 3) assessment and manual correction. Phase 1 was carried out using the aggregate 8-class version of NLCD 2001. The corrected road vector lines were converted to a raster layer with a cell size and alignment matching that of NLCD 2001. The road pixels were incorporated into the NLCD 2001 layer using standard raster overlay procedures in which any pixel in NLCD 2001 that corresponded with a road pixel was reassigned to the urban category. The expert system was employed largely to deal with the accuracy issues surrounding agriculture and urban open land. Edge effects and registration differences between NLCD 2001 and the improved CLU layer made simply overlaying the two an unacceptable solution. To overcome this limitation the expert system was developed and deployed using Definiens Professional software (Definiens AG, Munich, Germany). The expert system took advantage of Definiens Professional's ability to "segment" object polygons from image and thematic raster layers. Image object polygons are groups of pixels with similar spectral and spatial characteristics. Image object polygons allow for the inclusion of rules based on complex topological relationships. Image object polygons for this project were derived from both the spring and fall circa 2001 Landsat satellite scenes, but were constrained to the boundaries of the Improved CLU layer and NLCD 2001. Thus, each object polygon consisted of groups of pixels that were spectrally and spatially similar and share the same attributes with respect to the Improved CLU layer and the NLCD 2001 layer. The expert system first evaluated whether or not the object fell into the confirmed agriculture or urban-open categories based on the Improved CLU layer. If either of these tests proved true then the object was assigned to the corresponding class. If the test failed then the alternate scenarios were evaluated. For objects originally classified as agriculture in NLCD 2001 the object was assigned to the output agriculture class only if the object bordered an object already classified as agriculture (to deal with edge effects and layer alignment issues) or if the object was also in the improved CLU layer's possible agriculture category. This rule ran in an iterative loop to compensate for the fact that once objects were classified as agriculture they would influence other border objects. The rule only stopped executing once all objects were finished changing their class assignment. If the object was not assigned to the output agriculture class at this stage (those classified as agriculture in NLCD 2001, but not in LCB 2001) it was evaluated using a series of spectral and spatial rules to assign it to the output brush or urban-open classes. This set of spectral and spatial rules applied a fuzzy class assignment. The object was considered to be more likely to be brush the darker it was and the further it was from urban areas. The object was considered more likely to be urban if it was near urban areas and brighter. For all other classes the objects adopted the NLCD 2001 class. Following the running of the expert system the output classification was manually compared to the Landsat imagery and any objects that appeared to be misclassified were reassigned. As the goal of the project was to maintain as much consistency with NLCD 2001 as possible the layer was maintained in its original coordinate system - USA Albers Equal Area Conic, USGS Version, NAD83 datum (meters).",
