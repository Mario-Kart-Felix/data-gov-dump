    simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census Bureau's
    Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing
    (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed for
    small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the
    intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain
    the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas
    may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available
    as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.nnA consolidated
    city is a unit of local government for which the functions of an incorporated place
    and its county or minor civil division (MCD) have merged.  This action results in
    both the primary incorporated place and the county or MCD continuing to exist as
    legal entities, even though the county or MCD performs few or no governmental functions
    and has few or no elected officials.  Where this occurs, and where one or more other
    incorporated places in the county or MCD continue to function as separate governments,
    even though they have been included in the consolidated government, the primary
    incorporated place is referred to as a consolidated city.  The Census Bureau classifies
    the separately incorporated places within the consolidated city as place entities
    and creates a separate place (balance) record for the portion of the consolidated
    city not within any other place.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
