  system sits within a ~15 km wide left-step in a major west-dipping range-bounding
  normal fault system. The step over is defined by the Independence Mountains fault
  zone and the Bull Runs Mountains fault zone which overlap along strike. Strain is
  transferred between these major fault segments via and array of northerly striking
  normal faults with offsets of 10s to 100s of meters and strike lengths of less than
  5 km. These faults within the step over are one to two orders of magnitude smaller
  than the range-bounding fault zones between which they reside. Faults within the
  broad step define an anticlinal accommodation zone wherein east-dipping faults mainly
  occupy western half of the accommodation zone and west-dipping faults lie in the
  eastern half of the accommodation zone. The 3D model of Tuscarora encompasses 70
  small-offset normal faults that define the accommodation zone and a portion of the
  Independence Mountains fault zone, which dips beneath the geothermal field.  The
  geothermal system resides in the axial part of the accommodation, straddling the
  two fault dip domains. The Tuscarora 3D geologic model consists of 10 stratigraphic
  units. Unconsolidated Quaternary alluvium has eroded down into bedrock units, the
  youngest and stratigraphically highest bedrock units are middle Miocene rhyolite
  and dacite flows regionally correlated with the Jarbidge Rhyolite and modeled with
  uniform cumulative thickness of ~350 m. Underlying these lava flows are Eocene volcanic
  rocks of the Big Cottonwood Canyon caldera. These units are modeled as intracaldera
  deposits, including domes, flows, and thick ash deposits that change in thickness
  and locally pinch out. The Paleozoic basement of consists metasedimenary and metavolcanic
  rocks, dominated by argillite, siltstone, limestone, quartzite, and metabasalt of
  the Schoonover and Snow Canyon Formations. Paleozoic formations are lumped in a
  single basement unit in the model. Fault blocks in the eastern portion of the model
  are tilted 5-30 degrees toward the Independence Mountains fault zone. Fault blocks
  in the western portion of the model are tilted toward steeply east-dipping normal
  faults. These opposing fault block dips define a shallow extensional anticline.
  Geothermal production is from 4 closely-spaced wells, that exploit a west-dipping,
  NNE-striking fault zone near the axial part of the accommodation zone.\",\n\t\t\"format\":
