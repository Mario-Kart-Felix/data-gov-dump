    of sage-grouse habitat suitability index (HSI) values for Nevada during the winter
    season, and is a surrogate for habitat conditions during periods of cold and snow.
    Summary of steps to create Habitat Categories: HABITAT SUITABILITY INDEX: The HSI
    was derived from a generalized linear mixed model (specified by binomial distribution
    and created using ArcGIS 10.2.2) that contrasted data from multiple environmental
    factors at used sites (telemetry locations) and available sites (random locations).
    Predictor variables for the model represented vegetation communities at multiple
    spatial scales, water resources, habitat configuration, urbanization, roads, elevation,
    ruggedness, and slope. Vegetation data was derived from various mapping products,
    which included NV SynthMap (Petersen 2008, SageStitch (Comer et al. 2002, LANDFIRE
    (Landfire 2010), and the CA Fire and Resource Assessment Program (CFRAP 2006). The
    analysis was updated to include high resolution percent cover within 30 x 30 m pixels
    for Sagebrush, non-sagebrush, herbaceous vegetation, and bare ground (C. Homer,
    unpublished; based on the methods of Homer et al. 2014, Xian et al. 2015 ) and conifer
    (primarily pinyon-juniper, P. Coates, unpublished). The pool of telemetry data included
    the same data from 1998 - 2013 used by Coates et al. (2014); additional telemetry
    location data from field sites in 2014 were added to the dataset. The dataset was
    then split according calendar date into three seasons (spring, summer, winter).
    Winter included telemetry locations (n = 4862) from November to March. All age and
    sex classes of marked grouse were used in the analysis. Sufficient data (i.e., a
    minimum of 100 locations from at least 20 marked Sage-grouse) for modeling existed
    in 10 subregions for spring and summer, and seven subregions in winter, using all
    age and sex classes of marked grouse. It is important to note that although this
    map is composed of HSI values derived from the seasonal data, it does not explicitly
    represent habitat suitability for reproductive females (i.e., nesting and with broods).
    Insufficient data were available to allow for estimation of this habitat type for
    all seasons throughout the study area extent. A Resource Selection Function (RSF)
    was calculated for each subregion using R software (v 3.13) using generalized linear
    models to derive model-averaged parameter estimates for each covariate across a
    set of additive models. Subregional RSFs were transformed into Habitat Suitability
    Indices, and averaged together to produce an overall statewide HSI whereby a relative
    probability of occurrence was calculated for each raster cell during the winter
    season. In order to account for discrepancies in HSI values caused by varying ecoregions
    within Nevada, the HSI was divided into north and south extents using a slightly
    modified flood region boundary (Mason 1999) that was designed to represent respective
    mesic and xeric regions of the state. North and south HSI rasters were each relativized
    according to their maximum value to rescale between zero and one, then mosaicked
    once more into a state-wide extent. REFERENCES: California Forest and Resource Assessment
