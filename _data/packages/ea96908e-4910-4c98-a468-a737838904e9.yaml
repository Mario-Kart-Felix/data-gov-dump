    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;The original objective was to ensure
    that the grism assembly can be designed and fabricated to meet the WFIRST spectrometer
    requirements. The current grism design includes an innovative Variable Space Grating
    (VSG) that borrowed a concept from Computer Generated Hologram, plus spectral filter
    and prism. From optical design point of view, this IRAD will study how much we can
    further simplify the grism design without compromising the scientific objectives.&amp;nbsp;
    We&amp;rsquo;ll make every effort to search for all state of art optical fabrication
    techniques and to design the optics that uses the most suitable technologies.&amp;nbsp;
    This is one way to raise TRL level.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, we&amp;#39;ll fund
    the potential vendors to study and design the element(s) to our specification.&amp;nbsp;
    We will interact with them and leverage their expertise to raise the TRL.&amp;nbsp;
    &amp;nbsp;Meanwhile, we&amp;#39;ll encourage them to develop new fabrication methods
    to improve the quality and to reduce the cost. We would like to eliminate the complicated
    Zernike Sag Surface (ZSS), a surface that could provide any surface figure we need
    to compensate aberrations, from the current design.&amp;nbsp; But we cannot rule
    it out yet until we have a solid design without ZSS.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, we will
    fund a potential vendor in this IRAD to study ZSS fabrication.&amp;nbsp; If the
    funding permits, we will ask the potential vendors to make small scale samples and
    test them at GSFC. &amp;nbsp;The goal of this IRAD is to achieve TRL 4; the current
    TRL is roughly TRL 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the course of this IRAD, it is discovered
    that a diffractive lens is a much better way to compensate the&amp;nbsp;wavelength
    dependent aberration created by&amp;nbsp;a grating in non-collimated space.&amp;nbsp;
    Besides the much improved&amp;nbsp;image quality, the corss due to unwanted diffraction
    orders can be spread&amp;nbsp;as an uniform background by skillfully designing the
    diffractive lens and VSG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full project includes design a buildable
    slitless spectrometer, analyze the design and provide tolerance data to mechanical
    team.&amp;nbsp; The mechanical team will design a cryo assembly with multi-degrees
    of adjustment.&amp;nbsp; The high risky samples for diffractive lens and VSG will
    be procured and tested.&amp;nbsp; One good news to report is that grating sample
    delivered to us this week has a very high diffraction efficiency (over 90&#37;)
    from today&amp;#39;s test result, which is higher than HST&amp;#39;s ~80&#37; level.This
    is equivalent to to increase the primary mirror size by 10&#37;.&amp;nbsp; This
    also makes the uniform background due to unwanted grating much lower.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
