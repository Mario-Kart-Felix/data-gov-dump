	"notes": "This data set contains point locations of active volcanoes as compiled by Motyka et al., 1993. Eighty-nine volcanoes with eruptive phases in the Quaternary are mapped as points centered in the active caldera or volcano summit. Volcanoes with a number of satellite vents and/or cones distributed around the main caldera or summit are given a unique identifier so it is clear that geothermal activity is likely to be found away from the point on the map. Different volcanic morphologies (Strato, Composite, Sheild) and eruptive histories are not noted in the digital data set, though this information was originally included in the Motyka et al. publication.This data set comprises a portion of the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) data for Aleutians East Borough and Aleutians West Coastal Resource Service Area (CRSA). These data identify the marine and coastal environments and wildlife. The ESI data include information for three main components: shoreline habitats, sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources.",
