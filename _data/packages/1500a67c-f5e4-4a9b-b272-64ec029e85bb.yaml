    (LTRMP) annual fish monitoring began on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers
    in 1989. During the first two years samples were collected at a series of fixed
    sampling sites, then in 1993 a stratified random sampling approach was added to
    the collection effort. This approach utilizes a computer routine that randomly selects
    sampling sites from a pool of potential sites that have been categorized by strata
    (e.g., aquatic habitat type, distance to shore, connectivity to main channel). The
    results from these collections are stored in an Oracle database at the Upper Midwest
    Environmental Science Center (UMESC). UMESC provides free access to the data through
    the Centers Web site (www.umesc.usgs.gov). Several methods/routines are available
    for accessing the data (e.g., graphical browser, GIS query tool) this particular
    file is designed to accompany the main Oracle database (http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/data_library/fisheries/fish_page.html).",nt"license_title":
