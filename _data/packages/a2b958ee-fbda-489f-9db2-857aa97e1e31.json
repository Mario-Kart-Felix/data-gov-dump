		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

	"notes": "In this paper we propose an innovative learning algorithm - a variation of One-class u0017 Support Vector Machines (SVMs) learning algorithm to produce sparser solutions with much reduced computational complexities. The proposed technique returns an approximate solution, nearly as good as the solution set obtained by the classical approach, by minimizing the original risk function along with a regularization term. We introduce a bi-criterion optimization that helps guide the search towards the optimal set in much reducedrntime. The outcome of the proposed learning technique was compared with the benchmark one-class Support Vector machines algorithm which more often leads to solutions withrnredundant support vectors. Through out the analysis, the problem size for both optimization routines was kept consistent.rnWe have tested the proposed algorithm on a variety of data sources under different conditions to demonstrate the effectiveness. In all cases the proposed algorithm closely preserves the accuracy of standard one-class u0017 SVMs while reducing both training time and test time by several factors.",
