    backscatter mosaic of the St. John Shelf, US Virgin Islands. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA
    Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory,
    federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the
    US Virgin Islands from March 18 2010 to April 06 2010. Data was acquired with a
    hull-mounted Reson 7125 Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (400 kHz)
    and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors
    applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water
    (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north,
    datum WGS84. The backscatter component of the bathymetry data were geometrically
    and radiometrically corrected using Hypack 2010 Geocoder software. Acoustic backscatter
    mosaics are ostensibly an important piece of information when characterizing surficial
    seafloor features and delineating benthic habitats. The project was conducted to
    meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependent on the project area and depth.
    All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to
    their own needs and standards.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
