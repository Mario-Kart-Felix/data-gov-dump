    false,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "This study was designed to determine if
    the use of agricultural pesticides and herbicides used in rice farming and Chinese
    tallow tree control have a noticeable effect on populations of amphibians on the
    Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge. Two hour searches by a two person team were conducted
    along specific transects in a moist soil management unit, rice fields, and fallowed
    rice fields, twice a month between March and July, and once a month between August
    and November for two years. All amphibians seen or heard were recorded, or captured
    when possible, and examined for gross malformations. Small dip nets were used to
    collect tadpoles for external examination and growth observations. Three herbicides
    [Stam M-4 (propanil), Grazon P+D (picloram + 2,4-D) and Arrosolo (propanil + molinate)]
    that were approved for use, and used on the Refuge during the study, were tested
    for toxicity in the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay - Xenopus (FETAX) of these chemicals
    to larval amphibians. Dose-response curves are presented and the LC50s were calculated
    for Grazon P+D and Arrosolo (33% propanil, 33% molinate). Stam M-4 did not yield
    a definitive test. The LC50 for Grazon P+D was between 25 and 50 mg/L and for Arrosolo
    the LC50 was 13.5 mg/L. Calculated exposure concentration of Arrosolo used in rice
    farming on the Refuge was less than 0.6 mg/L, which is 200 times lower than the
    LC50 determined in the FETAX assay. Fourteen species of frogs, toads and salamanders
    were recorded on the Refuge during this study. Three species (three-toed amphiuma,
    western lesser siren and pig frog) were not previously recorded in Chambers County,
    Texas. Six species of amphibians recorded from Chambers County (Dixon 1987) were
    not seen during this study (Table 1). In August the moist soil management unit generally
    contained the largest population of amphibians averaging 26 individuals per hectare
    and represented 10 species. The rice fields had the second largest population of
    amphibians and averaged 24 individuals per hectare, representing 11 species, during
    July. The rice field was usually drained and left to dry out in August for harvesting.
    The fallowed rice fields had only eight species of amphibians and much lower densities.
    These fields were not flooded and stayed dry for long time periods during the drought
    period of 1999 and 2000. Surveys in the months of December, January, or February
    did not yield any amphibians along the transects. There were no malformed frogs,
    toads or tadpoles collected during this study which indicates that the herbicides
    currently used on the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge are not having a measurable
    adverse effect on the amphibian populations. Habitat alteration such as discing,
    leveling, and terracing the area for rice planting appeared to have a large but
    short-term negative effect on the presence, reproduction and abundance of amphibians.
    The role of concentrating predators such as birds, snakes and mammals, in the moist
    soil unit and the rice fields on the amphibian populations was not evaluated, but
    appears as if it could be substantial.",nt"license_title": "License Not Specified",nt"extras":
