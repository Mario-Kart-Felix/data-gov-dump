	"notes": "The proposed effort addresses a need for accurate computational models to support aeroassist and entry vehicle system design over a broad range of flight conditions including direct entry and aerocapture trajectories for manned and unmanned earth return and planetary exploration.  These models are critical for assessing aerodynamic characteristics including reaction control systems (RCS) influences and for designing thermal protection systems involving both ablating and non-ablating materials.  A hybrid approach unifying continuum CFD and rarefied DSMC flow solvers will be developed that can handle both higher altitude continuum flows, i.e. 60~85km, with embedded rarefied zones such as the base/near-wake region as well as higher altitude rarefied flows with embedded continuum zones such as RCS jet plumes. The proposed model will automatically separate continuum and rarefied regions into distinct computational domains employing a unique methodology demonstrated in Phase I to construct hybrid interface surfaces for complex three-dimensional geometries.  The model will incorporate RCS jet and advanced ablative models and will provide consistent nonequilibrium thermochemical modeling between the CFD and DSMC solutions.  This methodology provides a more efficient and accurate tool than provided by continuum CFD or DSMC alone and provides the flexibility to address a wide range of vehicle and system designs.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
