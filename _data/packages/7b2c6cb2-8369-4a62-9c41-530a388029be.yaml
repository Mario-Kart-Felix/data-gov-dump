  Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral
  reef ecosystems, from 16 October - 14 November 2008, reef fish assessment surveys
  were conducted, as a part of Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA), during the Pacific
  Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruise OES0810 in the Main Hawaiian
  Islands at biennial intervals by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the
  NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). During the cruise, 15 REA
  sites were surveyed at Oahu Island in the Main Hawaiian Islands. At the specific
  REA sites, fish biologists along with coral biologists, algal biologists and marine
  invertebrate zoologist entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~300 m2) and
  high degree of taxonomic resolution REA survey to assess and monitor species composition,
  abundance, percent cover, size distribution, diversity, and general health of fish,
  corals, macro-invertebrates, and algae in shallow-water (< 35 m) habitats. Reef
  fish assessment surveys were focused on cataloging the diversity (species richness),
  abundance (numeric density [# fish 100 m-2] and biomass density [kg 100 m-2]) of
  diurnally active reef fish assemblages. Three complementary noninvasive underwater
  survey methods were used, including belt-transect, stationary point count, and roving-diver
  surveys. For all methods, fish were identified at the species level, when possible,
  and assigned to a size bin ranging from 1 to 200 cm based on a visual estimate of
  total fish length. Belt-transect (BLT) surveys were used to quantify the entire
  diurnal fish community (all size classes). In belt-transect surveys, two fish biologists
  swam side-by-side along three consecutively-placed, 25m transect lines. The BLT
  team swam each transect two times. During the initial swim-out, each fish diver
  recorded all fish larger than 20 cm observed within a 4-m wide belt perpendicular
  to their respective side of the transect (200 m2 area per line, 100 m2 per diver).
  On the return swim, each fish diver recorded all fish less than 20 cm observed within
  a 2-m wide belt (100 m2 area per line, 50 m2 per diver). The survey of large fish
  took approximately 5 min to complete while the survey of smaller fish took about
  10 min to complete. All reef-associated fish, including those in the water column
  (including planktivores), were counted. Any coastal pelagic species (e.g., clupeids
  [sardines], belonids [beakfish], antherinids [silversides]) seen near the surface
  were not recorded. The stationary point count (SPC) method were used to quantify
  larger, more mobile reef fish species that can be missed on belt-transect surveys.
  In stationary point count survey, a fish biologist swam approximately 15 m away
  from a transect line concurrently being surveyed by the other two BLT fish biologists.
  The SPC biologist then recorded all fish greater than 25 cm in length that passed
  within a visually estimated 20-m diameter cylinder centered on the diver's fixed
  position (10-m radius, total area = 314 m2). The survey time for each stationary
  point count survey was 5 min and a total of four stationary point count surveys
  were conducted at each REA site. Roving-diver surveys were followed belt-transect
  and stationary point count surveys. As diver bottom time permitted, the fish assessment
  team conducted random swim surveys throughout the REA site area, recording, to the
  species level or the lowest recognizable taxon, the presence of reef fish not encountered
  during previous methods.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\":
