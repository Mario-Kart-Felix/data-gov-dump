  Raster data file is included in \"BathymetryHS_PointReyes.zip,\" which is accessible
  from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/PointReyes/data_catalog_PointReyes.html. The bathymetry
  and shaded-relief maps of the Offshore of Point Reyes Map Area, California, were
  generated from bathymetry data collected by California State University, Monterey
  Bay (CSUMB), and by Fugro Pelagos. Mapping was completed between 2007 and 2010,
  using a combination of 200-kHz and 400-kHz Reson 7125, and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam
  echosounders, as well as 468-kHz SEA SWATHPlus interferometric system. These mapping
  missions combined to collect bathymetry from about the 10-m isobath to beyond the
  3-nautical-mile limit of California's State Waters. NOTE: the horizontal datum of
  the bathymetry data (NAD83) differs from the horizontal datum of other layers in
  this DS (WGS84). These data are not intended for navigational purposes.\",\n\t\"license_title\":
