    with 30x30 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of the Charleston Bump off
    of the South Atlantic Bight, derived from data collected in 2007 by the NOAA Ship
    Thomas Jefferson. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with
    the College of Charleston, as well as the NOAA Ship Nancy Foster , and private sector
    partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data off the Charleston Bump from 05/23/2007
    to 05/28/2007. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam
    echosounder (95 kHz). It was processed by the College of Charleston Department of
    Geology using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound
    velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved
    tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM Zone 17 north, datum NAD83. The
    processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle.
    The CARIS Export option "BASE Surface to Image" was then used to create a GeoTiff
    of the priority areas. Rugosity was derived from this surface using NOAA's Benthic
    Terrain Modeler extension.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
