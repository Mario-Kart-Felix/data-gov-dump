	"notes": "For the purposes of this paper, the NationalrnAirspace System (NAS) encompasses the operations of allrnaircraft which are subject to air traffic control procedures.rnThe NAS is a highly complex dynamic system that isrnsensitive to aeronautical decision-making and risk managementrnskills. In order to ensure a healthy system with safernflights a systematic approach to anomaly detection is veryrnimportant when evaluating a given set of circumstancesrnand for determination of the best possible course of action.rnGiven the fact that the NAS is a vast and loosely integratedrnnetwork of systems, it requires improved safety assurancerncapabilities to maintain an extremely low accident raternunder increasingly dense operating conditions. Data miningrnbased tools and techniques are required to support and aidrnoperatorsu2019 (such as pilots, management, or policy makers)rnoverall decision-making capacity. Within the NAS, thernability to analyze fleetwide aircraft data autonomously isrnstill considered a significantly challenging task. For ourrnpurposes a fleet is defined as a group of aircraft sharingrngenerally compatible parameter lists. Here, in this effort,rnwe aim at developing a system level analysis scheme. In thisrnpaper we address the capability for detection of fleetwidernanomalies as they occur, which itself is an importantrninitiative toward the safety of the real-world flight operations.rnThe flight data recorders archive millions of datarnpoints with valuable information on flights everyday. Thernoperational parameters consist of both continuous and discretern(binary & categorical) data from several critical subsystemsrnand numerous complex procedures. In this paper,rnwe discuss a system level anomaly detection approach basedrnon the theory of kernel learning to detect potential safetyrnanomalies in a very large data base of commercial aircraft.rnWe also demonstrate that the proposed approach uncoversrnsome operationally significant events due to environmental,rnmechanical, and human factors issues in high dimensional,rnmultivariate Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA)rndata. We present the results of our detection algorithms onrnreal FOQA data from a regional carrier.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
