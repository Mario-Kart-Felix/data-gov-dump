    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "&lt;p&gt;The main objective of this proposal
    is to perform a feasibility study for the use of NASA&amp;rsquo;s Tracking and Data
    Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) as the provider of communication services for NASA
    aircrafts. The feasibility study will lead us to the end goal of defining an airplane
    communication system architecture through TDRSS. The driver of this effort is to
    reduce costs of airborne missions and improve communication&amp;rsquo;s reliability.
    The NASA Airborne Science Program is an important part of the Earth Sciences Division
    within the Science Mission Directorate that provides &amp;ldquo;aircraft systems
    that further science and advance the use of satellite data&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
    It includes aircraft, e.g. the Wallops P3, and Dryden ER-2 and Global Hawk, with
    instruments that continue to advance the science achieved from these platforms,
    used by investigators from NASA, other government agencies and universities.&amp;nbsp;
    Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a successful history of airborne scientific
    instruments, for example the ER-2 Doppler Radar (EDOP), Cloud Radar System (CRS),
    the Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL), Conical Scanning Millimeter-wave Imaging Radiometer
    (CoSMIR), and others that have provided advances in cloud and precipitation remote
    sensing. The aircraft program also provides an avenue to test and fly instruments
    that can later be extended for observations from space. It is then logical to assume
    that as science advances, and higher data rates are desired for observations from
    space, this translates into the need for higher data rate communications from aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
    NASA aircraft platforms vary in the altitudes they can achieve, hence different
    communication needs are likely to exist. This study will look into trades including:
    available TDRSS services, required coverage, required data rates, communication
    links, communication frequency comparison (S vs. Ku vs. Ka-bands), and spectrum
    requirements. The end goal is to make a recommendation for the on-board communications
    system architecture to communicate airborne science data through TDRSS. This architecture
    would include recommendations on information data frames and packet formats to meet
    the existing infrastructure, modulation selection, number of instruments that can
    communicate through this architecture, and comm. subsystem hardware, including the
    antenna needed to meet the required links for tracking TDRSS. As part of this study,
    we would evaluate if one solution could exist that would be feasible for all NASA
    aircraft platforms. In addition, we would investigate the use of TDRSS in the Long
    Duration Balloon Program, which currently uses S-band TDRSS Services, and developments
    done for communications of sounding rockets. In the future, the process and savings
    outlined by achieving a NASA TDRSS Service for other platforms could be presented
    to the Global Hawk Operation offices for primary or secondary (backup) communications.&lt;/p&gt;",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
