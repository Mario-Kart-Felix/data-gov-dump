This network accommodates a land use pattern focused on fixed transit corridors linking regional and subregional centers while accommodating dispersed development along roadways. The network represents a balanced transportation network with modest investment in roadways and transit. The routes are based on data from the Louisiana State Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) Statewide Transportation Plan. Projects include transportation investments identified in the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) and projects from local Metropolitan Planning Organization Master Transportation Plans (MTP). The Louisiana Speaks Regional Plan process study area includes the 35 southernmost parishes of Louisiana.",
