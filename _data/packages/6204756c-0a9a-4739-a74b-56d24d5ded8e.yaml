    of approximately 150 raster-formatted data layers for the 7-county Twin Cities Metropolitan
    Area. It is available on CD-ROM in EPPL7 format. The data themes cover a wide range
    of physical and biological variables along with administrative, political, sociodemographic,
    and transportation data. Most data on the Metro30 data collection has been gridded
    at a 30-meter cell size from vector linework of varying scales. Some data layers
    were created from the MGC100 100-meter statewide data set by clipping the statewide
    file to the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area border, then resampling the data to the
    30-meter level. However, this processing step does not improve the original accuracy
    of the data. The Metro30 Dataset is available on the same CD as the MGC100 statewide
    100-meter dataset.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
