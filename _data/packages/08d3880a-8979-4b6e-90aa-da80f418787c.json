	"notes": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service supports recreational fishing in Refuge waters throughout the state of North Dakota. Recent research indicates popular commercial fish feeds used in farm and hatchery operations may contain significant amounts of contaminants that can accumulate in fish tissue. Previous research also indicated the possibility of high mercury and selenium levels in tissue of fish from Refuge lakes. We undertook this study to determine whether these contaminants are present in Refuge fish populations, and if so, whether contaminant concentrations in fish captured from Refuge lakes in North Dakota (ND) and eastern Montana (MT) pose a risk to members of the fishing public who consume their catch. Mercury concentrations in some species of fish were elevated above thresholds for concern for humans. Concentrations of selenium analyzed were generally below concentrations of concern for consumption advisories in these fish; however, detection levels for pesticides, PAHs, and PCBs were too high to draw conclusions regarding risks from those compounds. Based on the results for mercury, the ND Department of Health established fish consumption advisories for certain species and sizes of fish in Refuge lakes in ND, and the Service used ND guidance to develop fish consumption advisories for Medicine Lake in MT. The Service is posting signs at the Refuges to educate anglers about the advisories. Future monitoring at these sites will be needed to ensure that information for fish consumption advisories is up to date, as contaminant concentrations and knowledge of contaminant interactions may change over time. In addition to human health concerns, mercury and selenium concentrations in fish from all of the lakes exceeded recommended dietary concentrations for protecting birds that rely on the aquatic food web, so bird health and reproduction at and near these and similar lakes should be investigated further. In addition, the mercury concentrations measured in fish exceeded some thresholds for the health of the fish themselves and additional study of their reproduction and behavior may be warranted.",
