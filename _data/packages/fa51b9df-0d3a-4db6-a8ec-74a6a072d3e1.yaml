  Oregon, a 5 year project begun in 2010, tests recent technological advances designed
  to reduce the cost of power generated by EGS in a hot, dry well (NWG 55-29) drilled
  in 2008. First, the stimulation pumps used were designed to run for weeks and deliver
  large volumes of water at moderate well-head pressure. Second, to stimulate multiple
  zones, AltaRock developed thermo-degradable zonal isolation materials (TZIMs) to
  seal off fractures in a geothermal well to stimulate secondary and tertiary fracture
  zones. The TZIMs degrade within weeks, resulting in an optimized injection/ production
  profile of the entire well. Third, the project followed a project-specific Induced
  Seismicity Mitigation Plan (ISMP) to evaluate, monitor for, and mitigate felt induced
  seismicity. An initial stimulation was conducted in 2012 and continued for 7 weeks,
  with over 41,000 m3 of water injected. Further analysis indicated a shallow casing
  leak and an unstable formation in the open hole. The well was repaired with a shallow
  casing tieback and perforated liner in the open hole and re-stimulated in 2014.
  The second stimulation started September 23rd, 2014 and continued for 3 weeks with
  over 9,500 m3 of water injected. The well was treated with several batches of newly
  tested TZIM diverter materials and a newly designed Diverter Injection Vessel Assembly
  (DIVA), which was the main modification to the original injection system design
  used in 2012. A second round of stimulation that included two perforation shots
  and additional batches of TZIM was conducted on November 11th, 2014 for 9 days with
  an additional 4,000 m3 of water injected. The stimulations resulted in a 3-4 fold
  increase in injectivity, and PTS data indicates partial blocking and creation of
  flow zones near the bottom of the well.\",\n\t\t\"format\": \"PDF\",\n\t\t\"tracking_summary\":
