    Program (CRCP) long-term goals for sustainable management and conservation of coral
    reef ecosystems, towed-diver surveys (aka. towboard surveys) were conducted by the
    Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science
    Center (PIFSC) as part of biennial Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program
    (RAMP) Cruises. 15 towboard surveys (34.9386 km in length), were conducted at Ofu
    And Olosega Islands during the American Samoa RAMP Cruise HI0802 from 18 February
    - 19 March 2008. Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description
    of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied
    reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and
    abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for assessing
    trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic
    diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a
    depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat,
    and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the
    lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either
    side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to
    the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital
    video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover
    of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses
    a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea
    urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera
    which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent
    cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped
    with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals.
    Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using
    a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm
    is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the
    reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on
    the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the
    depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. This metadata applies
    to the benthic characterization observations.",nt"owner_org": "e811f0b4-451f-4896-9e8f-fc6802837819",nt"extras":
