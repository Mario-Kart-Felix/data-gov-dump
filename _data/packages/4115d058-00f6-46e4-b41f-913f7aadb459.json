	"notes": "The availability of remotely sensed data has been improving with each new high-resolution satellite obtaining operational capability in orbit. However, the ability of commercial and government entities to efficiently share or sell this  data has not kept pace. The proposed GeoSpatial data distribution system will exploit recent improvements in advanced computing environments and processing algorithms  to provide on demand products with a "no minimum purchase" requirement. rnrnThe inability of data providers to efficiently create and disseminate small foot prints or even on-demand data products has been a limiting factor in expanding the use of remotely sensed data.  Creating a system that can efficiently distribute data or products in small foot prints will greatly improve the economic viability of the entire industry. rnrnProviding a customer initiated order system will make ordering up remotely sensed data as easy as creating a Web-based profile and interactively selecting and downloading the raw-data of choice or choosing and executing the real-time development of a data product. Pay by the square kilometer with no minimums. Use of the advanced functions provide unprecedented functionality to create a new, customer defined data product.rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
