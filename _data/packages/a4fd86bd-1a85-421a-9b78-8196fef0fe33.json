	"notes": "The core planning algorithms to support the NGATS concepts will neednaccurate predictions of airport configuration over planning horizons ofnsix hours or more.  Such predictions are not currently feasible becausenthe configuration often is not completely determined by factors such asnweather forecasts, future demand, and noise restrictions that might beninput to an automated predictor.  When this is the case, the air trafficncontrol tower personnel choose between the feasible configurations basednon factors such as staffing issues and individual controllernpreferences.  Furthermore, the primary meteorological forecastsncurrently available to the tower are not adequate to enable accuratenrunway usage prediction.  In fact, they often fail to predict requirednchanges in flow direction, causing reactive rather than proactivenairport configuration management.  In this SBIR, Metron Aviation and WSInCorporation will jointly develop an airport configuration plannernincorporating optimized weather forecasts to assist tower controllers innplanning runway usage more accurately at longer time horizons thanncurrently possible and to communicate the plan to appropriate NationalnAirspace System (NAS) stakeholders and planning systems.  Thenoptimization algorithms in this decision support tool will improvenresource allocation not only at individual airports but also over allnairports in a metropolitan area.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
