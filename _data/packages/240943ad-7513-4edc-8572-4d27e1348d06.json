	"notes": "There are two data files with this data set in (.txt) format. The files contain net primary productivity (NPP) data and climate data for a mature tropical lowland rainforest at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. The La Selva forest reserve (10.43 N, 83.98 W) covers over 1,500 ha, of which 53% is primary forest and the rest is in various types of secondary forest and abandoned land.Above- and below-ground biomass, litterfall, root production, and nutrient content of different vegetation components and soils were determined in different areas of the biological station on different occasions between 1975 and 1994. Work has continued to the present day. Precipitation (1984-1997) and maximum\/minimum temperature (1992-1997) were measured at the forest study site.NPP has not been completely estimated although detailed data on forest dynamics are available from a variety of published and unpublished sources. A crude minimum estimate of NPP for La Selva was obtained by summing the estimates of litterfall [850 g\/m2\/year predicted for average annual temperature and precipitation conditions at La Selva by the equation of Brown and Lugo (1982)] and unpublished data on root production (550-1,250 g\/m2\/year), giving a NPP range of about 1,400-2,100 g\/m2\/year.Revision Notes: The NPP data file has been revised to add additional root biomass estimates, correct temporal coverage of data series, correct parameter label for potassium concentration in leaf litterfall, and add additional References\/Comments. Please see the Data Set Revisions section of this document for detailed information.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
