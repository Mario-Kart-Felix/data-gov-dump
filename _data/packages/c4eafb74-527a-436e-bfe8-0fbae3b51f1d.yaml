    to produce high strength, high stiffness, and high temperature composite parts.
     To address these issues, new processes to lower cost for high temperature composite
    manufacturing need to be explored.  An obstacle for high temperature processing
    of composites is the creation of by-products or volatiles during cure.  An innovative
    technology, Double Bag Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (DBARTM), has been developed
    by Dr. Tan Hou at NASA Langley that deals with this obstacle.  The technology has
    only been developed for phenolic resins which is a lower temperature curing resin
    than is required for many high temperature composite component applications.rnThis
    process has been shown to reduce the amount of volatiles trapped in the laminates.
     The key is innovative volatile control during the DBARTM fabrication process.
     The process results in low-void to void-free quality laminates and fulfils a critically
    needed technology gap that will enable insertion of an important class of high performance
    materials into commercial, military and aerospace market places at an accelerated
    pace. rnThe primary technical objective of the proposed work is to show the feasibility
    of the use of the NASA DBARTM technology for high temperature polyimides composite
    manufacturing.  In Phase I, work will focus on material selection, process development,
    and fabrication and test of flat panels of both phenolic and polyimides.  At the
    end of Phase I, the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is expected to be 2-3.  In
    Phase II, the DBARTM process will be used with a polyimide resin system to fabricate
    a full-scale prototype of the initial application.rn",nt"license_title": "U.S.

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
