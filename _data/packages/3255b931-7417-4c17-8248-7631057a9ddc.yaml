    for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not
    further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this
    data set may be limited.nnThis data set contains radar soil moisture measurements
    taken over the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03) regional study areas in Oklahoma,
    USA. The Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) instrument was mounted on a
    DC-8 aircraft that flew over the area six days during the study period, between
    3 July and 12 July 2003. Six different scenes were collected over the Oklahoma South
    (OS) study area per flight day. Four flight lines were eastbound and covered the
    Little Washita (LW) watershed at incidence angles between approximately 35 and 45
    degrees. The other two scenes were acquired in a northbound orientation and covered
    a large part of the regional study area at incidence angles between approximately
    20 and 70 degrees. During the flight days over the Oklahoma North (ON) study area,
    two northbound lines were flown. These flight lines cover the full study area at
    incidence angle between 20 and 70 degrees. Total volume for this data set is approximately
    26 GB. Data are provided in binary files, annotated JPEG files, and ASCII text files.
    All files are available via FTP. nnThese data were collected as part of a validation
    study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E).
    AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002.
    AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of
    AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and
    refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation
    accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography,
    and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are
    useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
