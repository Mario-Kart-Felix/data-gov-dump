  national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile
  is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to
  cover the entire nation.nSchool Districts are single-purpose administrative units
  within which local officials provide public educational services for the area's
  residents.  The Census Bureau obtains the boundaries, names, local education agency
  codes, grade ranges, and school district levels for school districts from State
  officials for the primary purpose of providing the U.S. Department of Education
  with estimates of the number of children in poverty within each school district.
  \ This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to determine
  the annual allocation of Title I funding to States and school districts.nTIGER/Line
  Shapefiles include separate shapefiles for elementary, secondary and unified school
  districts.  The school district boundaries are those in effect for the 2011-2012
