    in Vermont, covering approximately 1,604 square miles. Dataset Description: The
    Rutland, VT LiDAR project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative
    products of LIDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters.
    Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial
    Program Base LIDAR Specification, Version 1. The data was developed based on a horizontal
    projection/datum of Vermont State Plane coordinate System (FIPS 4400), NAD83, meters
    and vertical datum of NAVD1988 (GEOID12A), meters. LiDAR data was delivered in RAW
    flight line swath format. This data was also processed to create 2,399 individual
    1,400 meter x 1,400 meter tiled Classified LAS 1.2 Files. Hydro-flattened/hydro-enforced
    breaklines were produced in Esri Shapefile format. 0.7-meter gridded hydro-flattened
    raster DEM Files were produced in ERDAS .IMG format, and 0.7-meter hydro-enforced
    DEMs were produced in Esri Grid format; both were tiled to the same 1,400 meter
    x 1,400 meter tile layout. Additionally 1-foot contours were produced in Esri shapefile
    format and tiled Intensity Images were produced in GeoTIFF format. Ground Conditions:
    LiDAR collection began in November 2013 while no snow was on the ground and rivers
    were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet
    task order specifications, Quantum Spatial established a total of 98 ground control
    points and 100 QC points that were used to calibrate the LIDAR to known ground locations
    established throughout the Rutland, Vermont project area.",nt"license_title":
