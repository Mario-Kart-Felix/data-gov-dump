	"notes": "Advanced robotic systems demand an enhanced vision system and image processing algorithms to reduce the percentage of manual operation required. Unstructured environments, whether man-mad (e.g., International Space Station) or natural (e.g., Mars), present significant challenges to supervised autonomy or fully autonomous systems &amp;#150; advanced perception sensors and associated software are required.  This will be particularly important both for future long duration exploration missions where the transmit (Tx) / receive (Rx) delay will be substantial and a high degree of autonomy will be required to maximize science gain, as well as for telerobotic systems where a human operator is IVA and advanced operations in a short timeline are desired. No solution currently exists for small robotic platforms.  Honeybee Robotics proposes to develop a compact, wide-angle, Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system that is able to detect dynamic changes in the field of view (FOV) and focus the laser scan pattern centered on the area of interest while maintaining a lower-resolution fixed FOV for robotic path planning, navigation, inspection, and identification tasks.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
