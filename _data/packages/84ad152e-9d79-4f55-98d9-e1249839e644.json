This network accommodates a land use pattern that focuses new growth along fixed transit corridors, links urban, city, and town centers, provides evacuation alternatives, and acts as a first line of defense against future storms. The network represents a balanced transportation network with investment in both roadways and transit. The routes are based on data from the Louisiana State Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) Statewide Transportation Plan, projects from local Metropolitan Planning Organization Master Transportation Plans (MTP), the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) Master Plan, and input from Louisiana Speaks Regional Plan workshops. The Louisiana Speaks Regional Plan process study area includes the 35 southernmost parishes of Louisiana.",
