	"notes": "NASA spends considerable effort supporting the efforts of collaborating researchers.  These researchers are interested in interacting with scientific models provided by NASA and they are located throughout the world.  The process of distributing legacy research codes to this disparate group of researches and assisting them with the compilation of these codes is time consuming and there for costly.  The proposed innovation would allow users to interact with these models using a modern, familiar web-based application interface.  Functionality such as the editing of input conditions, interaction with supercomputing queues, monitoring of code progress, and accessing of results would all be provided through web services.  The web application would interact with these web services based on user input from a variety of controls.  The architecture is based on the paradigm of Software as a Service and similar to technologies underlying state of the art web applications such as Google Maps.  As such it represents a huge advancement from the traditional approach of distributing legacy codes and dealing with compilation issues with varying hardware and operating systems.rnrn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
