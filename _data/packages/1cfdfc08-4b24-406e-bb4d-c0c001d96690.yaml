  acoustic-backscatter map of Offshore of Pacifica map area, California. Backscatter
  data are provided as two separate grids depending on mapping system. The raster
  data files are included in \"Backscatter7125_OffshorePacifica.zip,\" which is accessible
  from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshorePacifica/data_catalog_OffshorePacifica.html.
  The acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of Pacifica, California was generated
  from backscatter data collected by Fugro Pelagos and by California State University,
  Monterey Bay (CSUMB). Mapping was completed between 2005 and 2007, using a combination
  of 400-kHz Reson 7125 and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounders. Within the
  final imagery, brighter tones indicate higher backscatter intensity, and darker
  tones indicate lower backscatter intensity. The intensity represents a complex interaction
  between the acoustic pulse and the seafloor, as well as characteristics within the
  shallow subsurface, providing a general indication of seafloor texture and composition.
  Backscatter intensity depends on the acoustic source level; the frequency used to
  image the seafloor; the grazing angle; the composition and character of the seafloor,
  including grain size, water content, bulk density, and seafloor roughness; and some
  biological cover. Harder and rougher bottom types such as rocky outcrops or coarse
  sediment typically return stronger intensities (high backscatter, lighter tones),
  whereas softer bottom types such as fine sediment return weaker intensities (low
  backscatter, darker tones).\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\":
