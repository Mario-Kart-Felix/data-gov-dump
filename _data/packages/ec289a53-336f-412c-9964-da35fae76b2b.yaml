    low power, Next-Generation Exercise Device (NGRED) that can generate any force between
    5 and 600 lbf. We use a closed loop control system and a servo motor to smoothly
    and accurately simulate the gravitational and inertial loads of lifting a weight
    on earth. However, because the system uses a computer-controlled motor, the load
    can be varied independently during the concentric and eccentric phase of the exercise.
    Thus, the system can easily provide an eccentric overload during the return stroke,
    greatly increasing the physiological benefit of a workout. rnrnThe NGRED has a user-friendly
    interface where the exercise is selected from a drop-down menu, along with the desired
    weight and overload. The NGRED will automatically adjust to the user's stored range
    of motion (ROM) for the selected exercise and apply the set load only during the
    ROM. The NGRED automatically applies the eccentric overload at the top of the ROM
    and advances to the next rep at the bottom. The time required to change between
    users, exercises, and weights is less than 10 seconds. This makes much better use
    of the astronaut's time; with current mechanically adjustable exercise machines
    up to two thirds of the time is spent adjusting the machine. The software includes
    data logging and communication abilities to meet NASA requirements as well as redundant
    hardware and software fail-safe mechanisms.rnrnThe NGRED includes an efficient energy
    recovery system which stores the energy generated by the user during the concentric
    phase of the motion (pull stroke) and applies that energy to provide resistance
    during the eccentric phase (return stroke). The average power consumption of the
    NGRED will be less than 50 W during an exercise session. The expected weight of
    the NGRED at the end of Phase II will be 20 kg, and the total volume is expected
    to be 55 L, including all electronics and controls. A flight-like NGRED will be
    delivered to NASA at the end of Phase II.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
