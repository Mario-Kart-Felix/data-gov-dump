  for the geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore of Salt Point map area, California.
  The vector data file is included in \"Folds_OffshoreSaltPoint.zip,\" which is accessible
  from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreSaltPoint/data_catalog_OffshoreSaltPoint.html.
  The onshore part of the Offshore of Salt Point map area is cut by the northwest-trending
  San Andreas Fault, the right-lateral transform boundary between the North American
  and Pacific tectonic plates. The San Andreas extends extends into the offshore about
  5 km south of the map area near Fort Ross, and about 50 km north of the map area
  on the east flank of Point Arena. The coast between Fort Ross and Point Arena, the
  northwesternmost exposed section west of the San Andreas Fault, is known as the
  \"Gualala Block\" (fig. 1) on the basis of its distinctive geology, which has been
  widely used to develop paleogeographic reconstructions of coastal California that
  restore as much as 150 to 180 km of right-lateral slip on the combined San Andreas
  and San Gregorio Fault systems (see, for example, Wentworth, (1968); Wentworth and
  others (1998); Jachens and others (1998); Dickinson and others (2005); Burnham (2009).
  The Gualala Block is underlain by a thick (as much as 9 to 11 km, in aggregate),
  discontinuous Upper Cretaceous to Miocene stratigraphic section (summarized in Wentworth
  and others, 1998), however only the Eocene and Paleocene German Rancho Formation
  (unit Tgr) is exposed onshore and is inferred to form seafloor bedrock outcrops
  in the Offshore of Salt Point map area. The German Rancho Formation consists of
  sandstone, mudstone, and conglomerate interpreted as deep-water, submarine-fan deposits.
  The western boundary of the Gualala Block lies offshore. Using seismic-reflection
  data, McCulloch (1987; his fig. 14) mapped a shore-parallel fault about 3 to 5 km
  offshore, which Dickinson and others (2005) subsequently named the Gualala Fault.
  Jachens and others (1998) evaluated aeromagnetic and gravity data across this zone
  and modeled this structure as a steep fault within the Salinian basement block,
  characterized by 3 to 5 km of right-lateral offset. In contrast, Dickinson and others
  (2005) consider the Gualala fault a Late Miocene strand of the San Andreas fault,
  separating Salinian and Franciscan basement rocks, with minimum right-lateral slip
  of 70 km. Our analysis of deeper industry seismic-reflection data within California
  State Waters shows the Gualala fault as a steep, northeast-dipping structure. Shallower
  seismic-reflection crossing the Gualala fault reveal a thick late(?) Pleistocene
  section characterized by recent faulting and gentle asymmetric folding. Hence, the
  Gualala fault appears to be a recently active \"blind\" structure that has deformed
  young sediments. Our mapping also documents a more nearshore zone of deformation
  that we refer to as the \"east Gualala deformation zone.\" This zone extends through
  the central and southern parts of the Offshore of Salt Point map area and is similarly
  charcterized by steep faults and gentle folds that deform inferred late Pleistocene
  strata. This section of the San Andreas Fault onland has an estimated slip rate
  of about 17 to 25 mm/yr (Bryant and Lundberg, 2002). The devastating Great 1906
  California earthquake (M 7.8) is thought to have nucleated on the San Andreas Fault
  about 100 kilometers south of this map area offshore of San Francisco (e.g., Bolt,
  1968; Lomax, 2005), with the rupture extending northward through the onshore part
  of the Offshore of Salt Point map area to the south flank of Cape Mendocino (Lawson,
  1908; Brown and Wolfe, 1972). Emergent marine terraces along the coast in the Offshore
  of Salt Point map area record recent contractional deformation associated with the
  San Andreas Fault system. Prentice and Kelson (2006) reported uplift rates of 0.3
  to 0.6 mm/yr for a nearby late Pleistocene terrace (exposed at Fort Ross, about
  5 km south of the map area) and this recent uplift must also have affected the nearshore
  and inner shelf, at least as far west as the Gualala fault. Folds were primarily
  mapped by interpretation of seismic reflection profile data (see field activity
  S-8-09-NC). The seismic reflection profiles were collected between 2007 and 2010.
