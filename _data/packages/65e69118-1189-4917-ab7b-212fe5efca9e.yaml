  Inductive Monitoring System (IMS) is a tool that uses a data mining technique called
  clustering to extract models of normal system operation from archived data. IMS
  works with vectors of data values. IMS analyzes data collected during periods of
  normal system operation to build a system model. It characterizes how the parameters
  relate to one another during normal operation by finding areas in the vector space
  where nominal data tends to fall. These areas are called nominal operating regions
  and correspond to clusters of similar points found by the IMS clustering algorithm.
  These nominal operating regions are stored in a knowledge base that IMS uses for
  real-time telemetry monitoring or archived data analysis.  rnrnDuring the monitoring
  operation, IMS reads real-time or archived data values, formats them into the predefined
  vector structure, and searches the knowledge base of nominal operating regions to
  see how well the new data fits the nominal system characterization. For each input
  vector, IMS returns the distance that vector falls from the nearest nominal operating
  region. Data that matches the normal training data well will have a deviation distance
  of zero. If one or more of the data parameters is slightly outside of expected values,
  a small non-zero result is returned. As incoming data deviates further from the
  normal system data, indicating a possible malfunction, IMS will return a higher
  deviation value to alert users of the anomaly. IMS also calculates the contribution
  of each individual parameter to the overall deviation, which can help isolate the
  cause of the anomaly. \",\n\t\"license_title\": \"U.S. Government Work\",\n\t\"extras\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
