    potential for the state of Arizona at a 50 meter height. This dataset will be replaced
    when the southwest region has been completed, and the data may change when this
    region has been completed.rnrn_Purpose:_  Provide information on the wind resource
    development potential within the state of Arizona.rnrn_Supplemental Information:_
     This data set has been validated by NREL and wind energy meteorological consultants.
    However, the data is not suitable for micro-siting potential development projects.
    This shapefile was generated from a raster dataset with a 200 m resolution, in a
    UTM zone 12, datum WGS 84 projection system.rnrnOther Citation Details:  The wind
    power resource estimates were produced by AWS TrueWind using their MesoMap system
    and historical weather data under contract to Wind Powering America/NREL. This map
    has been validated with available surface data by NREL and wind energy meteorological
    consultants.rnrn### License InfornDISCLAIMER NOTICErnThis GIS data was developed
