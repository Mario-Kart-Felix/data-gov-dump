	"notes": "The STTR Phase I proposal aims to develop innovative device concepts andnfabrication techniques that enable the construction of high-performancenuncooled long-wave infrared (LWIR, 8-12?Ym) photodetectors. LWIRnphotodetectors are of great importance in real-time acquisition ofnradiation characteristics of the Earth and its environments fornunderstanding and predicting the Earth's climate and potential hazards.nQuantum dot infrared photodetector (QDIP) technology offers an excellentnchoice for LWIR sensing due to its superior performance, including highntemporal resolution (&amp;lt;1 ?Ys) and low noise equivalent temperaturendifference (NETD &amp;lt;10mK). However, existing QDIP technology requiresncryogenic cooling to reduce dark current, which substantially increasesnsize, weight and power consumption. Because of this, the proposednresearch aims to develop innovative device concepts and fabricationntechniques that can substantially reduce dark current, thus allow thenconstruction of uncooled QDIPs. The uncooled QDIP technology enablesnhigh-performance LWIR detecting on a chip with significantly reducednpayload. It is highly desired in many Earth science applications. ThenPhase I work will perform feasibility investigation of the proposedndevice concept, optimize quantum dots growth and annealing techniquesnand produce a preliminary design for a prototype system that can benbuilt and demonstrated in Phase II with a NASA supplied platform.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
