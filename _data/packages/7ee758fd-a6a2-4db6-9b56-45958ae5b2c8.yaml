    related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic
    information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated
    Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents
    a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line
    File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined
    to cover the entire nation. States and equivalent entities are the primary governmental
    divisions of the United States. In addition to the fifty States, the Census Bureau
    treats the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and each of the Island Areas (American
    Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin
    Islands) as the statistical equivalents of States for the purpose of data presentation.<br
    /><br /> This table contains housing data, including building age, value and/or
    rent, length of occupation, number of units, home heating type, and number of vehicles
    from the American Community Survey 2006-2010 database for states. The American Community
    Survey (ACS) is a household survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that currently
    has an annual sample size of about 3.5 million addresses. ACS estimates provides
    communities with the current information they need to plan investments and services.
    Information from the survey generates estimates that help determine how more than
    $400 billion in federal and state funds are distributed annually. Each year the
    survey produces data that cover the periods of 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year estimates
    for geographic areas in the United States and Puerto Rico, ranging from neighborhoods
    to Congressional districts to the entire nation. This table also has a companion
    table (Same table name with MOE Suffix) with the margin of error (MOE) values for
    each estimated element. MOE is expressed as a measure value for each estimated element.
    So a value of 25 and an MOE of 5 means 25 +/- 5 (or statistical certainty between
    20 and 30). There are also special cases of MOE. An MOE of -1 means the associated
    estimates do not have a measured error. An MOE of 0 means that error calculation
    is not appropriate for the associated value. An MOE of 109 is set whenever an estimate
    value is 0. The MOEs of aggregated elements and percentages must be calculated.
    This process means using standard error calculations as described in "American
    Community Survey Multiyear Accuracy of the Data (3-year 2008-2010 and 5-year 2006-2010)".
    Also, following Census guidelines, aggregated MOEs do not use more than 1 0-element
    MOE (109) to prevent over estimation of the error. Due to the complexity of the
    calculations, some percentage MOEs cannot be calculated (these are set to null in
    the summary-level MOE tables).",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
