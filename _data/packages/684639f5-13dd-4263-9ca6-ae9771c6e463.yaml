  backscatter mosaic of the bathymetry of a reef shelf/bank and the steep slopes and
  canyons of the NE Reserve, offshore of Fajardo, Puerto Rico. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA
  Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory,
  federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the
  Northeast Reserve during 2012 and 2013. Data was acquired with a moon pool mounted
  Reson 7125 multibeam echosounder (400 kHz). Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum
  NAD83. The backscatter component of the bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically
  corrected using .HSX and .7k file pairs that were converted to GSF format in Hypack
  2012, then processed in Fledermaus Geocoder Toolbox 7.3.3c. Acoustic backscatter
  mosaics are an important piece of information when characterizing surficial seafloor
  features and delineating benthic habitats. The project was conducted to meet IHO
  Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users
  should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own
  needs and standards.\",\n\t\"license_title\": null,\n\t\"extras\": [{\n\t\t\"key\":
