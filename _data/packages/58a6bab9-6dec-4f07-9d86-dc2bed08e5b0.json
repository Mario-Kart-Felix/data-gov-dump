	"notes": "Speaking to the cockpit as a method of system management in flight can become an effective interaction method, since voice communication is very efficient. Automated Speech Recognition in general, and aided and abetted now by Southern Air Aviation's Voice Activated Cockpit Management Systems including the innovative heuristic technology Voice-Flight NexGen (VFNG) has advanced significantly in recent years and is now ideally suited to this application.  VFNG is speaker-independent, achieves a word recognition rate of 98&#37; in high noise and up to 120Db, and permits the chaining of up to four commands in a single utterance and a correction of a misspoken command in the same utterance.  All of these performance requirements are met within a 2&#37; time-slice of a 1.2GHz Power PC processor and within 1 GB of memory.  VFNG includes the following unique key capabilities, Grammar Development, Dictionary Development, Automated Batch Grammar Testing, Grammar Coverage Query, Phonetic Distance Analysis, and Co&amp;#8208;articulation Handling, Command Based Confidence Algorithm, Accent Tolerability Handling, State Based Dynamic Grammar, and Clipped Audio Recovery Processing.  VFNG incorporates proprietary Julius based grammar and vocabulary of advanced performance and reduced recognition error together with an acoustic model derived from the VoxForge acoustic model.  The VFNG-Emergency Failures (VFNG-E) system is used as the sole human/machine interface in flight in real emergency situations, in addition to the system having applications for simulator and ground training. This training system is remarkable in that it achieves very high recognition rates (98&#37;) with a very large command set (131,000 unique words and thousands of word combinations) in challenging environmental conditions and operator profiles providing much added safety and efficiency to the pilot in the cockpit.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
