    The four datasets that predict the probability of elevated concentrations of nitrate
    are differentiated by whether or not they incorporated fertilizer use and whether
    or not they incorporated hydrogeomorphic regions. Each of the eight datasets has
    its own unique strengths and weaknesses. The user is cautioned to read Rupert (2003,
    Probability of detecting atrazine/desethyl-atrazine and elevated concentrations
    of nitrate in ground water in Colorado: U.S. Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations
    Report 02-4269, 35 p., http://water.usgs.gov/pubs/wri/wri02-4269/) to determine
    if he(she) is using the most appropriate dataset for his(her) particular needs.
    This dataset specifically predicts the probability of detecting elevated concentrations
    of nitrate in ground water in Colorado with hydrogeomorphic regions not included
    and fertilizer use included. The following text was extracted from Rupert (2003).
    Draft Federal regulations may require that each State develop a State Pesticide
    Management Plan for the herbicides atrazine, alachlor, metolachlor, and simazine.
    Maps were developed that the State of Colorado could use to predict the probability
    of detecting atrazine/DEA in ground water in Colorado. These maps can be incorporated
    into the State Pesticide Management Plan and can help provide a sound hydrogeologic
    basis for atrazine management in Colorado. Maps showing the probability of detecting
    elevated nitrite plus nitrate as nitrogen (nitrate) concentrations in ground water
    in Colorado also were developed because nitrate is a contaminant of concern in many
    areas of Colorado. Maps showing the probability of detecting atrazine/DEA at or
    greater than concentrations of 0.1 microgram per liter and nitrate concentrations
    in ground water greater than 5 milligrams per liter were developed as follows: (1)
    Ground-water quality data were overlaid with anthropogenic and hydrogeologic data
    by using a geographic information system (GIS) to produce a dataset in which each
    well had corresponding data on atrazine use, fertilizer use, geology, hydrogeomorphic
    regions, land cover, precipitation, soils, and well construction. These data then
    were downloaded to a statistical software package for analysis by logistic regression.
    (2) Relations were observed between ground-water quality and the percentage of land-cover
    categories within circular regions (buffers) around wells. Several buffer sizes
    were evaluated; the buffer size that provided the strongest relation was selected
    for use in the logistic regression models. (3) Relations between concentrations
    of atrazine/DEA and nitrate in ground water and atrazine use, fertilizer use, geology,
    hydrogeomorphic regions, land cover, precipitation, soils, and well-construction
    data were evaluated, and several preliminary multivariate models with various combinations
    of independent variables were constructed. (4) The multivariate models that best
    predicted the presence of atrazine/DEA and elevated concentrations of nitrate in
    ground water were selected. (5) The accuracy of the multivariate models was confirmed
    by validating the models with an independent set of ground-water quality data. (6)
    The multivariate models were entered into a geographic information system and the
    probability GRIDS were constructed.",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras":

    "["Use Constraints: This dataset should not be used at a scale any larger than
    1:250,000, which is the scale of the soils data used to construct the probability
    GRIDS. Soils data at a larger scale were not available for all regions of Colorado.
    This dataset is one of eight datasets produced by this study. The user is cautioned
    to read Rupert (2003) to ensure that they are using the correct dataset for their
    particular needs. The probability GRIDS developed by this study are designed to
    portray the potential for contamination of ground water in Colorado. These GRIDS
    do not show areas that are actually (currently) contaminated; rather, these GRIDS
    show the areas that have a potential (or likelihood) for being contaminated if a
    contaminant was released to the environment. More specifically, each GRID shows
    the probability of detection (in terms of a percent) of a particular chemical compound
    (the contaminant) in ground water. Probability is not the same as certainty; a well
    in a high probability area is not necessarily contaminated because contamination
    also can depend on well depth and other local factors not taken into account by
    the models used to produce these probability GRIDS. The atrazine/DEA and nitrate
    probability GRIDS were specifically developed for use by the State of Colorado in
    its Pesticide Management Plan to help provide a sound hydrogeologic basis for the
    management of atrazine and nitrogen in Colorado. The GRIDS are intended to be a
    first approximation at developing a consistent rating method for the entire State.
    Additional site-specific data are needed before site-specific decisions are made,
    such as pesticide-use restrictions. The most appropriate uses of these GRIDS are
    to focus prevention programs in areas of greatest concern, to focus ground-water
    sampling programs in areas of greatest potential for contamination, and to assist
    educational programs for ground-water quality protection. The accuracy of the probability
    GRIDS would be improved if (1) larger scale soils data were available in digital
    form, (2) more complete and detailed chemical-use data were available, and (3) a
    larger number and wider distribution of ground-water quality data, particularly
    in rangeland areas, were available. Data differentiating between sprinkler and flood
    irrigation methods would probably improve the accuracy in agricultural areas. Some
    site-specific variables, such as improper well construction and local spills of
    contaminants, were not accounted for in the models. Accounting for ground-water
    flow direction was beyond the scope of this study. Depth to ground water was not
    evaluated by this study because a large-scale statewide coverage was not available.
    Depth to ground water may be an important coverage to develop for future studies.",
