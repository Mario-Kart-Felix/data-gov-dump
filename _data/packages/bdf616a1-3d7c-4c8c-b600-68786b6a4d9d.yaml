    to Development, Urbanization and Recreation The intent of this issue is to: o Identify
    the areas at greatest risk of conversion from forestland to other uses-specifically
    development. o Identify those areas were pressure from off highway vehicle (OHV)
    use in undesignated areas can lead to degradation of forested areas. This layer
    was constructed using the following layers: 1. Development Potential The National
    Guidance suggested using the "Forests on the Edge" data developed by Dr. David
    Theobold, Colorado State University. These data use the SERGoM v3 model, described
    in the research paper Watersheds at Risk to Increased Impervious Surface Cover in
    the Conterminous United States, to predict housing density in ten-year increments
    from 2000 to 2030. By subtracting 2000 housing densities from 2030 predicted housing
    densities, we can express the potential areas of new development. The Theobold data
    broke out housing density into ten classes; we modified these to eight classes as
    follows: 1. No Development or >80 acres per unit (rural) 2. 40-80 acres per unit
    (rural 1) 3. 20-40 acres per unit (rural 1) 4. 10-20 acres per unit (rural 2) 5.
    1.7-10 acres per unit (rural 2) 6. 0.6-1.7 acres per unit (exurban/urban) 7. <0.6
    acres per unit (exurban/urban) 8. Urban/built up (commercial, industrial, transportation)
    When considering the movement from one density class to another, we wanted to make
    some judgment about the relative impact of that change. IDL Staff developed the
    following matrix showing values from 0 (no change) and 1 (low impact change) to
    5 (highest impact change) and classified the data accordingly. The numbers in the
    colored boxes represent the housing density classes shown above. So, movement from
    density class 2 (one unit per 40 - 80 acres) in 2000 to density class 4 (10-20 acres
    per unit) by 2030 is considered a very high impact (value of five), A movement from
    density class 2 (one unit per 40 - 80 acres) in 2000 to density class 3 (one unit
    per 20-40) acres in 2030, on the other hand, is considered a high change (value
    of 4). 2030 No_Dev1 / Rural2 / Rural3 / Rural4 / Urban5 / Urban6 / Urban7 / Urban8

    -- -- Table Key -- = no or negative change 1 = low impact change 2 = low-moderate
    impact change 3 = moderate impact change 4 = high-moderate impact change 5 = high
    impact change 2. Recreation Pressure from ORV's We used a model developed by the
    Idaho Department of Lands that incorporated US Census data for population density,
    the number of ORV registrations by county, TIGER 2000-based streets dataset, and
    travel distance preferences from 2002 Recreation Demand Assessment by the Idaho
    Department of Parks and Recreation. We used the following assumptions in developing
    the model: o Census population can be used as a surrogate for overall recreation
    pressure o OHV registration totals by county can be used to estimate motorized recreation
    pressure o The public road network is how recreation pressure is transmitted and
    dispersed to forested lands o Recreation pressure comes primarily from urban population
    centers within and outside the state: 1. Boise/Nampa/Caldwell 2. Twin Falls 3. Pocatello
    4. Ogden/Layton, UT 5. Logan, UT 6. Idaho Falls 7. Moscow, ID/Pullman, WA 8. Clarkston,
    WA/Lewiston, ID 9. Spokane, WA/Coeur d'Alene, ID o Recreation pressure on a forestland
    can come from multiple population centers and is additive o Recreation pressure
    decreases as travel time to a recreation destination increases (actually, not an
    assumption but confirmed by IDPR recreation demand surveys) o All parts of the state
    are equally desirable recreation destinations and certain destinations (such as
    resort areas, parks, etc.) do not attract more recreation pressure than others o
    Recreation activity is defined as that which lasts a day or less; multi-day recreation
    activities are not considered The result is a map that shows ORV pressure based
    on a 1 to 3 hour travel time. Those areas closest to urban areas (requiring less
    time to get to) were scored highest. Data was divided into three classes, scored
    1 through 3. More information on this model can be found by reading the Modeling
    Recreation Pressure on Idaho Forest Lands. Issue Process: The two datasets were
    added together, and then stratified into 5 classes (low to high risk) using natural
    breaks in the data. Idaho Statewide Assessment of Forest Resources document contains
    additional information and can be found at: http://www.idl.idaho.gov/bureau/ForestAssist/safr/final/061410-ID-SAFR-FINAL.pdf.",nt"license_title":
