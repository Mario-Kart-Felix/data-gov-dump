	"notes": "# SummaryrnrnThere is a major thrust worldwide on developing affordable Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) technologies in aerospace, automotive and other areas. The fundamental objective is to enhance availability, increase safety and reduce unscheduled maintenance costs. IVHM enables fault detection, isolation, root cause analysis and potential diagnostics. In addition, it aims at developing robust algorithms to predict the onset of a fault, minimizing false alarms and estimating the remaining useful life of the mission despite the adversity. IVHM optimally integrates technologies in sensors, vehicle systems, prognostics and diagnostics.rnrnNASA and CSIR-NAL have received an award to jointly organize the first Indo-US Workshop on IVHM and Aviation Safety (WIAS), sponsored by Indo-US Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) from Jan. 5th to 7th, 2012 in Bangalore, which is the aerospace hub of the country. rnrn# PurposernThe purpose of the workshop is to deliberate, discuss and evolve the state of the art aerospace systemsu2019 health management strategies, and identify opportunities for collaboration between US & Indian Institutions. This will help orchestrate preparation of IVHM roadmap into the future. This is an attempt, initiated at NAL, in the direction of creating an ecosystem among R&D, Academics and Industry on the subject matter as a part of the IVHM Mission for aerospace industry. We thus see unprecedented opportunities for discussions and knowledge networking in the areas of IVHM.rnrn# ParticipationrnAn active participation from following organizations / agencies is expected:rnrnLeading US academic institutions including Stanford, Berkley, Georgia Tech and Auburn UniversityrnUS Industry including GM, GE, Honeywell, Boeing Research, Lockheed Martin, Rockwell CollinsrnrnEuropean organizations such as the Center of Excellence, Cranfield, UK; LMS International, Belgium; Airbus & Dassault systems, FrancernTop Indian Academia like IITs & IISc, R&D (like DRDO, CSIR, DST, DOS), Industry, Regulatory (DGCA) and Armed Forces.rnrnThe IVHM program envisages close cooperation of R&D, Academia and Industry (national and international) and has immediate applications to legacy, current and future generation aircraft and other programs.rnrn# Expected outcome     rnrn<ul>rnrn<li>  Collaborations on development of IVHM methodologies, architectures, diagnostics and prognostics algorithms, modeling and simulation.rnrn<li>  Close cooperation among  US & Indian academic institutions  and research centers Collaborations on crucial topics in IVHM thus complementing each otheru2019s resourcesrnrn<li>  Roadmap of IVHM in the Indian and global context involving Indian counterparts from academic, R&D and Industrial institutionsrnrn<li>  Initiating right IVHM concepts in the design of NextGen civil aircraft.rn</ul> rnrnrn#  Principal Investigatorsrnrnrn**India** Dr Satish Chandra, PD, NCAD & HoD, Structures Division, National Aerospace laboratories, Bangalorernrn**USA**  Dr Ashok N.

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
