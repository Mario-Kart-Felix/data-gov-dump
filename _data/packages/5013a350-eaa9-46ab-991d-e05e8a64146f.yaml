  in collaboration with other state and federal agencies, industry, and academia,
  is conducting a National Geochemical Survey (NGS) to produce a database of geochemical
  information for the United States based primarily on stream sediments, analyzed
  using a single set of methods. This data set will comprise a national-scale geochemical
  coverage of the US, and will enable construction of geochemical maps, refine estimates
  of baseline chemical element concentrations in the sampled media, and provide context
  for a wide variety of geological and environmental studies. The goal of the NGS
  is to analyze at least one stream-sediment sample within every 289 km2 area across
  the US, using a consistent set of analytical methods, substituting soil samples
  where necessary. The survey incorporates geochemical data from a variety of sources,
  including existing analyses in USGS databases, reanalyses of samples in USGS archives,
  and analyses of recently collected samples. Currently, the NGS data covers ~71%
  of the land area of the US, and includes samples from all 50 states. The Iowa Geological
  Survey (IGS) of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) entered into an
  agreement with the USGS in September of 2002 whereby the IGS would design a database
  for field parameters and collect two soil sample sets. One set for the USGS to process
  and analyze, and one set to reposit. Field parameters included ambient site conditions,
  GPS location, elevation, landscape position, vegetation type, NRCS soil type, sample
  depth, and soil horizon, texture, color and moisture. Digital photographs were taken
  of the site and samples at each location. The samples were sieved to -100 mesh,
  then analyzed for 40 elements using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry/acid
  dissolution (ICP40), and 6 elements using atomic absorption spectrometry (AA). Arsenic
  (As) and gold (Au) were analyzed for using both methods. Analyses were performed
  by the USGS or an approved laboratory, using standard methods and an U.S.E.P.A.
  approved quality assurance/quality control plan. To maximize statistical reliability,
  sample collection in Iowa was based on a 17 km x 17 km grid, displayed on USGS 1:250,000
  quad maps. Each grid or cell was identified by quad name and cell column and row
  position, and divided into four 72 km2 quadrants, and one was selected at random
  for sampling. The IGS selected specific sampling sites within the selected quadrants.
  To separate leached horizons from those accumulating CO3, one shallow (0-8 inches)
  and one deep (12-24 inches) sample were collected from 463 regular and 72 analysis
  of variance (AOV) sites from May through August of 2003 and shipped to the USGS
  in August. Randomly selected AOV sites were sampled to provide a data set for statistical
  analysis to test the adequacy of the samples to measure differences of sediment
  chemistry between cells, within cells, within sites, and between chemical analyses.
  \"AOV1\" was collected within the designated quadrant of the cell, then one of the
  three other quadrants of the cell were selected at random for \"AOV2\" and \"AOV3\"
  which were collected about 10 feet apart, preferably within the same soil type.
  The field data were described on data collection sheets and later transferred to
  the IGS network through an entry routine on a daily to weekly basis. The DBASE entry
  routine and database were developed and maintained by IGS personnel, then after
  the analyses were performed, the data were joined with the soil sample analyses
  by USGS personnel. The joined database can be accessed at the IGS website at http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu,
  and for a detailed description of the NGS, visit the USGS website at http://tin.er.usgs.gov/geochem/doc/home.htm\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  accurate analyses. Samples can easily be contaminated with Hg during handling, storage,
  and preparation for analysis. Mercury can also be lost from samples during the drying
  process or while in storage. Recently collected samples were handled and stored
  in a manner that should result in few such problems. However, many Hg data in the
  NGS are based on reanalyses of archival samples, e.g., NURE samples, that were neither
  collected using protocols appropriate for Hg analysis, nor stored under conditions
  that would necessarily preserve the original Hg concentrations. Some NURE samples
  in the eastern US were very likely contaminated by Hg at some point after collection
  (e.g., all samples from Allegany County, Maryland). At the present time, it is not
  known which archival samples may have been contaminated with Hg in the laboratory,
