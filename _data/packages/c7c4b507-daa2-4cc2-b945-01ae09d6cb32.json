	"notes": "The Phase I project successfully demonstrated that the advanced non-contacting stress measurement system (NSMS) was able to address closely spaced modes and blade-to-blade variations (mistuning).  MSI's advanced NSMS method uses a radar-based blade vibration measurement system with the following capabilities:rn?tProvides a continuous time series of blade displacement data over a portion of a revolution (solving the under sampling problem). rn?tIncludes data reduction algorithms to directly calculate the blade vibration frequency, modal displacement, and vibratory stress (solving the mode inference problem). rn?tUses a single sensor per stage to monitor all of the blades on the stage.rnThe Phase II work begins by confirming the sensor calibration process, modifying the sensor module so it is compatible as an upgrade to existing NSMS system, and improving and finalizing the NSMS software.  The result will be a stand-alone radar/tip timing radar module for current conventional NSMS users (as an upgrade) and new users.  The hybrid system will use frequency data and relative mode vibration levels from the radar sensor to provide substantially superior capabilities over current blade vibration technology.  This frequency data, coupled with a reduced number of tip timing probes, will result in a system capable of detecting complex blade vibrations which would confound traditional NSMS systems.  The hardware and software package will be validated on an existing compressor rig at MSI.  Finally, the hybrid radar/tip timing NSMS software package and associated sensor hardware will be installed for use in the NASA GRC spin pit test facility.  MSI will also supply the stand-alone radar module to a major engine prime.rn",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
