    true,nt"url": null,nt"notes": "With the advent of the next generation of
    aerospace systems equipped with fly-by-wire controls, electro- mechanical actuators
    (EMA) are quickly becoming components critical to safety of aerospace vehicles.
    Being relatively new to the field, however, EMA lack the knowledge base compared
    to what is accumulated for the more traditional actuator types, especially when
    it comes to fault detection and prognosis. Scarcity of health monitoring data from
    fielded systems and prohibitive costs of carrying out real flight tests create the
    need to build high-fidelity system models and design affordable yet realistic experimental
    setups. The objective of this work is to build an EMA test stand that, unlike current
    laboratory stands typically weighing in excess of one metric ton, is portable enough
    to be easily placed aboard a wide variety of aircraft. This stand, named the FLEA
    (for Flyable Electro- mechanical Actuator test stand), allows testing EMA fault
    detection and prognosis technologies in flight environment, thus substantially increasing
    their technology readiness level u2013 all without the expense of dedicated flights,
    as the stand is designed to function as a non-intrusive secondary payload. No aircraft
    modifications are required and data can be collected during any available flight
    opportunity: pilot currency flights, ferry flights, or flights dedicated to other
    experiments. The stand is currently equipped with a prototype version of NASA Ames
    developed prognostic health management system with models aimed at detecting and
    tracking several fault types. At this point the team has completed test flights
    of the stand on US Air Force C-17 aircraft and US Army UH-60 helicopters and more
    experiments, both laboratory and airborne, are planned for the coming months.",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
