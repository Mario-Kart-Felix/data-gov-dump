    feature dataset, with several polygon feature classes, rather than a single feature
    class. SurfaceManagementAgency: The Surface Management Agency (SMA) Geographic Information
    System (GIS) dataset depicts Federal land for the United States and classifies this
    land by its active Federal surface managing agency. The SMA feature class covers
    the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa
    and the Virgin Islands. A Federal SMA agency refers to a Federal agency with administrative
    jurisdiction over the surface of Federal lands. Jurisdiction over the land is defined
    when the land is either: Withdrawn by some administrative or legislative action,
    or Acquired or Exchanged by a Federal Agency. This layer is a dynamic assembly of
    spatial data layers maintained at various federal and local government offices.
    The GIS data contained in this dataset represents the polygon features that show
    the boundaries for Surface Management Agency and the surface extent of each Federal
    agencyu00e2u0080u0099s surface administrative jurisdiction. SMA data depicts current
    withdrawn areas for a particular agency and (when appropriate) includes land that
    was acquired or exchanged and is located outside of a withdrawal area for that agency.
    The SMA data do not illustrate land status ownership pattern boundaries or contain
    land ownership attribute details. SMA_Withdrawals: The Surface Management Agency
    (SMA) Withdrawals Geographic Information System (GIS) dataset includes all of the
    known withdrawals which transfer surface jurisdictional responsibilities to federal
    agencies. The SMA Withdrawls feature class covers the continental United States,
    Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands. A Federal
    SMA Withdrawal is defined by formal actions that set aside, withhold, or reserve
    Federal land by statute or administrative order for public purposes. A withdrawal
    creates a title encumbrance on the land. Withdrawals must accomplish one or more
    of the following: A. Transfer total or partial jurisdiction of Federal land between
    Federal agencies. B. Close (segregate) Federal land to operation of all or some
    of the public land laws and/or mineral laws. C. Dedicate Federal land to a specific
    public purpose. There are four major categories of formal withdrawals: (1) Administrative,
    (2) Presidential Proclamations, (3) Congressional, and (4) Federal Power Act (FPA)
    or Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Withdrawals. These SMA Withdrawals
    will include the present total extent of withdrawn areas rather than all of the
    individual withdrawal actions that created them over time. These data do not illustrate
    land status ownership pattern boundaries or contain land ownership attribute details.
    SPP_WithdrawalAreas: The Special Public Purpose (SPP) Withdrawals Geographic Information
    System (GIS) dataset includes all of the known SPP Withdrawal Areas, which limit
    use or access to Federal lands (e.g. Wilderness, National Monument). The Special
    Public Purpose Withdrawal Areas feature class covers the continental United States,
    Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands. A Federal
    SPP Withdrawal Area is defined by formal actions that set aside, withhold, or reserve
    Federal land by statute or administrative order for public purposes. A withdrawal
    creates a title encumbrance on the land. Withdrawals must accomplish one or more
    of the following: A. Transfer total or partial jurisdiction of Federal land between
    Federal agencies. B. Close (segregate) Federal land to operation of all or some
    of the public land laws and/or mineral laws. C. Dedicate Federal land to a specific
    public purpose. There are four major categories of formal withdrawals: (1) Administrative,
    (2) Presidential Proclamations, (3) Congressional, and (4) Federal Power Act (FPA)
    or Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Withdrawals. These SPP Withdrawals
    include the present total extent of withdrawn areas rather than all of the individual
    withdrawal actions that created them over time. These data do not illustrate land
    status ownership pattern boundaries or contain land ownership attribute details.",nt"license_title":
