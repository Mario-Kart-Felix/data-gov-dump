    and owls (raptors) were detected during playback surveys conducted between 28 March
    2005 and 21 July 2005 along 36 randomly selected watercourses in the foothills of
    the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. These data represent 260 positive responses for
    several species of hawks and owls to the playback surveys. This study was done by
    the North Central Region of the California Department of Fish and Game with support
    from the Resource Assessment Program. These data represent the point locations where
    individual hawks and owls were detected based on geographic algorithms using estimated
    distances and compass bearings from fixed points along public roads. Methodology:
    Playback surveys using MP3 players and battery-powered speakers were done to elicit
    vocal or behavioral responses from hawks and owls from fixed points along public
    roads in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The surveys were done along 36 randomly
    selected watercourses, and one or three surveys were done at the points between
    March and July 2005. Seventeen watercourses had one survey while 19 watercourses
    had three surveys. Survey periods were (1) March to mid-April, (2) late April to
    late May, and (3) June to July. Watercourses with one survey were surveyed during
    the March to mid-April period; watercourses with one survey were dropped from the
    study after the first survey due to logistic and manpower constraints. Each watercourse
    had 3-5 fixed points that were between 500-1,000 meters apart to ensure spatial
    independence. Hawk surveys were conducted between 8:00 am and 5:00 pm, while owl
    surveys were conducted between 8:30 pm and 4:15 am. Playback surveys were done with
    fixed sequences of species",nt"license_title": null,nt"extras": [{ntt"key":
