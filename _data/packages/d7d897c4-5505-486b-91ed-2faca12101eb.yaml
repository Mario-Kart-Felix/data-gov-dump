    is the link to the RTI wiki. rnrnResearch Test and Integration (RTI) focuses on
    the development of long term plans for test and integration opportunities for research
    products from the SSAT, VSST, and AEST projects. RTI planning is primarily focused
    on AvSafe projects, however collaboration also includes other NASA programs, other
    government agencies, as well as industry and academic partners. This Wiki is intended
    to document the Research Test and Integration Plan (RTIP). The purpose of RTIP is
    to keep track of significant AvSafe research activities and maintain a database
    of testing facilities and assets available to enable and enhance the AvSafe research
    milestones. In addition RTIP will facilitate the development of collaborative research
    testing plans. This research collaboration will enable pooling research and test
    activities where possible. This pooling of research and test activities has the
    possibility of creating benefits that include: rnrn1. increasing the Technology
    Readiness Level for test activities with little or no additional cost to perform
    the tests, rn2. improving the quality of research activities by increasing the quantity
    of data sets available to researchers through the acquisition of test data via ride-along
    test activities which add little or no additional cost, and rn3. increasing the
    overall knowledge base by improving communication among principal investigators
    and research partners while reducing the duplication of work. rn",nt"license_title":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
