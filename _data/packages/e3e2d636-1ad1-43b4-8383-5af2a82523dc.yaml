    Fisheries Independent Survey (SEFIS) are conducting research on Red Snapper (lutjanus

    2010 by the NOAA Ship Nancy Foster with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002
    multibeam echo sounder (95 kHz). It was processed by NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography
    Branch using FlederMause 7 Geocoder and Hypack 2012 Geocoder. The processed backscatter
    data was used to generate an 8 bit GeoTiff that was exported to ArcGIS 10 for aditional
