  true,\n\t\"url\": null,\n\t\"notes\": \"&lt;p&gt;Nuclear reactors, which power nuclear
  propulsion and power systems, and the nuclear radiation and residual radioactivity
  associated with these systems, impose significant constraints on technology and
  system development programs due to radiation safety, environmental contamination,
  and nuclear security concerns. There is a rigorous and time consuming process that
  is required for obtaining a nuclear reactor site license. Additionally, the development
  and testing of nuclear propulsion and power systems will have to rely on existing
  nuclear reactor research facilities, which only marginally meet NTP development
  needs. These facts, in combination with the increased security measures and standards
  required to safeguard nuclear material, limit the options available for developing
  new nuclear reactor research sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome nuclear facility
  infrastructure shortfalls and to mitigate the range of potential &amp;ldquo;nuclear
  concerns&amp;rdquo;, one approach to develop required technologies to enable NTP
  capabilities, is to separate the development of core nuclear reactor subsystem elements
  from the development of the critical (and more numerous and diverse) downstream
  thermal management and control system elements. By separating them, the limited
  number of nuclear reactor research sites can concentrate on reactor system development
  without interference from the development of downstream elements. In this way, separate,
  non-nuclear test facilities can be designed and built to develop the other system
  elements required to convert the heat from a nuclear reactor to thrust, electricity,
  or other applicable components&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuclear Propulsion
  and Power Non-Nuclear Test Facility (NP2NTF) represents a feasible extrapolation
  for extending Stennis Space Center&amp;rsquo;s (SSC&amp;rsquo;s) existing experience
  and expertise in designing and operating state-of-the-art, high flow rate, high
  pressure cryogenic piping systems for hydrogen and other propellants, as well as
  competencies in components, and instrumentation for special test equipment used
  in rocket propulsion testing are particularly relevant. SSC&amp;rsquo;s experience
  in managing complex rocket propulsion test facilities and rigorous rocket propulsion
  test projects and engine qualification experience are key competencies that would
  be required for NP2NTF development and subsequent operation. SSC&amp;rsquo;s extensive
  infrastructure that is in place, which is used for storing and utilizing large quantities
  of liquid hydrogen (LH) and liquid oxygen (LOX) is also a significant component
  required to the efficient and cost-effective operation of the NP2NTF. SSC&amp;rsquo;s
  systems analysis and modeling capability, based on first-principles fluid physics
  and thermodynamics phenomena and routinely used to model, simulate, and predict
  the performance of SSC rocket propulsion test facilities, is also ideally suited
  for supporting NP2NFT design and facility characterization and performance prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By
  separating out the development testing of non-reactor core system elements, which
  comprise the bulk of nuclear propulsion and power systems, a NP2NTF would enable
  faster, less expensive, more efficient, and safer technology maturation and system
  development by eliminating the need to acquire and implement assets and infrastructure
  required for nuclear research. In this way, the development of core nuclear reactor
  system elements can be concentrated upon separately. SSC investigated these technologies,
  identified technology development options and performance requirements, and assessed
  feasibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\",\n\t\"license_title\":

  \"NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
  do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
  been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
  some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
  we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
  make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
  called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
  still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
  and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
  Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
  human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
  system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
  of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
  demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
  boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
  spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
  might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
  as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
  to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
  Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
  is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
  as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
  science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
  and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
  universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
  and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.\",\n\t\t\"created\": \"2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521\",\n\t\t\"title\":
