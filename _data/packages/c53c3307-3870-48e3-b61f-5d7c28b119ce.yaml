    has enabled the possibility of reasonably sized, high specific power, high power,
    solar arrays.  At high specific powers, power levels ranging from 50 to several
    hundred kW are feasible.  Coupled with gridded ion thruster technology, this power
    technology can be mission enabling for a wide range of missions ranging from ambitious
    near Earth NASA missions to those missions involving other customers as well such
    as DOD and commercial satellite interests.  Indeed the HEFT clearly identified the
    need for high power electric.  The appeal of the ion thrusters for such applications
    stems from their overall high efficiency, typically &gt;70&#37; and long life.  In
    response to the need for a single, high powered engine to fill the gulf between
    the 7 kW NEXT system and a notional 25 kW engine, a Phase I activity to build a
    25 kW, 50 cm ion thruster discharge chamber was completed with a laboratory model
    fabricated. The proposed Phase II effort aims to mature the laboratory model into
    a proto-engineering model ion thruster.  The proposed effort involves the evolution
    of the discharge chamber to a high performance thruster by performance testing and
    characterization via simulated and full beam extraction testing. Through such testing
    the design will be optimized leading ultimately to the proposed design, build and
    preliminary checkout of a proto-engineering model thruster, thereby advancing the
    TRL level to 4-5 range.  Deliverables include the thruster, a design package, and
    a performance data document.",nt"license_title": "U.S. Government Work",nt"extras":

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
