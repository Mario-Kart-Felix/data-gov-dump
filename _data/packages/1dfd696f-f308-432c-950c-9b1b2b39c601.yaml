    (LAI), dendrometry band measurements, and litterfall mass from samples collected
    at the km 67 research site, Topajos National Forest, Para, Brazil. Litterfall collections
    were from January 23, 2004 through December 3, 2004, dendrometer measurements were
    monthly between December 2003 and December 2004, and LAI measurements were collected
    from January 26, 2004 through November 3, 2004.All measurements were taken at the
    km 67 site in the Tapajos National Forest. This site is situated in an area of Amazonian
    primary tropical forest belonging to the municipality of Belterra, Para, Brazil.
    The forest is mostly evergreen with a few deciduous species. The canopy is characterized
    by large emergent trees up to 55-m tall, with a closed canopy at approximately 40-m;
    there are few indications of recent anthropogenic disturbance other than hunting
    trails. Measurement plots (50) were established along 4 transects at the site and
    within each plot, 5 subplots were established. The longest transect (25 m x 500
    m) was the location of 20 (25 m x 25 m) plots. The other 3 transects (25 m x 250
    m) contain 10 plots per transect. Note that the assignment of plots to transects
    is not provided.There are four comma-delimited data files (.csv) with this data

    "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we
    do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have
    been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer
    some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will
    we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will
    make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations,
    called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that
    still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety
    and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International
    Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and
    human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar
    system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits
    of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops,
    demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the
    boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach
    spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it
    might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn,
    as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues
    to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space
    Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station
    is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such
    as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth
    science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate
    and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations,
    universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience
    and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",ntt"created": "2013-03-14T03:44:44.467521",ntt"title":
