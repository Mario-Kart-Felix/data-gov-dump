	"notes": "OPTRA proposes the development of an imaging spectrometer for greenhouse gas and volcanic gas imaging based on matched spectral filtering and compressive imaging.  The matched spectral filter compressive imager (MSF-CI) system will be capable of simultaneously imaging and quantifying a series of compounds of interest via passive IR spectroscopy from an airborne or space-based platform.The MSF-CI operates in the 3-5.5 micron spectral range and employs two digital micromirror devices (DMDs) &amp;#150; one to encode the spatial information and a second to encode the spectral information &amp;#150; a dispersive spectrometer, and a single element thermoelectrically cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector.  The proposed system offers a significant cost advantage relative to both imagers and hyperspectral imagers presently available in this spectral range as it does not require a costly infrared focal plane array (FPA).  Moreover, the MSF-CI makes efficient use of compressive sensing and matched spectral filtering, resulting in minimized data bandwidth while preserving the information of interest.  In addition, the use of the DMD in place of a conventional FPA offers significantly better image uniformity, pixel operability, signal to noise at low light levels, and dynamic range.  The overall package is expected to be compact and rugged, making it ideal for airborne/space based applications.  The proposed Phase I effort will produce a breadboard MSF-CI system which will be characterized and used for a carbon dioxide imaging demonstration.",

		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.rnrnTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?rnrnNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:rn rnAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.rnrnHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.rnrnScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.rnrnSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.rnrnIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.rnrnCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.rnrnEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",
